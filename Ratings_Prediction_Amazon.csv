0,4.0,"I'm writing this review after using almost a month. As all said in the review that there's a heating problem, there is. But only if you use laptop for heavy updates and also depends on your usage. Not that much noticeable.
About touch it's very good and very responsive/sensitive. ( Talking about finger touch)
For pen touch I personally find a little bit difficulty because pen touch is not sensitive as much as finger touch but after apply a little more pressure it works wonderfully.

Battery life is pretty good works for 4-5 hours.

Overall it's a great laptop with this price 70K with 360 rotation and touch screen."

7,4.0,"I bought this laptop one month ago and almost immediately started facing issues with it. The battery life is not more than 3.5 hours after a full charge.

Take my word for it and dont buy this laptop. Totally not worth the money. I myself regret this purchase.

If your budget is around 27k and not purchasing for gaming then you should difinitely go for it. There are hardly any cons in this product.
#Built quality is upto the mark.
#Looks and feels premium like a 40k laptop
#Fingerprint sensor is what makes it different.
#Processing speed is fluent.
#Camera is ok ok (enough).
#Touchpad feels premium.
#SSD makes it a bit more buttery.
#Display quality is more than good in this budget.

The only problem i faced is regarding MS office as OFFICE 365 is pre installed without the activation key as a result we cant access it or we have to purchase it. But fortunately i installed MS office 2021 from external source in minutes so not a big deal.

436,5.0,"the laptop whole package is awesome. although its a bit pricey you get 3 year warranty and you get qhd 500 nits screen and 6gb graphics nvidia rtx model and msoffice 2019 included with the price and also get highly customizable feature rich and visually attractive bios and lenovo vantage app and x-rite colour assistant app which are used for controlling software and hardware settings and features.

you have to contact emailid pop@lenovo.com (mention serial number of laptop in subject) to update the warranty. lenovo asks a ton of things like invoice from amazon, email from amazon confirming the order, p-slip from amazon indicating the serial number of the laptop, photo of the sticker on your machine which consists of the System Serial number and the MTM details.

here are some shortcuts
Fn + q === to change thermal modes
the power button led shows red white blue colour for following modes
Performance Mode -- Boost your computer performance with higher fan speed and power consumption. Performance Mode is applicable only when ac power adaptor is plugged in.
Balance Mode--Automatically adjust the performance and fan speed according to the system requirement.
Quiet Mode---Keep quiet by reducing your computer performance and fan speed where possible with low power consumption
Fn + space === to turn off/on and change keyboard rgb lighting profiles
rgb lighting profiles can be customized and turned on off in lenovo vantage app
Fn + L=== to turn off/on the legion logo lighting on the back of the laptop screen

in lenovo vantage app, if you turn on hybrid mode, then the system uses both amd integrated graphics card and nvidia graphics card. if hybrid mode is off, then the system uses only nvidia graphics card.

it has a hardware switch to disable the webcam.

there is rapid charge setting for battery in lenovo vantage app, which charges the battery quickly. but don't use it as the battery life reduces. the battery gives only two&half hours to three hours if you are just browsing internet in chrome and watching youtube. if you are doing cpu intensive tasks like copying files or virus scan, or watching 4k 8k videos, the battery backup time reduces further.

there are a ton of customizations in lenovo vantage app and x-rite colour assistant app to change hardware and software settings and features. check them out.

as soon as you get the laptop, don't connect to internet while you login to windows first time after purchase ( do customizations like privacy settings as per your preferences). once you login to windows first time after purchase, connect to internet and update everything in laptop, make windows updates first as it automatically gets updates for lenovo hardware and lenovo apps. then go to lenovo vantage app and do system update if any are available ( like bios update etc)

i played 4k and 8k videos in vlc with hybrid mode off and using only nvidia graphics and thermal mode in performance mode. the 4k videos played without any issues although the cpu temperatures rich 65-75 degree centigrade. as for 8k videos, as the framerate increases and intensity & speed of scene changes increases, there is a huge 4-5 second freeze in the videos. the system is unable to play the 8k videos with high frame rates.

i did not play any games.

you have to activate your license of MS office 2019. check the web and YouTube for how to do that"
437,5.0,"Pros:
Good specs, others have written enough about it, so will not repeat.
It works fine, unlike others I do not have a problem with the lighting, it's working fine. Touch wood.
Battery is on expected lines, I'm looking at the Apple M2 pro, with great battery life.

Cons:
They wanted to differentiate this laptop as a lower spec'd one so they introduced a pedestrian design language. Not the sleek one reserved for Legion 7. Newer models, they have corrected it. But, since the marketing dept even thought about this cheap move. I'm knocking one star off overall. Way to *iss off customers, Lenovo. When we're already paying top dollar, why do this?"
438,5.0,"(1 month usage update below)

I read a lot of reviews before I got this. Things that I was concerned about -
- might seem plasticky
- keyboard and trackpad might be uncomfortable
- weight
- size
- speakers
- heat for regular mobile usage (couch, chair) while not gaming

I have not used it for any gaming yet so don't have any observations around that.

Overall - does not feel plasticky at all. Nice premium feel overall. Looks and feels great.

Keyboard and trackpad were my biggest concerns but they are good. I don't have issues. Keyboard is super nice to type. Takes some getting used to - especially around the backspace key area. Typing speed was around my usual 75 wpm.

Size and weight - fits my laptop backpack which used to fit a 14"" Razer Blade. It is largish but not crazily so. Using it feels like having a monitor on your lap. Gorgeous display and nice to use, see and read. Definitely heavy but manageable.

Speakers - good enough for me. I had no issues. Sufficiently loud and clear.

Heat - I intend to use this on the couch or chair a lot and didn't want it to be uncomfortably warm or HAVE to use a lap table or desk. It is cool always (not gaming) and very comfortable to use. I use it mostly in the quiet mode and it really is completely quiet. Absolutely no concerns here so far.

Pricy as usual in India but overall very happy with the purchase. Hope it lasts me a while. Recommend big time!

****** Update after 1 month of regular usage *****

Quiet Mode is very cool and quiet but takes a lot of performance away. Switching to balance is a huge boost in performance. When connected to power, balanced mode seems like the way to go.

Battery - I keep mine to battery saver (60% charge only). With 60Hz refresh rate, quiet mode I get about 3 and a half hours of battery life without gaming for regular usage. I find this quite reasonable for my usage currently.

Gaming - I only play AoE2 DE. That works just great.

Issues:
- Occasionally, Fn + R will stop changing refresh rate. The only solution I know so far (haven't researched enough) is to reboot. But refresh rate can be changed from Advanced Display Settings even when Fn + R stops working.

- Very rarely, trackpad can be a little annoying during gaming but easy enough to switch off.

- Not an issue, but an annoyance - some Lenovo advertisement for some performance services used to pop up in the first couple of weeks. Haven't noticed it recently.

- I still hit num lock instead of backspace after all these weeks :-)

Most issues are quite trivial and very manageable.

I still like this laptop very much and will keep the 5 stars."
439,5.0,Bought laptop from Amazon for first time. Got new one in good condition. Good for gaming. Using it for many months and have not faced any issues.
440,5.0,"Ok so this is a great gaming laptop no doubt...
Happy using this laptop since 1 week and I found that the battery life is not so great but it's ok like you cannot expect a good battery life with any gaming laptop.
Performance is just too good like it's hard to believe the performance it gives with the RtX 3060 gpu with the AMD ryzen 5800h cpu inside.
Recommended to play game while charging it as it will give you great performance. No problem with backlit keyboard in my unit and I think it's just the software issues many users are facing with keyboard.
Build quality is awesome and the body can get heated very much so be careful about that while gaming.
The QHD display with 165hz refresh rate is very nice and is so good to play games and watch movies on it.
The laptop and its charger combined are very bulky (3.5kgs) and not advised to carry around but it's ok...
You can buy this laptop without any doubt..
Overall it's worth it!"
441,5.0,"This is the best gaming performance I've had from a system ever. Moving from Nitro 5 to this has been a heavenly experience. Tried a few games, some GPU heavy and some CPU heavy and wasn't disappointed.

The only reason I'm reducing 1 star from this feedback is that there seems to be software issues with Lenovo's proprietary software that they themselves don't know what to do about.

Their inhouse software Lenovo Vantage which is supposed to be used to control everything about the laptop including the backlighting of the keyboard has some options missing from the ones they advertise online. My particular model doesn't have any option to modify or turn off the backlighting so now it is stuck in a flashy rainbow loop endlessly. Even though people who have received this laptop in other parts of the world haven't faced this issue, I've seen a couple of people reporting this problem in India and Lenovo support is completely clueless as to how this can be resolved

Edit: Dropping the review down to 1 star based purely on the experience with Legion 'Premium' Tech Support. Every time you call them they have the same response, they run the automatic diagnostic tool on the Lenovo website (which I did before even contacting them) and when that doesn't resolve the issue, they say they'll get back within a day and then there is no response. You need to keep calling for follow ups. After a week of having this laptop, five days out of which I have been on tech support calls for over an hour (including the hold) , their resolution is, ""We can't be bothered to check where this issue is coming from even though people have been reporting it for over a month now. We will not send a software patch to fix this issue. We can replace the device for you"". When I asked for the replacement they redirected me to Amazon and since it's out of stock on Amazon now, their only response is return the device and take your money back. Nobody wants to actually work towards finding a solution even though this has been present on Lenovo forums for quite some time now (Lenovo forums are as useless, in case anybody was wondering). Even though the laptop is amazing, and I considered just using it with the flashing rainbow in my face all the time, the way Lenovo has acted here tells me how they'll handle any other issues in case they arise in the future and it isn't very promising. Won't recommend."
442,2.0,"Initially thought that the 16"" laptop was a bit bulky, but it turned around to be much like any other 15.6"" laptop as the bezzels are so thin.

Those who are looking for a productive and gaming laptop, just go for it. The 16"" 165Hz QHD display is perfectly calibrated.

For the gamers, the thermals are quite stable and you will not hear the fans running unless and until you are playing graphic intensive games.

The sound quality is good. Thanks to the built-in application Nahimic which brings immersive sound experience to your speakers as well as external headphones or other output devices. Another main feature is that with this, you can connect to two bluetooth/plugged in headphones at the same time and the laptop stream sounds without any audio lag. There is also an additional option with the Nahimic app we can change the surrond sound, volume stabilizer, bass and treble and there are 5 profiles for the sound- music, movie, communication, gaming and smart. All the modes have very different characteristics.

I havn't tested the HDR and Dolby Vision but i am sure that it will do a great job with this gorgeous display.

Coming to the waranty part, you get three years of waranty which can be seen while taking Lenovo Vantage preintalled app and 13 months of Legion ultimate support. The screenshot has been attached with this review.

Will get 1 month of Xbox Game Pass and Microsoft Office home and student 2019 with this machine.

Will update further if I find anything else"
443,5.0,"Overall the best high end laptop you can buy in market. Only concern is of the touchpad which is very bad. I find it very difficult to use it to control mouse movements. I bought the laptop when it was Rs. 1.34L with some offers which reduced another 7K.

I believe it is not worth for 1.6L. If you can continue using old laptop till AMD brings new cpu which supports DDR 5. Or better look at new intel cpu which supports DDR5. DDR5 rams are very costly now but will eventually stabilise"
444,2.0,"Even after reading several negative views from customers, decided to trust, the brand, the seller and Am7azon. Received faulty laptop today morning. Display didn't start. Talked for an hour with Lenovo Customer Service. Who has promised an inspection and possible replacement...
Will update further developments...
So right now, only a star.

22/09/2021
Inspection was carried out by Amazon. As few reviews suggested, that out of stock pieces are refrred back to Amazon by Lenovo Customer Care, so decided to contact Amazon. Piece defective. As expected, no piece in stock, Amazon has promised retun and refund.
But waiting for pick up since 2 days. Nobody has turned up. Delaying my refund.
Since it was exchanged with old laptop, I am literally without any machine to work from home. Pathetic and insensitive, all those responsible for this farce.
Shall update further.
27/09/2021
Waiting for pickup since 21-26 6 days in row. Pickup is booked. Gets cancelled. Since last 6 days.
Tried to explain Amazon Customer care, which keeps on creating new Pickup everyday. Initially they did daily, since last 2 times they are creating pick up every alternate day.
Asked their agents, they say pick was cancelled by me.
Not able to understand:
1. Amazon says, I am cancelling pickup (of defaulted Lenovo Legion 5 Pro) while with every cancel, is backed by new pickup request. BTW, What I would do with faulty laptop, whichjust a piece of junk for me.
2. And why would I place an immediate request for pickup, after a failed puckup attempt, if I am cancelling pickup at my place.
C.C. executives understand but, are jus pawn, don't know how to solve it.
This is the routine for past 10 days.
Initially they promised me advance refund, then they continued with old story that I am cancelling the pickup.
The biggest culprit is seller, Appario Retail, who sold defective product. Brand Lenovo, is yet another bigger culprit, who doesn't have simplest quality control.
Well, tomorrow there is yet another pickup scheduled.
Amazon's internal system is being screwed by someone, insider. And management is clueless.
Shall update tomorrow with pickup details.

02/10/2021
Pickup didn't happen on 28th Sept 2021. But new twist happened. I was advised by a customer care representative to for replacement instead of return. I agreed. Replacement was to happen today. But......
The same reason of failed verification of old laptop, was not picked up, and replacement went back from my door. Customer care now says they can't replace, they will give me refund. Totally confused and feel helpless. Nothing that I can do except wait for another 72 hours after which pick up is arranged.
So now over to Tuesday 5th October 2021."
445,2.0,"Awesome. Works quite well. Loved the features. Has the latest generation tech as of today
It did have a problem with the Lenovo vantage (couldn't change lighting, battery settings, update software, etc). Had to update the bios manually for that after a support technician helped through the Lenovo community.
Would've liked per key lighting instead of 4 zone backlight for this price though.
One thing to note is the VRAM in the RTX 3060 is only 6gb. It's more than enough to play all games but some of the latest ones can't be played in ultra settings without stuttering and frame rate drop."
446,2.0,"Pre ordered and got it on 7th August.

Day-1 experience: started playing Doom Eternal.
Observations:
1) Very smooth gameplay and got that high definition gaming vala feeling.
2) Laptop build quality is Amazing and sturdy. Feels Premium.
3) This laptop comes with 6GB graphics - when set at suitable high end settings and played doom enternal - after a while fan noise increases (this is expected for high intense tasks) but did not feel much heat on the keyboard and game went very very smooth without any disturbance.
note: I played continuously for 2.5 to 3 hrs only
4) Laptop's Audio output is decent
5) The 720p Webcam is ok
6) Price- i am really not sure if this is high or reasonable compared to other gaming laptops. I personally like Lenovo.
(I have an ideapad bought in 2016 and it is still pretty much alive and not a single problem - so I built the trust from here)

Planning to play other games as well from Xbox game pass and will update the review or post a youtube video.

But as of day 1 : 5 stars and loved it!"
447,5.0,"Excellent Machine, Really good laptop from Lenovo. This is my 2nd Laptop also from Lenovo.
1st one was from 2012 the very initial flagship of Lenovo Y500 (those days Lenovo was only one competing Dell Alienware, also the better/only other option). It lasted 8 Years, only few hiccups in touch pad.

This really met my expectations from Lenovo, Creating build, size and quality. Remarkable sound quality and Display (16:10 is the best).
Got the laptop at a decent price (128k) even during the scarcity of laptops and video cards.

The 300W charger is hefty but, for this beast to run at its full potential with the 6GB RTX graphics its necessary. Could have a card reader port Thunder bolt charging."
448,2.0,"The legion 5 pro is. a beast
There are many reviews and utube reviews
i will keept it short
1. best cooling
2.sound is immense...its just awesome
3. display is qhd and bezel less...just feels heavenly while gaming or watching a movie because it had hdr+ certified
4. gpu is rtx 3060 130 tgp and it cam almost play any game ..i get 100+ fps in highest settings in gta V and the 165Hz refresh rate is just awesome if u are switching from 60 to 165
5. fps games are running so smooth..u will love it
6. 3 years warranty...XD WOW
Cons
1. since its a beast it consumes. a lot of power so yeah average battery life ..bcox 165Hz screen also consumes power so when you are not gaming u can switch on hybrid mode
2. could have been cheaper a bit but perfect at this price range
3. the vantage app is so odd and not much features are availble

Cons dont value much ..
just listen to this
Go for it...beacuse this is the best GAMING laptop
thank you"
449,1.0,"Lenovo Legion5 -PRO is highly recommended, its the only laptop worth buying for its price point, got mine delivered by amazon in 4 days, been using it for 2 weeks, comes with a surprise 3 year warranty by default.
the gaming performance is awesome , specially since it is the only laptop in India with a non crippled GPU . battery life in quiet mode is almost 6 hours, little lower than 8 hour advertised under ideal conditions.
if you want to buy a laptop primarily for gaming, go for it, the CPU and GPU are both non crippled, and as far as i know, its the only laptop with full 130W NVIDIA 3060 GPU .
and yes laptop is heavy ,great build quality , and heat is not an issue ,just don't keep it on your lap when gaming and you are fine."
450,5.0,"Gaming - You can't find better than it in the whole world within this price range!

Battery life - Oh!if your main focus is to get more and more battery life,then please stay away from it.

Content creation - It has a QHD panel(16:10) which comes with 100% sRGB.You can easily imagine about it's productivity.Just get it!

Value for money - Everything is best in it in this price range,except the 1Rx8 dual channel ram sticks(Still it is beating some of the rtx 3070 laptops with it's full powered rtx 3060 variants)

Verdict - If your main concern is gaming or productivity and you got the budget,blindly go for it.If you just want batterey life and lightweight laptop,then don't go for it,it's somewhat heavy.But I am also a college student and I didn't face any problem for it's weight still now."
451,5.0,"Top notch gaming performance and top notch display. Only issue is the camera, it is not good at all, even for a gaming laptop. Battery is like 2 hr with Rtx gpu and 165hz refresh rate on. Speaker is also okayish, not that great. If your focus is only gaming, then you can go for it blindly, don't need to think twice for it. I got it for 123k at Amazon Great Indian Sale. Even for 140k it is a stellar deal. Best gaming laptop in india atleast with 3 years of warranty."
452,5.0,"The laptop's built quality of top-notch and full metal alloy construction. Keyboards has good travel distance and no!!! There is no RGB lighting problem. Check attached pics.
I'm not gonna bore u with laptop details.
You also get 1 months x Box game pass subscription.
Laptop heats up during gaming, I would suggest using a cooling pad or an elevated stand it so that it can suck up more air and keeps the laptop cool.
Only disappointed because didn't get a free backpack which u would have otherwise gotten if ordered from Lenovo's website.
And the power brick is1 kg and in total is 3.5 kg with the laptop so portibility is not an option.
Overall superb laptop with great performance.
Can easily recommend.

The laptop comes with Intel wifi card not realtek. Check attached pic."

165hz 2k display most elegant in the market
Arguably best cooling system the coolfront3

Now the downsides
The battery is okay for gaming gives almost an hour for gaming
( For normal stuff there are 3 power modes and option to change display from 165hz to 60 for normal usage so this will give more then 3-4 hours )

The RGB lighting keyboard isn’t so great it’s very average"
454,2.0,You can't ask for anything better. A bit pricey but 0 complains.
455,1.0,"The Legion 5 Pro is an absolute beast of a computing machine! The thermals are excellent even in the scorching Indian summers, the 2560*1600 16:10 display with VESA certified HDR400 is a marvel to look at, and the build quality is as solid as it gets for a gaming laptop. The entire laptop has a metallic finish and feels solid to the touch. The rubber stands underneath the laptop are deep enough to allow for considerable airflow but I would recommend raising the back atleast a few inches during intense gaming sessions. The keyboard has a soft-touch finish to it and it is a pleasure to type on."
456,1.0,"Lenovo Legion 5 Pro fails to deliver on the PRO moniker. An expensive device costing 1.55 Lakhs has some unforgiving shortcomings and I had to spend ₹15000 more to rectify its serious hardware shortcomings.

1. Comes with a ULTRA CRAPPY MediaTek MT7921 Wifi 6 card. Seriously this card is worst in the world and my upload & download speeds went to 10 MBPS no matter what I did. Mind it I have a 200MBPS Airtel Xstream broadband. Had to spend ₹5000 to upgrade with an Intel AX210 wifi module.

2. It comes with SLOW single rank X16 RAM modules and I got upto 20% less performance in some games like Shadow of the Tomb Raider, Horizon zero dawn, COD Warzone etc. Had to spend ₹10000 for two X8 RAM sticks (2x8 GB).

3. Mobile RTX3060 is good but not future proof. Nvidea played cheap trick by limiting its VRAM to 6GB and that's why this graphic card is not enough to play many games in ultra textures as VRAM runs out (Watch dogs Legion, COD-Warzone etc.). Fore reference, the desktop version of 3060 come with 12GB VRAM.
4. Highly Overpriced. Lenovo is selling the 3060 gpu model in India at the price of 3070 model and on top of it comes with inferior RAM and Wifi.

Everything else is fine."
457,1.0,"Received the laptop today and it is as just as in the description i.e. just wonderful and amazing. The only thing is that delivery guy brought the package to me without the box from Amazon but it was sealed so accept it and Amazon must be careful from next as laptops are fragile so maximum protection is needed. Also, while buying the laptop from Amazon they didn't seems to send the bag as well which is a disadvantage means you need to purchase bag seperately overall there is no issues with the laptop or anything and if you need a gaming laptop just go for this one and won't regret it."
458,3.0,Display and built quality are the best of all which stands out with its competitors. I spent some time playing valorant at medium settings. The cpu temp goes to 75 degrees and GPU temp goes to 60 degrees. You will definitely notice a difference in the display. It's the best display a gaming laptop has.i didn't any fps drops.
459,1.0,"To all those interested in buying a lenovo laptop... Here's one you should read before you decide: DO NOT BUY THIS LAPTOP! THEY ARE TRYING TO SCAM YOU!!!
I'm a graphic designer, and I was looking for laptops in the range of rs 150000/-
I found the lenovo legion 5 pro among others, I decided to go for the lenovo because I have used a lenovo for years and I had a pretty likable experience in the past.
This has and will always be my biggest regrets; I made the mistake of buying the lenovo legion 5 pro AMD Ryzen 7, on the 5th of October 2021, it was delivered to me on the 10th, I bought the extended warranty, antivirus, my softwares and others, had them all installed on the laptop.
It worked smoothly for exactly 7 days, as if programmed with the last day of replacement of faulty product.
So on the 18th of October my laptop never came back on. It has been lying on my table dead to this day.
Apparently, with the lenovo legion, you get premium customer care, another spam, for namesake, they try to make you feel special but it's all a ruse, it's been a living hell talking to the premium customer care of lenovo legion, I speak to different people every time and have to explain my situation on each customer care call every day. Every call, all they say is ""please have patience, please wait for a few more days"" in 3 days I complete a month of having a dead laptop in my house, Lenovo refuses to let me go to the service station saying that it's not allowed, someone from their side has to come to my residence to evaluate my laptop. This is hasn't happened. On the 10th of November, it completed a month since I recieved the laptop from Amazon.
PLEASE PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS OR ANY OTHER LENOVO LAPTOPS!
IT WILL BE THE BIGGEST MISTAKE YOU MAKE!!! BEWARE!"
460,1.0,"If you dont care about the weight of the laptop (3.5 kilos with 300w charger brick) you can simply go for this laptop
If you care about less weight and performance at this price point Zephyrus laptop makes your money worth"
461,1.0,"Buy this laptop only if its in sale , because the performance your are getting from that price is very high
Awsome design, great cooling, and also very quite i cant even hear the fan spining from it, great performance,awsome display,

But 1 drawback is the laptop is heavy but its portable. And the charger is also heavy

I will recommend anyone to buy this laptop"
462,1.0,"Its just awesome , i didn't faced any keyboard backlight issues but i didn't found the lighting control first but after the update its available , and every thing is good but my only concern is the touchpad wabbling a little bit and thats it , its not a problem though , built like a tank and just loved it"
463,1.0,"Amazing performance, super smooth, great battery backup(note : after installing win11 the battery consumption increased it now only gives 3 hours of battery life or a bit more but if you are using on win11 always put it on power saving mode and use it, and on win10 it used to give around 6 hours of battery life)"

465,4.0,Gr8 laptop guys. Go for it if u can afford. Gr8 performance. And no issues with keyboard backlit as some reviews says so...i too had doubt. But no issues with laptop. Gr8 cooling too.
466,5.0,"I'd pre-ordered the laptop when it lauched and was super excited to check it out when it arrived before the specified date.

I was disappointed when i realized that the backlight controls were not working. No option to customize the lighting scheme too. A quick google search about the issue revealed that the problem was fairly common.

Tried updating the softwares, bios etc as suggested in the forums to no avail. Called lenovo customer care, was kept on hold for around 30 mins. I got fed up and disconnected. Finally i reached out to amazon support who scheduled a technician visit to decipher the issue. On the inspection day, the touchpad stopped working as well. The technician said that the problems could be due to some underlying hardware defects.

Initiated a refund immediately. Say what you want about how expensive apple products are, such QC issues rarely occur. Paying close to 1.4 lacs and encountering such issues is an absolute travesty."
467,5.0,Overall laptop is very good. But the realtek wifi card is the worst thing about this. It should have been intel
468,4.0,Buying this beauty is the best decision I've made so far. Absolutely satisfying gaming experience.
469,1.0,"Products brought from Amazon comes with only one year warranty only. Trying to resolve the issue .
Now the issue has been resolved. The very cooperative Lenovo team helped me out and the product warranty updated to three years."
470,5.0,What a beauty. In love with the screen and this beast is insanely fast. Ssd inside is too good.
471,4.0,Excellent performance for both gaming and productivity tasks.
472,1.0,"Excited for this one!
God speed delivery by Amazon! Thanks."
473,4.0,"Every feature of this laptop is amazing. But the RGB keyboard has some serious issues. It's not getting customized in the Lenevo Vantage app as well via the keybaord shortcut. This is a global issue with a lot of units. You can find the same issue on Lenevo website forums in detail. Few other buyers here on amazon mention the same issue as well.

I have initiated a return as I am not getting a replacement. Lenevo Ultimate Support is pathetic. You won't be able to reach out to them most of the time. I was lucky enough to get in touch with them and their customer guy gave a wrong e-mail id for communication.

Buy this laptop if you can live with the faulty RGV keyboard. Otherwise, this is a beast laptop."
474,5.0,Best for Gaming
475,5.0,its good
476,5.0,"There is no option to change lighting pattern or customize the behaviour in lenovo vantage software. Key shortcut is also not working.
After 2 days of troubleshooting by myself and lenovo customer care, I've returned the laptop."
477,5.0,Can't change RGB. Stuck in rainbow loop. On the verge of returning.
478,5.0,"New laptop had faulty mouse pad, Amazon could not exchange it, Amazon said they did not had spare Laptop, Lenevo said the will repair it, Imagine such a expensive laptop and very poor performance."
479,5.0,"They could have also offered a lower specced variant with 512GB of SSD and MS DOS instead of Windows 10, since many of us are upgrading our older laptops which have an SSD with Windows installed on it.
We'd just need to install that in this laptop. Would have ended up at approx. 1.15 lacs."
480,5.0,"I have bought this system around a month back.
Overall I have found this system is really good.
It has good built quality.
It has really nice performance.
It has sufficient processing power with AMD Ryzen 7.
I didn't find much heating issue.
I use this system on a day to day programming and I find it really powerful.
I haven't expanded it's RAM or SSD capacity. I am using it with stock feature.
I have upgraded it's OS to Windows 10 Pro 64 bit license which cost me around 7k INR.

Only one issue I have noticed is, It's trackpad is not that much good. I am need to attach external mouse to have good experience."
481,5.0,The laptop looks amazin 1.The 16:10 display is an overkill and the battery life on normal mode is poor but good on hybrid mood. Anyways just loved it..
482,5.0," I bought this laptop after a lot of research as I was investing 1.5 lac.

I have bought a lot of gaming laptop since my childhood... And have seen many in my friend circle....don't go with the naysayers!! These guys will always have a badluck ... whatever they will buy ;)

This laptop comes with a 3 months xbox membership, 3 years warranty and 1 year of premium support.

I compared with Alienware, Zyphrus and Rager blade. TUF (Asus) and Nitro (Acer) series doesn't even stand nearby....

It has one of the best screen.... 500 nits and 100% colour accuracy and 165 htz display is something which gives an advantage during gaming.

The built quality is just awesome.... All metal... The metalic color looks sexy..."
483,5.0,I bought this laptop and wham ! Half of my screen is not there ... I was sure it was some delivery issue and I contacted the delivery man he told nothing happened so I wanted to return this but amazon employee says u have made the damage .... I want refund amazon in my Amazon pay balance worst worst .....
484,2.0,"the laptop whole package is awesome. although its a bit pricey you get 3 year warranty and you get qhd 500 nits screen and 6gb graphics nvidia rtx model and msoffice 2019 included with the price and also get highly customizable feature rich and visually attractive bios and lenovo vantage app and x-rite colour assistant app which are used for controlling software and hardware settings and features.

you have to contact emailid pop@lenovo.com (mention serial number of laptop in subject) to update the warranty. lenovo asks a ton of things like invoice from amazon, email from amazon confirming the order, p-slip from amazon indicating the serial number of the laptop, photo of the sticker on your machine which consists of the System Serial number and the MTM details.

here are some shortcuts
Fn + q === to change thermal modes
the power button led shows red white blue colour for following modes
Performance Mode -- Boost your computer performance with higher fan speed and power consumption. Performance Mode is applicable only when ac power adaptor is plugged in.
Balance Mode--Automatically adjust the performance and fan speed according to the system requirement.
Quiet Mode---Keep quiet by reducing your computer performance and fan speed where possible with low power consumption
Fn + space === to turn off/on and change keyboard rgb lighting profiles
rgb lighting profiles can be customized and turned on off in lenovo vantage app
Fn + L=== to turn off/on the legion logo lighting on the back of the laptop screen

in lenovo vantage app, if you turn on hybrid mode, then the system uses both amd integrated graphics card and nvidia graphics card. if hybrid mode is off, then the system uses only nvidia graphics card.

it has a hardware switch to disable the webcam.

there is rapid charge setting for battery in lenovo vantage app, which charges the battery quickly. but don't use it as the battery life reduces. the battery gives only two&half hours to three hours if you are just browsing internet in chrome and watching youtube. if you are doing cpu intensive tasks like copying files or virus scan, or watching 4k 8k videos, the battery backup time reduces further.

there are a ton of customizations in lenovo vantage app and x-rite colour assistant app to change hardware and software settings and features. check them out.

as soon as you get the laptop, don't connect to internet while you login to windows first time after purchase ( do customizations like privacy settings as per your preferences). once you login to windows first time after purchase, connect to internet and update everything in laptop, make windows updates first as it automatically gets updates for lenovo hardware and lenovo apps. then go to lenovo vantage app and do system update if any are available ( like bios update etc)

i played 4k and 8k videos in vlc with hybrid mode off and using only nvidia graphics and thermal mode in performance mode. the 4k videos played without any issues although the cpu temperatures rich 65-75 degree centigrade. as for 8k videos, as the framerate increases and intensity & speed of scene changes increases, there is a huge 4-5 second freeze in the videos. the system is unable to play the 8k videos with high frame rates.

i did not play any games.

you have to activate your license of MS office 2019. check the web and YouTube for how to do that"
485,5.0,"Pros:
Good specs, others have written enough about it, so will not repeat.
It works fine, unlike others I do not have a problem with the lighting, it's working fine. Touch wood.
Battery is on expected lines, I'm looking at the Apple M2 pro, with great battery life.

Cons:
They wanted to differentiate this laptop as a lower spec'd one so they introduced a pedestrian design language. Not the sleek one reserved for Legion 7. Newer models, they have corrected it. But, since the marketing dept even thought about this cheap move. I'm knocking one star off overall. Way to *iss off customers, Lenovo. When we're already paying top dollar, why do this?"
486,4.0,"(1 month usage update below)

I read a lot of reviews before I got this. Things that I was concerned about -
- might seem plasticky
- keyboard and trackpad might be uncomfortable
- weight
- size
- speakers
- heat for regular mobile usage (couch, chair) while not gaming

I have not used it for any gaming yet so don't have any observations around that.

Overall - does not feel plasticky at all. Nice premium feel overall. Looks and feels great.

Keyboard and trackpad were my biggest concerns but they are good. I don't have issues. Keyboard is super nice to type. Takes some getting used to - especially around the backspace key area. Typing speed was around my usual 75 wpm.

Size and weight - fits my laptop backpack which used to fit a 14"" Razer Blade. It is largish but not crazily so. Using it feels like having a monitor on your lap. Gorgeous display and nice to use, see and read. Definitely heavy but manageable.

Speakers - good enough for me. I had no issues. Sufficiently loud and clear.

Heat - I intend to use this on the couch or chair a lot and didn't want it to be uncomfortably warm or HAVE to use a lap table or desk. It is cool always (not gaming) and very comfortable to use. I use it mostly in the quiet mode and it really is completely quiet. Absolutely no concerns here so far.

Pricy as usual in India but overall very happy with the purchase. Hope it lasts me a while. Recommend big time!

****** Update after 1 month of regular usage *****

Quiet Mode is very cool and quiet but takes a lot of performance away. Switching to balance is a huge boost in performance. When connected to power, balanced mode seems like the way to go.

Battery - I keep mine to battery saver (60% charge only). With 60Hz refresh rate, quiet mode I get about 3 and a half hours of battery life without gaming for regular usage. I find this quite reasonable for my usage currently.

Gaming - I only play AoE2 DE. That works just great.

Issues:
- Occasionally, Fn + R will stop changing refresh rate. The only solution I know so far (haven't researched enough) is to reboot. But refresh rate can be changed from Advanced Display Settings even when Fn + R stops working.

- Very rarely, trackpad can be a little annoying during gaming but easy enough to switch off.

- Not an issue, but an annoyance - some Lenovo advertisement for some performance services used to pop up in the first couple of weeks. Haven't noticed it recently.

- I still hit num lock instead of backspace after all these weeks :-)

Most issues are quite trivial and very manageable.

I still like this laptop very much and will keep the 5 stars."
487,1.0,Bought laptop from Amazon for first time. Got new one in good condition. Good for gaming. Using it for many months and have not faced any issues.
488,5.0,"Ok so this is a great gaming laptop no doubt...
Happy using this laptop since 1 week and I found that the battery life is not so great but it's ok like you cannot expect a good battery life with any gaming laptop.
Performance is just too good like it's hard to believe the performance it gives with the RtX 3060 gpu with the AMD ryzen 5800h cpu inside.
Recommended to play game while charging it as it will give you great performance. No problem with backlit keyboard in my unit and I think it's just the software issues many users are facing with keyboard.
Build quality is awesome and the body can get heated very much so be careful about that while gaming.
The QHD display with 165hz refresh rate is very nice and is so good to play games and watch movies on it.
The laptop and its charger combined are very bulky (3.5kgs) and not advised to carry around but it's ok...
You can buy this laptop without any doubt..
Overall it's worth it!"
489,5.0,"This is the best gaming performance I've had from a system ever. Moving from Nitro 5 to this has been a heavenly experience. Tried a few games, some GPU heavy and some CPU heavy and wasn't disappointed.

The only reason I'm reducing 1 star from this feedback is that there seems to be software issues with Lenovo's proprietary software that they themselves don't know what to do about.

Their inhouse software Lenovo Vantage which is supposed to be used to control everything about the laptop including the backlighting of the keyboard has some options missing from the ones they advertise online. My particular model doesn't have any option to modify or turn off the backlighting so now it is stuck in a flashy rainbow loop endlessly. Even though people who have received this laptop in other parts of the world haven't faced this issue, I've seen a couple of people reporting this problem in India and Lenovo support is completely clueless as to how this can be resolved

Edit: Dropping the review down to 1 star based purely on the experience with Legion 'Premium' Tech Support. Every time you call them they have the same response, they run the automatic diagnostic tool on the Lenovo website (which I did before even contacting them) and when that doesn't resolve the issue, they say they'll get back within a day and then there is no response. You need to keep calling for follow ups. After a week of having this laptop, five days out of which I have been on tech support calls for over an hour (including the hold) , their resolution is, ""We can't be bothered to check where this issue is coming from even though people have been reporting it for over a month now. We will not send a software patch to fix this issue. We can replace the device for you"". When I asked for the replacement they redirected me to Amazon and since it's out of stock on Amazon now, their only response is return the device and take your money back. Nobody wants to actually work towards finding a solution even though this has been present on Lenovo forums for quite some time now (Lenovo forums are as useless, in case anybody was wondering). Even though the laptop is amazing, and I considered just using it with the flashing rainbow in my face all the time, the way Lenovo has acted here tells me how they'll handle any other issues in case they arise in the future and it isn't very promising. Won't recommend."
490,5.0,"Initially thought that the 16"" laptop was a bit bulky, but it turned around to be much like any other 15.6"" laptop as the bezzels are so thin.

Those who are looking for a productive and gaming laptop, just go for it. The 16"" 165Hz QHD display is perfectly calibrated.

For the gamers, the thermals are quite stable and you will not hear the fans running unless and until you are playing graphic intensive games.

The sound quality is good. Thanks to the built-in application Nahimic which brings immersive sound experience to your speakers as well as external headphones or other output devices. Another main feature is that with this, you can connect to two bluetooth/plugged in headphones at the same time and the laptop stream sounds without any audio lag. There is also an additional option with the Nahimic app we can change the surrond sound, volume stabilizer, bass and treble and there are 5 profiles for the sound- music, movie, communication, gaming and smart. All the modes have very different characteristics.

I havn't tested the HDR and Dolby Vision but i am sure that it will do a great job with this gorgeous display.

Coming to the waranty part, you get three years of waranty which can be seen while taking Lenovo Vantage preintalled app and 13 months of Legion ultimate support. The screenshot has been attached with this review.

Will get 1 month of Xbox Game Pass and Microsoft Office home and student 2019 with this machine.

Will update further if I find anything else"
491,5.0,"Overall the best high end laptop you can buy in market. Only concern is of the touchpad which is very bad. I find it very difficult to use it to control mouse movements. I bought the laptop when it was Rs. 1.34L with some offers which reduced another 7K.

I believe it is not worth for 1.6L. If you can continue using old laptop till AMD brings new cpu which supports DDR 5. Or better look at new intel cpu which supports DDR5. DDR5 rams are very costly now but will eventually stabilise"
492,4.0,"Even after reading several negative views from customers, decided to trust, the brand, the seller and Am7azon. Received faulty laptop today morning. Display didn't start. Talked for an hour with Lenovo Customer Service. Who has promised an inspection and possible replacement...
Will update further developments...
So right now, only a star.

22/09/2021
Inspection was carried out by Amazon. As few reviews suggested, that out of stock pieces are refrred back to Amazon by Lenovo Customer Care, so decided to contact Amazon. Piece defective. As expected, no piece in stock, Amazon has promised retun and refund.
But waiting for pick up since 2 days. Nobody has turned up. Delaying my refund.
Since it was exchanged with old laptop, I am literally without any machine to work from home. Pathetic and insensitive, all those responsible for this farce.
Shall update further.
27/09/2021
Waiting for pickup since 21-26 6 days in row. Pickup is booked. Gets cancelled. Since last 6 days.
Tried to explain Amazon Customer care, which keeps on creating new Pickup everyday. Initially they did daily, since last 2 times they are creating pick up every alternate day.
Asked their agents, they say pick was cancelled by me.
Not able to understand:
1. Amazon says, I am cancelling pickup (of defaulted Lenovo Legion 5 Pro) while with every cancel, is backed by new pickup request. BTW, What I would do with faulty laptop, whichjust a piece of junk for me.
2. And why would I place an immediate request for pickup, after a failed puckup attempt, if I am cancelling pickup at my place.
C.C. executives understand but, are jus pawn, don't know how to solve it.
This is the routine for past 10 days.
Initially they promised me advance refund, then they continued with old story that I am cancelling the pickup.
The biggest culprit is seller, Appario Retail, who sold defective product. Brand Lenovo, is yet another bigger culprit, who doesn't have simplest quality control.
Well, tomorrow there is yet another pickup scheduled.
Amazon's internal system is being screwed by someone, insider. And management is clueless.
Shall update tomorrow with pickup details.

02/10/2021
Pickup didn't happen on 28th Sept 2021. But new twist happened. I was advised by a customer care representative to for replacement instead of return. I agreed. Replacement was to happen today. But......
The same reason of failed verification of old laptop, was not picked up, and replacement went back from my door. Customer care now says they can't replace, they will give me refund. Totally confused and feel helpless. Nothing that I can do except wait for another 72 hours after which pick up is arranged.
So now over to Tuesday 5th October 2021."
493,5.0,"Awesome. Works quite well. Loved the features. Has the latest generation tech as of today
It did have a problem with the Lenovo vantage (couldn't change lighting, battery settings, update software, etc). Had to update the bios manually for that after a support technician helped through the Lenovo community.
Would've liked per key lighting instead of 4 zone backlight for this price though.
One thing to note is the VRAM in the RTX 3060 is only 6gb. It's more than enough to play all games but some of the latest ones can't be played in ultra settings without stuttering and frame rate drop."
494,1.0,"Pre ordered and got it on 7th August.

Day-1 experience: started playing Doom Eternal.
Observations:
1) Very smooth gameplay and got that high definition gaming vala feeling.
2) Laptop build quality is Amazing and sturdy. Feels Premium.
3) This laptop comes with 6GB graphics - when set at suitable high end settings and played doom enternal - after a while fan noise increases (this is expected for high intense tasks) but did not feel much heat on the keyboard and game went very very smooth without any disturbance.
note: I played continuously for 2.5 to 3 hrs only
4) Laptop's Audio output is decent
5) The 720p Webcam is ok
6) Price- i am really not sure if this is high or reasonable compared to other gaming laptops. I personally like Lenovo.
(I have an ideapad bought in 2016 and it is still pretty much alive and not a single problem - so I built the trust from here)

Planning to play other games as well from Xbox game pass and will update the review or post a youtube video.

But as of day 1 : 5 stars and loved it!"
495,3.0,"Excellent Machine, Really good laptop from Lenovo. This is my 2nd Laptop also from Lenovo.
1st one was from 2012 the very initial flagship of Lenovo Y500 (those days Lenovo was only one competing Dell Alienware, also the better/only other option). It lasted 8 Years, only few hiccups in touch pad.

This really met my expectations from Lenovo, Creating build, size and quality. Remarkable sound quality and Display (16:10 is the best).
Got the laptop at a decent price (128k) even during the scarcity of laptops and video cards.

The 300W charger is hefty but, for this beast to run at its full potential with the 6GB RTX graphics its necessary. Could have a card reader port Thunder bolt charging."
496,5.0,"The legion 5 pro is. a beast
There are many reviews and utube reviews
i will keept it short
1. best cooling
2.sound is immense...its just awesome
3. display is qhd and bezel less...just feels heavenly while gaming or watching a movie because it had hdr+ certified
4. gpu is rtx 3060 130 tgp and it cam almost play any game ..i get 100+ fps in highest settings in gta V and the 165Hz refresh rate is just awesome if u are switching from 60 to 165
5. fps games are running so smooth..u will love it
6. 3 years warranty...XD WOW
Cons
1. since its a beast it consumes. a lot of power so yeah average battery life ..bcox 165Hz screen also consumes power so when you are not gaming u can switch on hybrid mode
2. could have been cheaper a bit but perfect at this price range
3. the vantage app is so odd and not much features are availble

Cons dont value much ..
just listen to this
Go for it...beacuse this is the best GAMING laptop
thank you"
497,5.0,"Lenovo Legion5 -PRO is highly recommended, its the only laptop worth buying for its price point, got mine delivered by amazon in 4 days, been using it for 2 weeks, comes with a surprise 3 year warranty by default.
the gaming performance is awesome , specially since it is the only laptop in India with a non crippled GPU . battery life in quiet mode is almost 6 hours, little lower than 8 hour advertised under ideal conditions.
if you want to buy a laptop primarily for gaming, go for it, the CPU and GPU are both non crippled, and as far as i know, its the only laptop with full 130W NVIDIA 3060 GPU .
and yes laptop is heavy ,great build quality , and heat is not an issue ,just don't keep it on your lap when gaming and you are fine."
498,5.0,"Gaming - You can't find better than it in the whole world within this price range!

Battery life - Oh!if your main focus is to get more and more battery life,then please stay away from it.

Content creation - It has a QHD panel(16:10) which comes with 100% sRGB.You can easily imagine about it's productivity.Just get it!

Value for money - Everything is best in it in this price range,except the 1Rx8 dual channel ram sticks(Still it is beating some of the rtx 3070 laptops with it's full powered rtx 3060 variants)

Verdict - If your main concern is gaming or productivity and you got the budget,blindly go for it.If you just want batterey life and lightweight laptop,then don't go for it,it's somewhat heavy.But I am also a college student and I didn't face any problem for it's weight still now."
499,5.0,"Top notch gaming performance and top notch display. Only issue is the camera, it is not good at all, even for a gaming laptop. Battery is like 2 hr with Rtx gpu and 165hz refresh rate on. Speaker is also okayish, not that great. If your focus is only gaming, then you can go for it blindly, don't need to think twice for it. I got it for 123k at Amazon Great Indian Sale. Even for 140k it is a stellar deal. Best gaming laptop in india atleast with 3 years of warranty."
500,5.0,"The laptop's built quality of top-notch and full metal alloy construction. Keyboards has good travel distance and no!!! There is no RGB lighting problem. Check attached pics.
I'm not gonna bore u with laptop details.
You also get 1 months x Box game pass subscription.
Laptop heats up during gaming, I would suggest using a cooling pad or an elevated stand it so that it can suck up more air and keeps the laptop cool.
Only disappointed because didn't get a free backpack which u would have otherwise gotten if ordered from Lenovo's website.
And the power brick is1 kg and in total is 3.5 kg with the laptop so portibility is not an option.
Overall superb laptop with great performance.
Can easily recommend.
Update:
The laptop comes with Intel wifi card not realtek. Check attached pic."
501,1.0,"Beast in gaming
The 130 watts 3060 will not disappoint
Able to run AAA title games at ultra easily
Raytracing is superb and the dlss makes game run smoother on Ray tracing
Can’t stress enough about the display
165hz 2k display most elegant in the market
Arguably best cooling system the coolfront3

Now the downsides
The battery is okay for gaming gives almost an hour for gaming
( For normal stuff there are 3 power modes and option to change display from 165hz to 60 for normal usage so this will give more then 3-4 hours )

The RGB lighting keyboard isn’t so great it’s very average"
502,5.0,You can't ask for anything better. A bit pricey but 0 complains.
503,5.0,"The Legion 5 Pro is an absolute beast of a computing machine! The thermals are excellent even in the scorching Indian summers, the 2560*1600 16:10 display with VESA certified HDR400 is a marvel to look at, and the build quality is as solid as it gets for a gaming laptop. The entire laptop has a metallic finish and feels solid to the touch. The rubber stands underneath the laptop are deep enough to allow for considerable airflow but I would recommend raising the back atleast a few inches during intense gaming sessions. The keyboard has a soft-touch finish to it and it is a pleasure to type on."
504,5.0,"Lenovo Legion 5 Pro fails to deliver on the PRO moniker. An expensive device costing 1.55 Lakhs has some unforgiving shortcomings and I had to spend ₹15000 more to rectify its serious hardware shortcomings.

1. Comes with a ULTRA CRAPPY MediaTek MT7921 Wifi 6 card. Seriously this card is worst in the world and my upload & download speeds went to 10 MBPS no matter what I did. Mind it I have a 200MBPS Airtel Xstream broadband. Had to spend ₹5000 to upgrade with an Intel AX210 wifi module.

2. It comes with SLOW single rank X16 RAM modules and I got upto 20% less performance in some games like Shadow of the Tomb Raider, Horizon zero dawn, COD Warzone etc. Had to spend ₹10000 for two X8 RAM sticks (2x8 GB).

3. Mobile RTX3060 is good but not future proof. Nvidea played cheap trick by limiting its VRAM to 6GB and that's why this graphic card is not enough to play many games in ultra textures as VRAM runs out (Watch dogs Legion, COD-Warzone etc.). Fore reference, the desktop version of 3060 come with 12GB VRAM.
4. Highly Overpriced. Lenovo is selling the 3060 gpu model in India at the price of 3070 model and on top of it comes with inferior RAM and Wifi.

Everything else is fine."
505,5.0,"Received the laptop today and it is as just as in the description i.e. just wonderful and amazing. The only thing is that delivery guy brought the package to me without the box from Amazon but it was sealed so accept it and Amazon must be careful from next as laptops are fragile so maximum protection is needed. Also, while buying the laptop from Amazon they didn't seems to send the bag as well which is a disadvantage means you need to purchase bag seperately overall there is no issues with the laptop or anything and if you need a gaming laptop just go for this one and won't regret it."
506,2.0,Display and built quality are the best of all which stands out with its competitors. I spent some time playing valorant at medium settings. The cpu temp goes to 75 degrees and GPU temp goes to 60 degrees. You will definitely notice a difference in the display. It's the best display a gaming laptop has.i didn't any fps drops.
507,2.0,"To all those interested in buying a lenovo laptop... Here's one you should read before you decide: DO NOT BUY THIS LAPTOP! THEY ARE TRYING TO SCAM YOU!!!
I'm a graphic designer, and I was looking for laptops in the range of rs 150000/-
I found the lenovo legion 5 pro among others, I decided to go for the lenovo because I have used a lenovo for years and I had a pretty likable experience in the past.
This has and will always be my biggest regrets; I made the mistake of buying the lenovo legion 5 pro AMD Ryzen 7, on the 5th of October 2021, it was delivered to me on the 10th, I bought the extended warranty, antivirus, my softwares and others, had them all installed on the laptop.
It worked smoothly for exactly 7 days, as if programmed with the last day of replacement of faulty product.
So on the 18th of October my laptop never came back on. It has been lying on my table dead to this day.
Apparently, with the lenovo legion, you get premium customer care, another spam, for namesake, they try to make you feel special but it's all a ruse, it's been a living hell talking to the premium customer care of lenovo legion, I speak to different people every time and have to explain my situation on each customer care call every day. Every call, all they say is ""please have patience, please wait for a few more days"" in 3 days I complete a month of having a dead laptop in my house, Lenovo refuses to let me go to the service station saying that it's not allowed, someone from their side has to come to my residence to evaluate my laptop. This is hasn't happened. On the 10th of November, it completed a month since I recieved the laptop from Amazon.
PLEASE PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS OR ANY OTHER LENOVO LAPTOPS!
IT WILL BE THE BIGGEST MISTAKE YOU MAKE!!! BEWARE!"

511,4.0,"Amazing performance, super smooth, great battery backup(note : after installing win11 the battery consumption increased it now only gives 3 hours of battery life or a bit more but if you are using on win11 always put it on power saving mode and use it, and on win10 it used to give around 6 hours of battery life)"

514,4.0,"I'd pre-ordered the laptop when it lauched and was super excited to check it out when it arrived before the specified date.

I was disappointed when i realized that the backlight controls were not working. No option to customize the lighting scheme too. A quick google search about the issue revealed that the problem was fairly common.

Tried updating the softwares, bios etc as suggested in the forums to no avail. Called lenovo customer care, was kept on hold for around 30 mins. I got fed up and disconnected. Finally i reached out to amazon support who scheduled a technician visit to decipher the issue. On the inspection day, the touchpad stopped working as well. The technician said that the problems could be due to some underlying hardware defects.

Initiated a refund immediately. Say what you want about how expensive apple products are, such QC issues rarely occur. Paying close to 1.4 lacs and encountering such issues is an absolute travesty."

This is a global issue with a lot of units. You can find the same issue on Lenevo website forums in detail. Few other buyers here on amazon mention the same issue as well.

I have initiated a return as I am not getting a replacement. Lenevo Ultimate Support is pathetic. You won't be able to reach out to them most of the time. I was lucky enough to get in touch with them and their customer guy gave a wrong e-mail id for communication.

Buy this laptop if you can live with the faulty RGV keyboard. Otherwise, this is a beast laptop."

This laptop comes with a 3 months xbox membership, 3 years warranty and 1 year of premium support.

I compared with Alienware, Zyphrus and Rager blade. TUF (Asus) and Nitro (Acer) series doesn't even stand nearby....

It has one of the best screen.... 500 nits and 100% colour accuracy and 165 htz display is something which gives an advantage during gaming.

532,5.0,"I upgraded from a Macbook Pro 2018 Touchbar model. My reason was simple. Big Sur was lasting me barely 4 hours and my keyboard was giving me trouble. I still havent managed to sell that model but I'm sure I will soon. Anyway, I have used this long enough to know what I like about this and what i dont like. I think most things will be fairly obvious and my review is one that is ideal for someone who is well versed with the Macbook Universe. This is my 5th Macbook and the first new one I have purchased since the 2015 model. Usually I buy used models and they seem to run fine. But this time the price and the value proposition and the fact that there was very little difference between the used and new price made me buy this on a 3 month emi.

Pros of m1 macbook pro -
a) BATTERY A+ I love not having to charge this macbook. If I charge it to 100% on a Friday Evening and use it at night for 2-3 horus, use it on all of Saturday for 3-4 hours and use it for 2 hours on Sunday, I will probably be left with about 30% battery. That is a big deal. But Apple is not without blame as they keep giving less battery with newer Mac OS. I will talk of that later. Of course if you have brightness on full blast and are doing video converting the battery life may just be 8 hours but I can guarantee at least 10 hours screen on time doing whatever you want. I charge my Macbook once it reaches low levels. So far I have used 18 cycles and the battery is still at original 100% capacity. I expect it deteroirate to 90% in one year and maybe down to 81% after 24 months. I will update you i promise.

b) Display - The display has improved from 2018 model. It is brighter, sharper, youtube videos and MacOS looks almost perfect on this display. Since there is a lockdown I havent taken it out much but it definitely lesser reflective than the 2018 version so that is a good job.

c) Keyboard - I liked the 2018 keyboard but after 45 days of using it when I use the other keyboard, I feel that this is so much more enabling. The keystrokes are good. It took me 7 days to get used to this keyboard but now I am happy they made this transition. All keys are working very well.

d) Power - When I use this to convert a video file, it usually gets done in about 240 seconds. The max time it ever takes on FCP is like ten minutes. It is obviously faster on opening tabs and the basic but yes the power is good.

e) No Heat - My 2018 used to get very hot but the M1 Macbook Pro is always cool. I keep this on my stomach when I am lying down and it never warms up. I have heard the fans operate just 1-2 times in 45 days of owning this. So thats a major plus and something you should not take for granted. Heat is the biggest enemy of battery life.

f) Improved HD camera - its gone from a 4/10 to a 6.5/10 and apple still needs to improve.

g) At Rs 1,17,000 i think this is worth the price. You can keep this computer for at least 3 years and sell it for about 50% of the price which is acceptable to me at least.

h) The touchbar surface is a little more raised and not flush like the 2018 model. This makes for better use. Also the touch id button is better to the touch. This is a good imrpovement.

i) The trackpad remains best in class. Fun to use.

CONS

a) SCREEN gets dirty, smudged up after use. This is really sad. I bought some equipment from amazon to wipe screen but they are not helping. No matter what you do - the screen will get ugly and have marks over time.
b) 2 usb c ports are not good enough as when placed next to one another they are often difficult to use. Also now I can;'t always use my charger as its easy to reach only on right hand side but not the left hand side. So like now when I am typing, the macbook is on battery. These guys should give one usb c port each side.
c) The sound is about 80% as loud as the 2018 Macbook Pro. They have made it a little quieter. This is not acceptable apple.
d) MacOS next generation will again kill its battery performance. I can't believe Apple made me upgrade to a new computer by slowing down the older Macbook. This is bad business.
e) Mail app has become poor and also I am noticing the Macbook is never indexed properly. So for example, Mail will take a lot of processing power but not give results. I have just 4 accounts linked and think this is not acceptable. Gmail website performs way better than apple inbuilt email.
f) Apple ends up taking gb of data in cache and 70% users dont know how you have to get rid of it. Every apple user has to buy clean my mac. why can't apple itself become better on this front?
g) I need a camera as good as my iphone and this is nowhere near.

CONCLUSION - This machine is worth the asking price. I am leaving 4 stars for now and will update in six months time.

If this is your first macbook, you will fall in love with Apple again.
If you are upgrading from a recent macbook, you need to read this review again.
If you are stuck on a 2015 or older machine, just buy this."
533,5.0,Battery life is good screen is good
534,2.0,The best thing I’ve ever bought. Worth every penny
535,5.0,"Been using it almost two weeks.

I'm removing 2 stars due to the following issues:
1. Wifi is intermittent despite of being near a 6 antenna asus wifi 6 router! This is unforgivable.
2. SSD soldered onto board, this is really bad new because I used a macbook pro for 7 years before this, one of the good top of the line models before they went touch bar etc, after a battery upgrade it's SSD died, and turns it it was a transitionary model and thus no off the shelf replacement is available. Now with the SSD fixed on this new model, and SSDs having a finite write cycle count, with the current swap file usage, it will render the machine dead prematurely.
3. Terrible keyboard.
4. GPU, the good, it's fairly capable but it can't drive the high pixel count like a dedicated power guzzling GPU, still very commendable for it's power consumption.

Should I return the machine or got through the hassle of going to an apple care facility to get the wifi issue sorted out, I'm not confident they will even sort it out with it being intermittent. For this kind of money, ouch! Yet to decide.

I've succumbed and using my monitor's wired network via TB4.

The pros of this machine:
1. battery life, nothing comes close to apple silicon.
2. macos, love it, hate it. For a developer it's fantastic, though windows has come a long with WSL2, still this beats if for it's bsd-ish backbone.
3. touchpad, best you can buy.
4. speed, with all it's m1 max and shared fast ram, formidable.
5. quick charging & magsafe port.
6. excellent screen, hdr at 1600 nits is quite something. high contrast, not sure about its colour accuracy.
7. seems well build, time will tell.

This is a tool, if it pays for itself, it's worth it, as a portable with great battery life and performance, it's hard to beat. The main thing is the batter life for me. YMMV.

Thumbs up."
536,4.0,Good
537,1.0,"This is my first Macbook ever and I can already feel the power, os optimization and speed etc. Even My 9th gen i9 with 32gb ddr4 ram with rtx 3090 cant beat it in video production, editing, rendering specially playing my Canon R5 4k 8k c-log 3 videos so smooth without a single frame drop which my desktop couldn't dream of. Amazing apple hats off to you. Though you can't gaming like my desktop would but it's not meant to. If you do creative works like video production editing and all then definitely you can go for it rather investing huge amount on a desktop wich cant reach half performance like it. Full 5 stars. I bought it from Amazon authorized seller so no worries of any quality issue."
538,5.0,"Best offer ever got from Amazon. With exchange of my old laptop and bank discount Apple macbook pro ( M1 chip 2020 ) got for just 80k.
Quality of laptop is superb with high performance speed and ram management that what apple product famous for.
Batter life is awesome on M1 SoC, got 4 days without charge tunning daily for 5hrs with coding and surfing stuff. Standby without charging goes for more than 15 days to get all battery drain"
539,5.0,"I've been using it for 3 days now. I have a high performance workflow and this compact laptop has been able to handle all of my tasks without any hindrances. I don't know why people don't like touchbar, it helps in so many ways. It's battery life is awesome. For light workflows it can easily last for 2 days without a doubt. It's got one of the best laptop display, speakers and trackpad.

I'll give an overview of what I use in this, I have 2 development servers running with 20 safari / brave browser tabs, I have some apps open like Slack, Notion, VS Code and along with all this I have Windows vm running with its own set of 2-3 more softwares. I've faced no lag or stuttering or whatsoever.

544,1.0,"I must say - if you are looking for something Amazing then this product is for you.

I was former user of Mackbook Pro and I was thinking, to change my old system due to new business standards but I was little hesitate in purchasing the Pro version due to its high cost.

But when I started looking at the performance as well as the advance features of this Laptop, I fell in love with them and I am sure, if you are looking for the change in your system then Pro is the right choice for you :)"
545,3.0,I have order a 16-inch Macbook Pro with M1 Max processor on 23rd June. Received a genuine laptop on 24th June. Bought it through Appario Retail Private Ltd. The manufacturing month of the laptop is June 2022. The serial number on the invoice and laptop checks out too.
546,5.0,"Being a dedicated Apple user since 2011, there really was no ""selling"" required for me to make this decision. My primary machine was a 3.5 year old Dell Inspiron 2-in-1 that server me well and through more than normal usage. It survived rigorous pic/video editing, live-streaming and other multimedia heavy activities but had gotten worn down. Simply because it was the best fit for those kinds of jobs.
I've always wanted to switch to a Mac but was held back due to budget limits. This time I was in the market and the windows configuration that I was looking for was also in the 90-95 k range. So it really wasn't too much of a stretch to go for a Mac (Finally).
Ok, enough of the back story and on to the review. The Mac is really an artist's tool. It is loaded with so many cool features (although it is also annoying that apple decides to remove some of the useful features on a whim - such as the MagSafe charger).
I've used this for a month now and have been actively editing and posting content on my YouTube channel using the tools build in. Quite frankly its a breeze.
One may not notice any huge difference when using email, browsing the net or working on office apps - to the extent of even thinking what's the big fuss all about? But the real power of the Mac shows when you're doing video renders of your edited content. That's where it really tells you that its money well spent.
Oh, the battery life is just monstrous. I charge it only every other day. I don't need to connect a charger every day. That is something Ive never experienced on any windows machine.
If you have the money, GO for it!"
547,5.0,"As an avid Apple fan, I was really excited to get this M1 MacBook Pro as my first ever Mac. And going a few weeks using it, it definitely lives up to its reputation! I have the 512gb SSD 8gb RAM configuration.
Battery: It sips battery life and I can easily last a day of extensive graphic designing and editing and a few hours worth of calls and still have a little below 50% left!
Ecosystem: I already had an iPhone and an iPad and getting another Apple device just adds into the ecosystem. I can receive calls, transfer documents and carry over my work from one device to another!
Performance: This MBP boasts power. Most apps open instantly from Chrome to Adobe Premiere Pro and it handles tasks like a beast! It has a gorgeous display perfect for color accurate work and has loud, extremely good speakers. Attending calls and multitasking is super intuitive and with macOS Big Sur the whole system is snappy. It’s so good, that I almost never shut it down, it instantly wakes up from sleep and I’m ready to get going!
Really there are only some minor inconveniences here: There are only two Thunderbolt ports and a headphone jack. That is a limitation at times.
It’s a bit heavy at 1.4kg but if most of your work is mostly desk orientated, then it shouldn’t be a problem.
Another “issue” is the app compatibility thing with M1. Since these Macs are now ARM based and not x64 like their Intel counterparts, you may run into some silly stuff occasionally. But that’s part of the process. I’d suggest you check in advance if your favorite and essential apps are working with these Silicon macs.
Overall, anyone looking to upgrade their experience to a whole new level, look no further!
I have been loving this machine so much that I doubt that I’m ever returning back to Windows!"
548,5.0,I am extremely satisfied with what has been received.
549,5.0,"Upgraded to this machine from macbook pro mid 2012 although it was still nice and working but this one is super fast in terms of performance and super quite on mid2012 a slight noise of hard disk was always audible but ssd is a thing for this decade.!

Switching from 500gb HDD on older mac to 256 gb ssd. A but compromise on storage but who cares those extra space we dont need much space for keeping movies now and 256 is manageable.

I do like the new keyboard.. everyone keep saying that butterfly keyboard was a hell for macs before 2020 but i did not got the lucky chance to type on a butterfly. People are also saying that this is most advance and improved keyboard on mac well it might be but i liked the old style chiclet keyboard much better than any other modern mac keyboard. It was classy although i will get used to it and forget about the experience of old chiclet

Also i got rid of my last device that can run compact disks sooner or later this was going to happen but i feel sorry for those disc that are still lying in my cupboard
At last this device is a great thing to have in 2021 and beyond if you are a mac os lover and want a product to be with you for atleast 5 years.
M1 is a new era and its time to bid adeu to intel P.S it was nice to have you with us till now but its time to get rid of you no more intel inside
Overall for more better review there are videos on internet. I am just sharing my experiences of new macbook pro M1 as compared to my old mac"
550,5.0,"I bought a 512 GB / 8 GB MAC model (Space Grey) Macbook Pro M1. Great product, faster than many MAC models. Front camera though looks blurry in medium/low light and that is a total disappointment when you are spending a huge amount on Apple devices. It is so blurry even your 2013 Mac model would look better in front of it. Battery life though is really good and Apple's tall claims of 20 hours of battery life are pretty much good. The only problem is they are using a simulator Rosetta for lot of applications which may or may not be simulating it perfectly. I haven't found a problem as of now but read a lot of reviews on YouTube. Not tested the gaming environment for now, so no comments on that. I would recommend to wait for some new MAC model with improvements to the M1 chip.

Also, I recently bought this and I'm pretty new to exploring the MAC environment myself, Amazon did put a price drop on this within a week and now they do not agree to match the price. Really sad when you buy products like these and the price drop and they are not ready to match it, instead they suggest to place another order and return the existing order which I think is downright insane.

Overall product is fine though, if not for Amazon sucky price match policy. Disappointed with Amazon though on this part."
551,1.0,"This piece of machine has handled much more bizarre tasks than I had ever been able to do on any machine. There are people who say you could have bought something with much more better specs so why chose mac.
Lets enlist them.
Speakers quality is good.
I go on 1 day straight without charging it, sometimes I even forget my charger at home.
Machine learning models, 3d models slicing, programming everything just works flawless hanks to Rosetta.
Ultralight and compact design.
I guess there are many more reasons to go for it."

554,5.0,"Magnificent, but had to return. M1 is a game-changer. I ran 4 4K videos from youtube ( connected external display) In parallel, a teams meeting call, and a fully loaded python IDe(spyder from anaconda). Did above for 30 mins. It managed it with 6GB RAM and 1GB swap. Didn't hear up, didn't hear the fans either. No lags anywhere.
Problem: though it claims 720p which is standard across most laptops, the video quality was sub par, and very grainy. Amazon helped replace this but the replacement was none better. Hence returned. I didn't try FaceTime or any other app, if Video was not clear on teams call, it is blocker for me.
Other than this, I strongly vouch for this. Since it didn't get heated up on my stress test(even my dell - i7 with 16gb, doesn't land smooth on the test) , I think even the cheaper Macbook Air M1 can be given a try.
I bought macmini same specs from apple store itself, since I needed badly and they were delivering next day. Luckily it has ports to handle my spare peripherals . Macbook comes with only 2 thunderbolt ports , which includes charge port. You'd invariably need to invest in hubs/adaptors."
555,5.0,"Battery life : not able to kill it in a day even after intensive work ( including editing in final cut pro )

Thickness: weight management is perfect, not at all bulky. Its a very powerful and light machine

Ram management:
Just perfect. 8gb is sufficient. I am able to open around 60 to 90 tabs in safari plus final cut pro plus Microsoft word, excel and using side car with ipad all at once and not even a single lag or drop its butter smooth.

Performance in editing:
Editing 8k videos HDR content in final cut pro. Butter smooth editing experience even in best quality mode.
Only render time suffers during exporting HDR 4k video file.
If you are exporting no HDR file then rendering and exporting is hyper fast.
So M1 chip is really making everything seems so fluid and fast.

Comparison with other laptops:

This laptop has spoiled me.
I tried to go back to windows for a work but made me realise as if i am using some old machine from past. ( windows laptop that i was using was also launched this year with latest specifications)

Final conclusion:

If you do lots of editing
Go for Pro model if your budget allows

Dont stretch your budget if you can afford macbook air M1

Only if you need consistent high performance for prolonged period then buy this pro model else go with macbook air model
Both are equally powerful.

Cons:

Less ports
Thats it."
556,2.0,"I switched from Windows to macos in recent times and here is my review:
-not an easy task to get adjusted, takes time but worth it
-battery is amazing
-I do coding everyday and performance is way better than Windows, on screen time is 2 3 days for me with battery
-camera could have been better with 1080p but you can't expect more with this price
-touch pad works well, doesn't affect your woek style
-without Google search it is highly impossible at the beginning to work with mac but once you're familiar it's worth it

Summary : great buy, amazon did fulfill the needs got it for reduced amount with all the offer, if you're looking for a coding laptop this is the one"
557,2.0,"It's a good laptop with good performance
But performance is not as hipe created,
Slow performance with Microsoft apps eg:Excel,word etc"
558,1.0,"I purchased without knowing that Boot Camp won’t work in M1 Chip. Little disappointed for not able to install Windows.

Overall the the product is value for money"
559,4.0,"The best thing about Mac book with M1 is its battery. 16 hours minimum backup.
Had some issues with the charging speed in the beginning. But then I figured out that it is because of the subzero temperature of Kashmir that the macbook is exposed to. If anyone else faces such problem don't panic, just warm the machine up a bit by giving some heat, the charging speed will return to normal.
However, Apple Inc, selling its products at such high prices with great customer expectations should fix this issue and should make the macbooks battery system more potent in order for it to withstand the subzero temperatures."
560,4.0,"I am relatively new to the apple Ecosystem. MacBook Pro was the final device that completed it. all these devices are so well integrated that sometimes I forget if its my iPad my phone or my MacBook. I am really enjoying it.
TBH I am not a heavy user. I browse I study and do pretty basic stuff on it. its been a joyful experience, though. there is zero lag. my tactile senses are overwhelmed by the feel of the keyboard and the touchpad.
THE BATTERY IS A BEAST!!!! I last charged it to a 100% on the 27th of June and used it for about 2 to 3 hours everyday. I am still sitting at 22%. and that will carry me easily to Monday.
THE SPEAKERS ROAR!! mind you this is a laptop after all.

so for everyone out there who doesn't have a MacBook, wants a MacBook and can afford a MacBook.. please go for it. YES IT IS EXPENSIVE, no joke. and one can argue that there are comparable laptops out there but its an experience like none other I can tell you that."
561,4.0,"I was looking to upgrade from my MBP 2015, But I had no reasons too. Apple was still using intel i5's, also I really did not like the keyboard made after 2015. IMHO, 2015 was the last great MacBook Apple made. But fast forward to 2020, Apple did it's magic, no more Intel's (RIP) no more butterfly keyboards. It was my time to officially retire my trusty workhorse.
I was waiting for M1X, M2 but since it did not happen, I went with M1. What should I say? Reviews are real this is the future of chips. It's redundant, but when Apple decides to do something, they do it right and this what this beast is.
Everything is top notch, the keyboard, microphone, webcam, software compatibility. This machine checks every single checkmark.
If you are into creative work/developer get this machine, you will thank yourself.
I did not go with Air since, I'm developer and I work large projects which take sometime to compile. I did not want to take any risks so I went with MacBook with a fan.
Once you go Mac, you'll never go back."
562,5.0,"I was tracking for the best deal to buy the MacBook Pro for quite sometime. I was lucky to get it at a very reasonable price.

MacBook pro is our go to device for all things work so I have no comments about its features and performance as it's the best the money can buy."
563,2.0,Highly recommended
564,4.0,"I am IT professional so I am giving the feedback accordingly. Mostly working in DevOps tools.

If you try to install github cli , you may face challenges. Clipgrab doesn’t work to download youtube videos but YouTube-dl command line works.
Some softwares you need to run Xcode —install again. If you install it once but next time you are going to install another software , you may need to run the xcode command.

1. Happy to purchase the product.
2. Amazon deliver the product on time.
3. Battery life far better as they mentioned
4. Power and speed I would not comment because I am not playing any games but boot up and shutdown is extremely fast
5. Sound is better then previous Mac.
6. Touch pad/bar is extremely cool, slight touch works but rarely require to use it , it’s just few days attractions.
7. Bluetooth and Wifi connectivity is better."
565,5.0,I love the touch bar feature and the M1 chip is really fast. Battery lasts one full day at around 10 hours of work.

567,3.0,"It's a good macbook. I expected the new M1 chip to be something unique, but it's nice. It's been a month since I bought and there have been issues like black screen, printer setup issues, machine getting slightly warmer (claim is excellent cooling but it sometimes doesn't work well), screen tends to attract lot of dust. All in all, it's a good buy but what one expects from Apple is way more :-)"
568,4.0,"It is a great computer (M1 MacBook Pro 512GB SSD), although I personally the speakers though are far better on the intel MacBook Pro. The M1 mac is comparitively faster and battery backup is much better than the intel MacBook Pro. There are some compatibility issues, due to it being a Apple Silicon chip, not all apps are supported, for which you would require to download Rosetta. I was hesitant on buying such a costly computer from Amazon, seeing some of the reviews, but I was pleasantly surprised, Amazon did a great job in delivering the package on time, even in this pandemic, the package was in perfect order. Great job Amazon 👍"
569,5.0," I have used a Mac since last 2 weeks. I have realized that my decision to shift to mac from Windows was very satisfying.
Very stable OS. I was very skeptic about my decision about shifting to mac. But now I feel that my decision was right.
There are so many negative reviews in the market about mac that we have to use only licensed softwares and all but believe me you can use free applications also to serve your different purposes of office work."
570,5.0,"The M1 chip has its flaws! As any ""new"" thing in the market, sometimes there are bugs that nobody can fix because it is a ""new thing"". 🐛
And: it is not as fast as they advertise.
Anyway, overall, a Mac is a Mac, and it is an excellent product."
571,4.0,"Excellent screen quality, Better battery life. Lags when you are copying data to a external Hard disk and also when you are importing photos from your iphone. For the rest, be assured, apple will not let u down. Apple has made this machine to give you different experience than other laptops. RAM could have been more, lagging is the result of that much short memory."
572,5.0,"Apple really went all out with this M1 Macbook Pro.

Its way more powerful than i5 for sure. Go for it and those worried about 8GB Ram. I have been using it for a week for Mobile App development and it runs very smoothly even with simulators and XCode. No issues at all.

The only issue I can think of is that Apple didn't provide a chip with more Graphic power compared to the Macbook Air. Not that the GPU is bad by itself but very few people would really need this Pro model over the Air. It does have the touch bar and much better Sound and a fan for prolonged heavy usage.
Also the apps are ready for M1 so don't worry about incompatibility either. Most apps work Native or some unupdated ones with Rosetta 2."
573,5.0,Battery doesn't hold up as much as promised but better than the rest. Screen is very fragile and prone to losing its functioning and a good cover is a must immediately.
574,5.0,good performance
575,4.0,"I’m a web developer
I used in 1 week and feel this is very good product
I got it at 1.6 lakh"
576,5.0,"If you've been using an Intel chip-based MacBook for now then I highly recommend you switch to Apple Silicon because these are faster. There is a short-term problem which is the compatibility of certain software but it should not be a reason for not buying an M1 chip-based MacBook. If there is only one software or a few software that your work on and they are yet not fully compatible on M1 then only I will recommend waiting. These machines are quieter, faster, powerful but lack support on some common software. But that is not a problem because constant work is happening on all these software to make it compatible with the M1 and M2 chips (to be announced later this year)."
577,5.0,It's best product ever
578,5.0,Product is undoubtedly good. But if you are a developer and you run apps like android studio and Xcode then consider 16gb ram. 8 gb ram is sometimes not sufficient and it is not upgradable. Also with new os updates apple products seem to become slower so more ram will be helpful to maintain speed in future.

I bought this from the offline Dell Store, and was able to crack hell of a deal.
First thing first, the machine costed me 1.20 lacs (which is way more cheaper than the online market and in fact the Dell online site says 1.43 lacs currently
With the laptop the store guys gave me, a Dell wireless keyboard and mice combo, a dell bag, a 64 gig pen drive & a sleeve :-) what else i could ask for (another free laptop may be!)
As far as the performance of the machine is concerned, it is very much curated in my subject line, and do note that im a macbook pro user from last 8 years!

Honestly, I won't recommend Macbook M1 at least in its first iteration and the fact that most of the apps still don't run as expected is frustrating.
Also, I can't rule out the fact that the Dell XPS in India comes at a premium (Interestingly Macbooks comes at a premium too if you compare it with the US pricing) but because Dell is not offering the Lowest end XPS in India (i3 model) the starting price of the XPS line is at a steep 1.5 lac.
To sum it up, I would recommend it to anyone who's got the budget because it's one hell of a beautifully crafted machine with the reliability of the tried and tested windows and because Dell nailed it with the XPS in terms of aesthetics and the modular design. It's definitely the easiest to carry laptop in the market currently."

620,1.0,"At features and price, this is a good laptop. The screen quality is decent and the setup is convenient. This is running Celeron, so obviously there's no gaming for this machine. It's unfortunate, but that three month game pass is pretty much useless. MS Office setup is easy and straightforward.

There are a few negatives. First, the wire going from the laptop to the screen is very visible at the hinge. This is a potential point of failure and I think it will affect the life of the laptop.

Another annoying aspect is the continuous upselling attempts by Lenovo. The laptop includes Lenovo Vantage software, which could be necessary for some aspects like firmware updates. However, Lenovo keeps pushing users to buy additional software coverage, including by throwing popups on the screen while you work.

Some annoying issues, but I think it's overall a good laptop."

622,5.0," Laptop is good interms of speed because of SSD and 8Gb ram. All applications runs smooth without Lag
Its lightweight very light and comfortable to hold and the design is good

But for me the worst part is display. Its not even HD screen for 28k cost and the worst is its TN panel, because of TN panel i get worst viewing angle. Even if i sit right in front and tilt the screen i see white glare in on screen. The TN panel plus the non HD screen makes a good combination for giving you a worst display. If u work on such display for long you will get headaches.

I think Lenovo giving so cheap display in 28k product is not done."

666,1.0," Pros:
1.Good laptop within this price range.
2.15.6 inch screen with antiglare feature.
3.Comes with MS Office installed.

Cons:
1.Sound quality is normal.
2.Web cam quality is normal.
3.No lights feature for keys.

Final Suggestion:

You can for it if you are looking for decent laptop for 25k range after all the discounts."
667,5.0,"At features and price, this is a good laptop. The screen quality is decent and the setup is convenient. This is running Celeron, so obviously there's no gaming for this machine. It's unfortunate, but that three month game pass is pretty much useless. MS Office setup is easy and straightforward.

There are a few negatives. First, the wire going from the laptop to the screen is very visible at the hinge. This is a potential point of failure and I think it will affect the life of the laptop.

Another annoying aspect is the continuous upselling attempts by Lenovo. The laptop includes Lenovo Vantage software, which could be necessary for some aspects like firmware updates. However, Lenovo keeps pushing users to buy additional software coverage, including by throwing popups on the screen while you work.

Some annoying issues, but I think it's overall a good laptop."
668,5.0,so far have purchase 2 pcs and willing to purchase more in future for familys and friends.
669,1.0," Laptop is good interms of speed because of SSD and 8Gb ram. All applications runs smooth without Lag
Its lightweight very light and comfortable to hold and the design is good

But for me the worst part is display. Its not even HD screen for 28k cost and the worst is its TN panel, because of TN panel i get worst viewing angle. Even if i sit right in front and tilt the screen i see white glare in on screen. The TN panel plus the non HD screen makes a good combination for giving you a worst display. If u work on such display for long you will get headaches.

I think Lenovo giving so cheap display in 28k product is not done."

804,5.0,"Il pc è buono, funzionante e idoneo per la navigazione, smartworking, contenuti in streaming e quant'altro, il prezzo è il più basso che abbia scovato, per un computer dotato di display a 15,6"" e hd ssd a 256 Gb, sebbene con risoluzione Hd, altrimenti bisogna ricorrere a dispositivi con schermo inferiore e con minore capacità dell'hard disk, per un importo simile. Attenzione: il prodotto, come riportato correttamente nel titolo, è Freedos, vale a dire privo di sistema operativo, pertanto occorre installarlo per conto proprio, ma per me non è stato affatto un dramma. Come descritto, non ha l'attacco LAN (RJ45), ma si risolve reperendo un adattatore Usb-Ethernet. Limite riscontrato: la memoria Ram di 4 Gb non reputo sia espandibile, accontentatevi, ho sbirciato qua e là su internet per averne la conferma che mi è stata data da più fonti, pertanto non è possibile ampliarla a 8 Gb o più, sarebbe stato opportuno evidenziarlo nella descrizione, ma non è mia volontà colpevolizzare nessuno, comunque il prezzo è assai conveniente ed inoltre utilizzerei tale dispositivo come muletto/pc di scorta. Per questo motivo ho assegnato 4 stelle. Un'ultima nota: il notebook, alludo a quello mio acquistato, dopo l'installazione di Windows 10, si accendeva automaticamente non appena si sollevava il coperchio, senza che fosse necessario premere il pulsante Power. Se tale modalità non vi andasse a genio, come a me del resto, è sufficiente recarsi nel Bios digitando ripetutamente il tasto F2 all'avvio del pc, accedere al menù ""Configuration"" e disabilitare la funzione ""Flip to Boot"", in tal modo il computer si accenderà in maniera tradizionale tramite l'apposito pulsante. Ciò è dovuto al fatto che i notebook più recenti hanno questa particolare funzione già preimpostata. Un grazie al venditore per la tempestività della spedizione nonchè ai corrieri Amazon."

Dentro la scatola troverete solo il PC e il caricabatteria più un paio di manuali di istruzioni, tra cui uno su come installare il sistema operativo (sì, il PC è freedos e tocca a voi installarlo). Io ho scelto di installare Windows 11 pro comprando una chiave di attivazione a poco più di 10 euro su internet e il PC si comporta bene, credo anche merito anche dell' SSD. Se cercate un notebook per giocare cambiate categoria, questo notebook non fa per voi. È un computer fatto per fare il minimo e quel minimo lo fa bene.

884,5.0,"Il pc è buono, funzionante e idoneo per la navigazione, smartworking, contenuti in streaming e quant'altro, il prezzo è il più basso che abbia scovato, per un computer dotato di display a 15,6"" e hd ssd a 256 Gb, sebbene con risoluzione Hd, altrimenti bisogna ricorrere a dispositivi con schermo inferiore e con minore capacità dell'hard disk, per un importo simile. Attenzione: il prodotto, come riportato correttamente nel titolo, è Freedos, vale a dire privo di sistema operativo, pertanto occorre installarlo per conto proprio, ma per me non è stato affatto un dramma. Come descritto, non ha l'attacco LAN (RJ45), ma si risolve reperendo un adattatore Usb-Ethernet. Limite riscontrato: la memoria Ram di 4 Gb non reputo sia espandibile, accontentatevi, ho sbirciato qua e là su internet per averne la conferma che mi è stata data da più fonti, pertanto non è possibile ampliarla a 8 Gb o più, sarebbe stato opportuno evidenziarlo nella descrizione, ma non è mia volontà colpevolizzare nessuno, comunque il prezzo è assai conveniente ed inoltre utilizzerei tale dispositivo come muletto/pc di scorta. Per questo motivo ho assegnato 4 stelle. Un'ultima nota: il notebook, alludo a quello mio acquistato, dopo l'installazione di Windows 10, si accendeva automaticamente non appena si sollevava il coperchio, senza che fosse necessario premere il pulsante Power. Se tale modalità non vi andasse a genio, come a me del resto, è sufficiente recarsi nel Bios digitando ripetutamente il tasto F2 all'avvio del pc, accedere al menù ""Configuration"" e disabilitare la funzione ""Flip to Boot"", in tal modo il computer si accenderà in maniera tradizionale tramite l'apposito pulsante. Ciò è dovuto al fatto che i notebook più recenti hanno questa particolare funzione già preimpostata. Un grazie al venditore per la tempestività della spedizione nonchè ai corrieri Amazon."

Io ho scelto di installare Windows 11 pro comprando una chiave di attivazione a poco più di 10 euro su internet e il PC si comporta bene, credo anche merito anche dell' SSD.

961,5.0,"I'm writing this review after about 4 months of usage, so it's based on a mixture of the purchase criteria/comparisons and actual usage. I wanted a no-frills laptop which was powerful but inexpensive. I looked at the Dells and Lenovos within the sub-60k price range but finally settled on this. Two and a half months later, no regrets.

You need to be clear what you want and what you’re getting because this config won’t satisfy everyone. Given below are my criteria for choosing this and a comparison of how this fares against the others I looked at.

CPU – Wanted an 11th gen i5 and this one has an i5-11300H – not G – so it has adequate power for the next few years.

RAM – I wanted either upgradeable 8GB RAM with a free slot or on-board 16GB. Through the years, my experience has been that buying a budget config laptop and doubling its RAM after a year or two really extends its life. Today, that means buying 8GB and upgrading to 16 later. Well, this one has 16GB out of the box so it should last a few years.

Graphics card – This doesn’t have an external NVIDIA card. So if you’re editing videos, playing graphics-intensive games or programming neural nets, then don’t go for this.

Touchscreen – Didn’t want to spend money on this. I’m fine with a good quality trackpad. If you want a touchscreen, you’ve got to either raise your price point or compromise on something else (RAM, screen quality etc) at this price point.

Screen Brightness - I wanted a screen bright enough to work outdoors in the afternoon and pretty much everything from the standard brands fell short on this front. My reading of the market (as of June 2022) is that you have to spend 80-90k+ on the more standard brands to get that kind of screen. But I’ve used this laptop outdoors in the afternoon quite often and there’s no issues, even on a bright afternoon.

Screen Resolution, Clarity, Contrast, Viewing Angles etc – Let’s be clear, this is not an OLED screen. You want the best of those, go for an ASUS. But it is high res and sharp. Viewing angles are great and so are colours. The best feature is that this screen has matte finish. None of those irritating ambient reflections in sunlight which a clear glossy screen is prey to. If you want to sit outdoors and work (browsing , editing, spreadsheets, presentations, coding etc), this is a great screen. What it is not great for is watching movies. Nothing like a clean, glossy OLED screen with muted ambient lighting for watching Netflix.

Sound – It’s adequate but nothing great to write home about. As I said, this laptop is not your best choice for media consumption.

Ports – My laptop is normally plugged into a monitor, keyboard, mouse, power and speakers at my desk. As a result, it’s a bit of a pain to unplug and reattach so many cables every time. Which is why I was keen on Thunderbolt 4. The thought of simply unplugging one wire and walking off with the laptop was very attractive. A good USB 4 hub is expensive, so I haven’t bought one yet, but it’s no.1 on my to-buy list. Many brands seem to think that Thunderbolt 4 is a premium feature, meant only for laptops which cost 80k+. For a non-premium guy like me it’s fortunate that Xiaomi included it in this laptop.

Looks and Durability – It’s an all metal body which looks sleek. As for durability, the metal body should prevent damage from minor falls. But the least durable parts of a laptop are the trackpad and the hinges – and I have no way of telling whether these will last or not. So no idea about this.

All in all, if you’re looking for a portable, inexpensive (I got this for 55k with exchange), laptop for work and regular use, this was the best available in June 2022 at this price point. You can use it in your balcony/garden, plug it back in very conveniently at your desk and the config should last 3-4 years easily. But if you’re a teacher (or need a touchscreen for other reasons), video editor, gamer or an avid consumer of streaming services, then choose something better suited to those purposes."
962,3.0,"Pros:
1. Premium build
2. Good battery life in general web browsing, ms office work, media playback, streaming etc
3. Camera quality is average but good for the price
4. Trackpad is big and comes with windows precision drivers
5. Keyboard is almost like MacBook
6. Ram is in dual channel mode clocked at 3200mhz
7. Fingerprint sensor is great
8. Wake up time is under 1 sec and there one finger lift, hinge is sturdy
9. Gives you lifetime license of ms office home 2021
10. I/O selection is good enough for everyday use

Cons:
1. The screen has some serious backlight bleed even on the replacement unit, although the saturation, contrast, color reproduction is good
2. Speakers are below average, at max volume it distorts like crazy
3. The SSD that they use is by kioxia, and it’s just the worst ssd that you can get your hands on. Even a SATA ssd performs more reliably than this. Transferred 300gb data from my Samsung t7, it started with 700MBps at 37 degrees but after just 1 min in speed dropped to 150MBps and temp went up and stayed at 75 degrees for the rest of the transfer
4. Charger that they provide is everything but portable. It’s a normal two piece laptop charger not MacBook like that realme provides
5. It stutters while playing YouTube videos on brave browser, don’t know what that is
6. Comes with tons of xiaomi bloatware so had to reinstall widows
7. Thermals are average, if you’ll push it hard it’s gonna get hot and loud real fast
8. It doesn’t charge at full 65w speeds, max that I’ve seen it charging at is 53w"
963,3.0,"I like screen quality ,fast starting ,but i am disappoint up & down button is too small as i use frequently in my work .
and some app /software pgup & Pgdn not working & its get our work bit slow as we oparate FN -pgup & PgDn."
964,5.0,"Laptop is good and working smooth. Only problem I heard from so many people is that its service. Eventhough we have so many MI service centers, they all don't have services for the laptop."
965,4.0,"So, let’s talk about good things first.

Display: Yes, it has a QHD display in 16:10 aspect ratio (roughly, the actual ratio is bit less tall) and the display quality is really god at this range or even at range of 1.5 Lakhs. The screen is not exactly matte, but does good job of dimming down reflections. Still, not suggested to take it out in the sun as the nit count is low and the screen does reflect a bit.

Build quality: Real metal, not a finger print magnet. Solid construction, almost zero keyboard and screen flex. I have not dropped it yet, but, I am sure it can handle one or two low height drops (when lid is closed).

Keyboard: Not Apple’s magic keyboard or a normal mechanical keyboard comfort, but the key travel is good and not a pain to type on. The keys are responsive and are easy to press due to to aforementioned zero flex chassis.

Sound: Almost all reviews I have seen of this laptop, along with a friend who bought this before me, complained that the speakers are trash and sound is really bad. However this is not the case. Sound is good in clarity and volume (for the price range), but since these are down firing speakers, they do get muffled for those people who place the laptop on bed, tummy or on some dining table with a table cloth. Of course, you cannot host a party with these speakers, but if you have normal environment with no loud noises around, you can rely on the speakers and enjoy music and movies. Also, please do not expect bass from laptop speakers.

Heating: I did not encounter any heating issues with this laptop even when I tried to put some load on it. I avoid using the laptop for anything heavy due to battery issues, so could not test heating a lot.

Now, onto the things which you should know before you regret buying this laptop:

Battery: Absolutely pathetic. Takes forever to charge with the charger that comes with the unit and about 2 hours to go from 10% to 100% using a 65w USB ASUS USB C charger I have. Battery drain so quick that it surprises me. 100% to 10% in less than 5 hours with very minimal use - no games, no videos, just web browsing (some Youtube, but no other streaming). I also tried charging the laptop to 100% and just keep the display on and done nothing on it. Battery down to 8% in 5.5 hour.

Size: It is a compact laptop, yes but it is big for a 14incher. This is because Xiaomi tried to be Apple and added big trackpad (which is not so responsive in the corners, so acts like a small trackpad anyway), and blank empty areas next to keyboard (which Apple uses for upward firing speakers). Using this on the lap or on the go is not difficult but a standard 14 inch laptop should be atleast 20% smaller than this. If I need big laptops, I can get a 15 inch screen on the same chassis.

Bluetooth: If anyone reading this ever had the original Mac Mini, you would know it had issues with Bluetooth connectivity due to all metal body. Same here. I have 4 wireless bluetooth headphones ranging from budget to premium ones. All of them has connectivity issues with this laptop. I tried connecting an external bluetooth dongle to the laptop, and that worked fine.

I/O: I will not get into details, but do keep in mind that only 1 USB port allows for display out and HDMI is only 4K@30Hz. Also, the transfer speed is not same or stable on either of the USB-C Thunderbolt ports.

Gaming: LOL. Gaming at this price point with Intel Iris? Come on, stick to mobile gaming."
966,3.0,After using for 1 month i happy to choose mi notebook pro the screen resolution is very good and laptop is fast and easy to use
967,4.0,Screen had a black dot .it can be used for gaming. Battery is good .the plus point is its great sound quality.it also performs great and nice Design.no heat issues..
968,3.0,"Update(after 1 year): no problem since I bought. Everything works well. The only thing that bothers me are low speakers sound, battery life, and web cam.

I'm not going to give you the specs or list down pros and cons. It's obvious now.

The thing I'm concerned is the price and it's worthiness.

Is this budget friendly?
Maybe or maybe not.
It cost me my dad's two month salary. Thanks to his early savings, we are not drowning.
So in my case, it's not or to anyone who falling on bottom line of middle class. I picked this particular one after obsessively searching and evaluating the prices of different laptops over the span of last eleven months.

Initially, I had my eyes on MSI Modern 14(Ryzen 4500u). Solid specs at that 49-54k price range. I hesitated because of the brand MSI(same can be said for MI but I will still choose it over MSI). Ram was 8gb, though I believe upgradeable but never made it clear. And then came the Windows 11 update and that model was not listed for the upgrade. So it gave me one more reason not opt to for it.

Another laptop, I might have bought, would have been Dell Inspiron 14 Ryzen 5500u, which was around 55k in the first month and when I finally decided to throw my money, they increased priced by 2 more thousands. I don't know what it's priced at now. Worth looking over, if you are ok with 45% ntsc display and ram is 8gb but ram is upgradeable.

If not this MI notebook, for now, I surely would have bought, Lenovo Thinkpad E14 AMD gen3. Fully upgradeable. Starting from around 53-55k. You can basically choose from screen to battery. Before buying it, don't forget to look for Lenovo coupon. They can give you discount up to 3k. If you don't find any, use LENGOD. I think it always works. Gives you an instant discount of 1500 rupees.

So, I still bought this MI notebook. I never bought any MI products and hate their buggy ad loaded phones. And worst, their previous year MI notebook.

I bought this laptop because it looked very promising of all out there. So far(I have been using it for last 4 days), I did not feel like I burned my money for nothing. Except battery which is...meh and the keyboard worries me, because I'm not a delicate typist. I have always typed on cheap keyboards, so I type monstrously without much care.

I would be using this laptop, mostly for programming. My tech stack is quite lightweight. React and Node(so far, it's been proved much snappier than my old computer). Though, I have planned to try Android next year. Other than that, I use chrome(which pretty easily eat up the ram), pdf reading, writing docs sometimes and nothing much fancier like video editing or gaming.

Is this worth it?

For me, it's probably have been much worthier if they have given two year warranty. As MI is fairly new I laptop market and I have bought this laptop at a great risk.

Should you buy this?
If you can wait, then wait for few more months and do your research and keep yours eyes open. We don't know for how long will this laptop will last. That's only been my concern. Rest is good. Probably the best you can find in the market right now.

I would update this review in upcoming months, if find any flaw or anything specific."
969,3.0,"Almost perfect in all aspect. Display, camera, built quality, speakers, smart mic, performance in editing and gaming, coding all 5 ⭐️. Negligible fan noise or heating issue detected. Battery backup 4-5 hours normally. Overall- worth it!"
970,5.0," Nice laptop at this price point. But only issue is that, I didn't want to buy a Chinese laptop. I was to buying samsung Book or Macbook 2021 but .. due to some budget issue, I bought this one. I'm okay with it, but not satisfied internally.. Sound quality is bad. But overall this is a good windows laptop.. trackpad is little bit shaky."
971,4.0," This is the best laptop one can buy in this price range
I will divide this review into pros and cons.
Cons: 1. It has a soldered ram so it would not be possible for the end user to upgrade it if you need more ram then you have to go for the 16 gb version .
2. Lack of an sd card reader.
3. The sound quality of the speaker is not that great.( It's not very loud .)
Other than that I couldn't find any other con in this device in the past 3 days of usage
Pros: 1: Amazing display.This display is way better than realme notebook display .For comparison 2.5k vs 2k also it comes with 100%srgb so it's colour accurate.
2:Most devices in this price range(including realme notebook) come with the core i5 G7 series processor .But this one has the H series processor which was released in January .The H series processor has a better single core and multi core performance.Also the integrated iris xe graphics is great .
3:This device doesn't lag in day to day usage and does a good job in heavy tasks such as video editing .In my case while I was editing a video I didn't notice any lag and the fan also did not kick on.
4: Xiaomi claims 12 hrs of battery life but in real life usage for web browsing and online classes of about 2 hrs you will get 6 to 7 hrs of battery backup and for heavy tasks you can expect 4 to 5 hrs of battery backup.
5.This laptop has the best built quality in a laptop in this price rang .It's the same as a macbook pro .
6:Pre installed Ms office 2019 is amazing.
7:Backlit keyboard ,charging via thunderbolt and fingerprint scanner ,wifi 6 and a huge trackpad are just amazing.
This laptop has everything a cse student needs.And I hope it lasts long. Also if you are planning to buy extended warranty then buy this laptop from mi.com with the extended warranty since the cost of extended warranty in their website and app is 3500 rps for 2 years.I bought it from Amazon so i had to buy the extended warranty seperately for which they charged me 5500 rps for 2years. Thank you."

I am product manager in MNC and writing unbiased review. This is somewhat similar to mac pro in build and screen quality. Yes this display is brilliant much similar to what MAC has."
979,4.0,Overall my rating is 3/5 the performance better since I was using 2 months but if we use it for more than 4 hours it will face over heating can't handle and it was not an gaming laptop
980,5.0,"Well after a long thought-fight with self, I finally went for it and I am glad I did so 😅

Short answer: As mentioned in tittle, ""Best in this range"".
Go for 16gb varient if you are into multitasking and 8gb if you are in looking a decent laptop for basic entertainment and goto tasks.

Long answer:
Look and build : 5/5
Screen quality: 4/5
Performance: 4/5 (I am able to run 4 code editor instances, 2 browsers with 10+tabs and a couple of other programs without any hiccups)
Battery: 4/5 (So far good)
Sound: 3/5 Could have been better but if you use headphones no worries and I am totally ok with it. (It's not a audio player to be Frank so no need to complain about it. 😅)

Overall: A Good poweful and affordable laptop!

Plus, don't think about the Soldered RAM unless you are extremely sure that you will need more for your work or you wish to absolutely upgrade in future. 16gb is more than sufficient!

Thanks Amazon!

I'll update this post after a couple of months post usage."

982,5.0,"Laptops build quality is awesome.
Screen quality is top-notch.
If someone want laptop for programming in Java, Web development like React JS or Angular . This laptop is more than enough.
battery life is awesome for coding.
If someone want windows laptop for coding with perfect price and features then this is perfect choice.

983,5.0,"Display is fine, overall built quality is Ok, but, sound quality of laptop is not acceptable. A big No, if looking for high performance or gaming"
984,5.0," I’m coming from a MacBook Pro that I use for work. I’m planning on starting my own business and wanted a laptop that could crush office work. These are my thoughts from 1 day on this laptop:

Screen: Definitely a highlight of this device. Bright, Vivid and great contrast with deep blacks (deeper than my MacBook)

Sound: Nothing can beat Apple in terms of sound quality and loudness, this is still manageable if you are not in a noisy environment

Keyboard: Very similar feel and travel compared to the MacBook, I’m able to type and hit combos with ease

Trackpad: Responsiveness to touch us comparable to MacBook, but the click is really poor. It needs a huge amount of pressure compared to the MacBook

Performance: On Par with the MacBook in terms of heating and speed, haven’t noticed connectivity drops or flickering or intense heating. It does heat, but so do MacBooks running on Intel Chips

Webcam: Another area where it absolutely outshines a MacBook Pro. It’s not the absolute best quality but it’s more manageable than what I have on my MacBook

Final Recommendation (will update as I find more): Great buy for productivity, but I would advise purchasing an additional mouse because the click is really bugging me"
985,5.0,"Overall it is good laptop but fingerprint reader is not working, i have tried updating the driver but that also doesn't help.
Support told to visit service centre but i feel it is a problem of driver software."
986,5.0,"I got this laptop for 56980 and I feel this is the best deal. Laptop is very good for student and for lifetime use. If looking for a good laptop, you can go for this."
987,5.0,"Have been using the laptop for nearly 6 months now. Here is my take:

Pros:
1) Great screen, images are crisp and colorful. Decent even for outdoor working.
2) Sturdy form-factor. Despite of being light weight it feels solidly built. Plus the one finger lid open is cool.
3) Wifi and Bluetooth connectivity are stable too.
4) Finger print recognition is on the power button (sensible design) and works quite well.
5) Good assortment of connectivity ports.
6) Efficient start-up time.

Cons:
1) Very poor speaker output, you will struggle to hear a word especially if you have a fan switch-on in the room. You would definitely require a external speaker for multimedia.
2) The track-pad is just not good. Not very accurate, unwanted gesture recognition and all in all irritating to work with. Ideally you would be using a external mouse for work.
3) The metal body does retain some static charge while charging. Although very minor but it still does.

Acceptable:
1) The keyboard is decent enough for work. Although personally hate the miniaturized Up/Down arrows. Also not a fan of the positioning of the CTRL and Fn keys, frequently miss click them. Back-lighting is also good enough.
2) Battery charge last for a decent 6 hours in above moderate usage. Also doesn't get scorching hot ever on high utilization.
3) Decent value for money, not the best but good enough for under 60k with the i5+16gb version.
4) Web cam is not very good, but okayish for normal work calls."
988,3.0,Getting heated while using and charging.. Except this issue rest is ok to buy this product.
989,5.0,Mi notebook pro 15 is a lovely laptop. Very happy with the purchase
990,5.0, I would say best laptop in uts price range and specifications also being totally metallic build.
991,5.0,"great laptop/Notebook with great display and long lasting battery backup and lightweight..
great for working professionals not suitable for gaming .."
992,2.0,Really nice
993,5.0,"Just got this laptop today, so based on just a few hours of usage.
Earlier using Lenovo Yoga 510 with touch and 360 degree rotation, but I havnt used these features much.

Needed a sturdy laptop, with latest specs, great display and for personal use, and as a backup if my office laptop dies on suddenly, but main purpose was entertainment, personal document work, photo editing as I am a photography enthusiast. Display was very important for me.

(Update 17/9/21: There are ways to calibrate the display, built in the laptop itself, to some extent and this is awesome. I was able to tweak the display fairly close to printing colors, all ok now)-----This department still I feel a bit short on my expectation, as it has 100% sRGB and 2k resolution. Sure its crisp and bright and way better then any mainstream laptop display, but colors are not accurate(100% sRGB means it can display all the colors in that space, but it doesn't claim or deliver accurate display). There is a lot of difference between pics edited on this computer and the prints I take on my sRGB space printer, even more so than my previous 5 year old lenovo with Full HD IPS display. I would test this out more and update. So not a replacement of a proper color accurate display. On the other hand, colors do not feel as punchy for watching movies etc, but not a big deal for me. Display for any other task is good enough, very sharp and much brighter than other laptops in the market. I am not disappointed, but not impressed based on what my usage is.

Please bear in mind this is a special requirement, 99.99% people would be amazed with the display quality, as this was amazing for day to day usage. Just not for critical work, and for the price I dont think anything comes close.(see update above)

As far as other things go, performance, boot times, finger print, typing on keyboard, look and feel are all great. Seems sturdy, so should be good for a long time. This laptop is also not for gamers, as I feel performance for very heavy games and other tasks a little short, people need for video editing should spend some more for the i7 version or better assemble a desktop if mobility is not absolutely a necessity. Mine is i5 16gb which is good enough for me. Battery life is good for 8 hours of light work.

Overall, for the price, and considering all metal build and performance it offers, this is a great buy. Just see your use case, take sometime to review your own requirements, and then consider. As a day to day laptop, I dont see anyone would find any shortcoming with this laptop. Its fine in all the departments."
994,4.0,"Pros -

2. PORT FINISHING QUALITY IS NOT GOOD IN AND OUT USB AND PENDRIVE IT'S VERY DIFFICULT"
996,4.0,great one
997,4.0,Sound volume is a bit low but manageable. The battery life could have been better.
998,4.0,"I'm purchased this laptop on 5th September, and delivered on 12th September 2021. I ordered the laptop after its launch,this review is after one year usage, 27 October 2022 the keyboard Stopped Working, after visiting the service center they said inorder to repair it cost 6000 + Service Charge, not only in my laptop, at the service center so many people faced this issue, So if you want to spend too much on small things related to laptop, then you go ahead with this laptop.

1Year Experience of Laptop Usage
No 1: Heating after using 2 or 3 applications, You also hear fan noise with general usage sometimes
No 2: Sound is Very Low
No 3: Sometimes it lags Very much even if you stop the task manager services.
No 4: Keyboard is easily attracting dust in it, you may face the button not able to click.

Consider these factors you still want to buy for one usage and spend too much in it."
999,4.0,"Awesome lapi. But if you can stretch a little bit more on money, I will suggest buy Mi Notebook Ultra. Just because the screen size is larger than Pro. Working on Notebook Pro is a difficult job as the screen size is small and also the fonts are smaller too. But you can change fonts according to your requirement.

Second point-The lapi is very fast. I will suggest buy a two fan cooling pad. The body is made up of metal it gets hot very quickly.

Third point- (read till end) I installed few apps and it started to hang. Every time i switch on my lapi it hangs automatically. I raised a service request for that but than I realised that I think the antivirus which I installed is causing the issue. I uninstalled the antivirus and the lapi is now working fine.

Its been 3 weeks and the system is working fine without any issues. The machine is super fast and easy to use. Out of 10 its 8 just because the screen size is small. Don't go for HP and Dell. Mi is giving you the best of the best at lowest price.
And if it comes to your mind that Xiaomi is a Chinese company then please check the manufacturer of HP,Dell, Lenovo, Acer etc. All the lapi are manufactured in china.
Go for Mi Notebook Ultra/Pro. They are best in the market in features as well as price."

All in all a perfect companion to aquire 🙏🙏🙏"
1002,4.0,"I won't tell all good things which YouTube channels are promoting. Good part is overall laptop is good. I will rate 3.5 star out of 5.

Now why 3.5 stars:
1. The edges to open lid with single hand are super sharp one can get easily scratched.
2. Super con - no grip. Seriously MI forgot to put grip below laptop. It doesn't stick to the table and slide like seesaw.
3. Speakers are poor
4. No camera shutter for privacy and yes camera is of poor quality doesn't even feel like 720p
5. Thermal go high on and above keyboard area while charging
6. Type C charge provide is of super cheap quality - utter cost cutting. Definately one need to spend 2k just after a year or so because its not going to last long
7. No idea about after sale service
8. 16:10 is just gimmick - ran Sheehan on amazon prime the video filled 50% portion of the screen and rest was black

After using it for few days I feel this laptop 16GB+I5 is bit highly priced. It should be somewhere between 50-55k not more than that. Come on MI you are not a well established brand in laptop world like hp or dell, you should have atleast provided an aggressive pricing.

So to conclude it finally, if you can live with above cons go ahead and buy it. It will serve your purpose for next 4-5yrs"

1009,4.0,"I'm writing this review after about 4 months of usage, so it's based on a mixture of the purchase criteria/comparisons and actual usage. I wanted a no-frills laptop which was powerful but inexpensive. I looked at the Dells and Lenovos within the sub-60k price range but finally settled on this. Two and a half months later, no regrets.

You need to be clear what you want and what you’re getting because this config won’t satisfy everyone. Given below are my criteria for choosing this and a comparison of how this fares against the others I looked at.

CPU – Wanted an 11th gen i5 and this one has an i5-11300H – not G – so it has adequate power for the next few years.

RAM – I wanted either upgradeable 8GB RAM with a free slot or on-board 16GB. Through the years, my experience has been that buying a budget config laptop and doubling its RAM after a year or two really extends its life. Today, that means buying 8GB and upgrading to 16 later. Well, this one has 16GB out of the box so it should last a few years.

Graphics card – This doesn’t have an external NVIDIA card. So if you’re editing videos, playing graphics-intensive games or programming neural nets, then don’t go for this.

Touchscreen – Didn’t want to spend money on this. I’m fine with a good quality trackpad. If you want a touchscreen, you’ve got to either raise your price point or compromise on something else (RAM, screen quality etc) at this price point.

Screen Brightness - I wanted a screen bright enough to work outdoors in the afternoon and pretty much everything from the standard brands fell short on this front. My reading of the market (as of June 2022) is that you have to spend 80-90k+ on the more standard brands to get that kind of screen. But I’ve used this laptop outdoors in the afternoon quite often and there’s no issues, even on a bright afternoon.

Screen Resolution, Clarity, Contrast, Viewing Angles etc – Let’s be clear, this is not an OLED screen. You want the best of those, go for an ASUS. But it is high res and sharp. Viewing angles are great and so are colours. The best feature is that this screen has matte finish. None of those irritating ambient reflections in sunlight which a clear glossy screen is prey to. If you want to sit outdoors and work (browsing , editing, spreadsheets, presentations, coding etc), this is a great screen. What it is not great for is watching movies. Nothing like a clean, glossy OLED screen with muted ambient lighting for watching Netflix.

Sound – It’s adequate but nothing great to write home about. As I said, this laptop is not your best choice for media consumption.

Ports – My laptop is normally plugged into a monitor, keyboard, mouse, power and speakers at my desk. As a result, it’s a bit of a pain to unplug and reattach so many cables every time. Which is why I was keen on Thunderbolt 4. The thought of simply unplugging one wire and walking off with the laptop was very attractive. A good USB 4 hub is expensive, so I haven’t bought one yet, but it’s no.1 on my to-buy list. Many brands seem to think that Thunderbolt 4 is a premium feature, meant only for laptops which cost 80k+. For a non-premium guy like me it’s fortunate that Xiaomi included it in this laptop.

Looks and Durability – It’s an all metal body which looks sleek. As for durability, the metal body should prevent damage from minor falls. But the least durable parts of a laptop are the trackpad and the hinges – and I have no way of telling whether these will last or not. So no idea about this.

All in all, if you’re looking for a portable, inexpensive (I got this for 55k with exchange), laptop for work and regular use, this was the best available in June 2022 at this price point. You can use it in your balcony/garden, plug it back in very conveniently at your desk and the config should last 3-4 years easily. But if you’re a teacher (or need a touchscreen for other reasons), video editor, gamer or an avid consumer of streaming services, then choose something better suited to those purposes."
1010,4.0,"Pros:
1. Premium build
2. Good battery life in general web browsing, ms office work, media playback, streaming etc
3. Camera quality is average but good for the price
4. Trackpad is big and comes with windows precision drivers
5. Keyboard is almost like MacBook
6. Ram is in dual channel mode clocked at 3200mhz
7. Fingerprint sensor is great
8. Wake up time is under 1 sec and there one finger lift, hinge is sturdy
9. Gives you lifetime license of ms office home 2021
10. I/O selection is good enough for everyday use

Cons:
1. The screen has some serious backlight bleed even on the replacement unit, although the saturation, contrast, color reproduction is good
2. Speakers are below average, at max volume it distorts like crazy
3. The SSD that they use is by kioxia, and it’s just the worst ssd that you can get your hands on. Even a SATA ssd performs more reliably than this. Transferred 300gb data from my Samsung t7, it started with 700MBps at 37 degrees but after just 1 min in speed dropped to 150MBps and temp went up and stayed at 75 degrees for the rest of the transfer
4. Charger that they provide is everything but portable. It’s a normal two piece laptop charger not MacBook like that realme provides
5. It stutters while playing YouTube videos on brave browser, don’t know what that is
6. Comes with tons of xiaomi bloatware so had to reinstall widows
7. Thermals are average, if you’ll push it hard it’s gonna get hot and loud real fast
8. It doesn’t charge at full 65w speeds, max that I’ve seen it charging at is 53w"
1011,5.0,"I like screen quality ,fast starting ,but i am disappoint up & down button is too small as i use frequently in my work .
and some app /software pgup & Pgdn not working & its get our work bit slow as we oparate FN -pgup & PgDn."
1012,3.0,"Laptop is good and working smooth. Only problem I heard from so many people is that its service. Eventhough we have so many MI service centers, they all don't have services for the laptop."
1013,3.0,"So, let’s talk about good things first.

Display: Yes, it has a QHD display in 16:10 aspect ratio (roughly, the actual ratio is bit less tall) and the display quality is really god at this range or even at range of 1.5 Lakhs. The screen is not exactly matte, but does good job of dimming down reflections. Still, not suggested to take it out in the sun as the nit count is low and the screen does reflect a bit.

Build quality: Real metal, not a finger print magnet. Solid construction, almost zero keyboard and screen flex. I have not dropped it yet, but, I am sure it can handle one or two low height drops (when lid is closed).

Keyboard: Not Apple’s magic keyboard or a normal mechanical keyboard comfort, but the key travel is good and not a pain to type on. The keys are responsive and are easy to press due to to aforementioned zero flex chassis.

Sound: Almost all reviews I have seen of this laptop, along with a friend who bought this before me, complained that the speakers are trash and sound is really bad. However this is not the case. Sound is good in clarity and volume (for the price range), but since these are down firing speakers, they do get muffled for those people who place the laptop on bed, tummy or on some dining table with a table cloth. Of course, you cannot host a party with these speakers, but if you have normal environment with no loud noises around, you can rely on the speakers and enjoy music and movies. Also, please do not expect bass from laptop speakers.

Heating: I did not encounter any heating issues with this laptop even when I tried to put some load on it. I avoid using the laptop for anything heavy due to battery issues, so could not test heating a lot.

Now, onto the things which you should know before you regret buying this laptop:

Battery: Absolutely pathetic. Takes forever to charge with the charger that comes with the unit and about 2 hours to go from 10% to 100% using a 65w USB ASUS USB C charger I have. Battery drain so quick that it surprises me. 100% to 10% in less than 5 hours with very minimal use - no games, no videos, just web browsing (some Youtube, but no other streaming). I also tried charging the laptop to 100% and just keep the display on and done nothing on it. Battery down to 8% in 5.5 hour.

Size: It is a compact laptop, yes but it is big for a 14incher. This is because Xiaomi tried to be Apple and added big trackpad (which is not so responsive in the corners, so acts like a small trackpad anyway), and blank empty areas next to keyboard (which Apple uses for upward firing speakers). Using this on the lap or on the go is not difficult but a standard 14 inch laptop should be atleast 20% smaller than this. If I need big laptops, I can get a 15 inch screen on the same chassis.

Bluetooth: If anyone reading this ever had the original Mac Mini, you would know it had issues with Bluetooth connectivity due to all metal body. Same here. I have 4 wireless bluetooth headphones ranging from budget to premium ones. All of them has connectivity issues with this laptop. I tried connecting an external bluetooth dongle to the laptop, and that worked fine.

I/O: I will not get into details, but do keep in mind that only 1 USB port allows for display out and HDMI is only 4K@30Hz. Also, the transfer speed is not same or stable on either of the USB-C Thunderbolt ports.

Gaming: LOL. Gaming at this price point with Intel Iris? Come on, stick to mobile gaming."
1014,5.0,After using for 1 month i happy to choose mi notebook pro the screen resolution is very good and laptop is fast and easy to use
1015,4.0,Screen had a black dot .it can be used for gaming. Battery is good .the plus point is its great sound quality.it also performs great and nice Design.no heat issues..
1016,3.0,"Update(after 1 year): no problem since I bought. Everything works well. The only thing that bothers me are low speakers sound, battery life, and web cam.

I'm not going to give you the specs or list down pros and cons. It's obvious now.

The thing I'm concerned is the price and it's worthiness.

Is this budget friendly?
Maybe or maybe not.
It cost me my dad's two month salary. Thanks to his early savings, we are not drowning.
So in my case, it's not or to anyone who falling on bottom line of middle class. I picked this particular one after obsessively searching and evaluating the prices of different laptops over the span of last eleven months.

Initially, I had my eyes on MSI Modern 14(Ryzen 4500u). Solid specs at that 49-54k price range. I hesitated because of the brand MSI(same can be said for MI but I will still choose it over MSI). Ram was 8gb, though I believe upgradeable but never made it clear. And then came the Windows 11 update and that model was not listed for the upgrade. So it gave me one more reason not opt to for it.

Another laptop, I might have bought, would have been Dell Inspiron 14 Ryzen 5500u, which was around 55k in the first month and when I finally decided to throw my money, they increased priced by 2 more thousands. I don't know what it's priced at now. Worth looking over, if you are ok with 45% ntsc display and ram is 8gb but ram is upgradeable.

If not this MI notebook, for now, I surely would have bought, Lenovo Thinkpad E14 AMD gen3. Fully upgradeable. Starting from around 53-55k. You can basically choose from screen to battery. Before buying it, don't forget to look for Lenovo coupon. They can give you discount up to 3k. If you don't find any, use LENGOD. I think it always works. Gives you an instant discount of 1500 rupees.

So, I still bought this MI notebook. I never bought any MI products and hate their buggy ad loaded phones. And worst, their previous year MI notebook.

I bought this laptop because it looked very promising of all out there. So far(I have been using it for last 4 days), I did not feel like I burned my money for nothing. Except battery which is...meh and the keyboard worries me, because I'm not a delicate typist. I have always typed on cheap keyboards, so I type monstrously without much care.

I would be using this laptop, mostly for programming. My tech stack is quite lightweight. React and Node(so far, it's been proved much snappier than my old computer). Though, I have planned to try Android next year. Other than that, I use chrome(which pretty easily eat up the ram), pdf reading, writing docs sometimes and nothing much fancier like video editing or gaming.

Is this worth it?

For me, it's probably have been much worthier if they have given two year warranty. As MI is fairly new I laptop market and I have bought this laptop at a great risk.

Should you buy this?
If you can wait, then wait for few more months and do your research and keep yours eyes open. We don't know for how long will this laptop will last. That's only been my concern. Rest is good. Probably the best you can find in the market right now.

I would update this review in upcoming months, if find any flaw or anything specific."
1017,4.0,"Almost perfect in all aspect. Display, camera, built quality, speakers, smart mic, performance in editing and gaming, coding all 5 ⭐️. Negligible fan noise or heating issue detected. Battery backup 4-5 hours normally. Overall- worth it!"
1018,3.0," Nice laptop at this price point. But only issue is that, I didn't want to buy a Chinese laptop. I was to buying samsung Book or Macbook 2021 but .. due to some budget issue, I bought this one. I'm okay with it, but not satisfied internally.. Sound quality is bad. But overall this is a good windows laptop.. trackpad is little bit shaky."
1019,3.0," This is the best laptop one can buy in this price range
I will divide this review into pros and cons.
Cons: 1. It has a soldered ram so it would not be possible for the end user to upgrade it if you need more ram then you have to go for the 16 gb version .
2. Lack of an sd card reader.
3. The sound quality of the speaker is not that great.( It's not very loud .)
Other than that I couldn't find any other con in this device in the past 3 days of usage
Pros: 1: Amazing display.This display is way better than realme notebook display .For comparison 2.5k vs 2k also it comes with 100%srgb so it's colour accurate.
2:Most devices in this price range(including realme notebook) come with the core i5 G7 series processor .But this one has the H series processor which was released in January .The H series processor has a better single core and multi core performance.Also the integrated iris xe graphics is great .
3:This device doesn't lag in day to day usage and does a good job in heavy tasks such as video editing .In my case while I was editing a video I didn't notice any lag and the fan also did not kick on.
4: Xiaomi claims 12 hrs of battery life but in real life usage for web browsing and online classes of about 2 hrs you will get 6 to 7 hrs of battery backup and for heavy tasks you can expect 4 to 5 hrs of battery backup.
5.This laptop has the best built quality in a laptop in this price rang .It's the same as a macbook pro .
6:Pre installed Ms office 2019 is amazing.
7:Backlit keyboard ,charging via thunderbolt and fingerprint scanner ,wifi 6 and a huge trackpad are just amazing.
This laptop has everything a cse student needs.And I hope it lasts long. Also if you are planning to buy extended warranty then buy this laptop from mi.com with the extended warranty since the cost of extended warranty in their website and app is 3500 rps for 2 years.I bought it from Amazon so i had to buy the extended warranty seperately for which they charged me 5500 rps for 2years. Thank you."

I am product manager in MNC and writing unbiased review. This is somewhat similar to mac pro in build and screen quality. Yes this display is brilliant much similar to what MAC has."
1027,4.0,Overall my rating is 3/5 the performance better since I was using 2 months but if we use it for more than 4 hours it will face over heating can't handle and it was not an gaming laptop
1028,4.0,"Well after a long thought-fight with self, I finally went for it and I am glad I did so 😅

Short answer: As mentioned in tittle, ""Best in this range"".
Go for 16gb varient if you are into multitasking and 8gb if you are in looking a decent laptop for basic entertainment and goto tasks.

Long answer:
Look and build : 5/5
Screen quality: 4/5
Performance: 4/5 (I am able to run 4 code editor instances, 2 browsers with 10+tabs and a couple of other programs without any hiccups)
Battery: 4/5 (So far good)
Sound: 3/5 Could have been better but if you use headphones no worries and I am totally ok with it. (It's not a audio player to be Frank so no need to complain about it. 😅)

Overall: A Good poweful and affordable laptop!

Plus, don't think about the Soldered RAM unless you are extremely sure that you will need more for your work or you wish to absolutely upgrade in future. 16gb is more than sufficient!

Thanks Amazon!

I'll update this post after a couple of months post usage."
1029,4.0,">Decent camera quality: can't say very good or worst.

1030,5.0,"Laptops build quality is awesome.
Screen quality is top-notch.
If someone want laptop for programming in Java, Web development like React JS or Angular . This laptop is more than enough.
battery life is awesome for coding.
If someone want windows laptop for coding with perfect price and features then this is perfect choice.

Even you can do basic video editing, photoshop"
1031,3.0,"Display is fine, overall built quality is Ok, but, sound quality of laptop is not acceptable. A big No, if looking for high performance or gaming"
1032,5.0," I’m coming from a MacBook Pro that I use for work. I’m planning on starting my own business and wanted a laptop that could crush office work. These are my thoughts from 1 day on this laptop:

Screen: Definitely a highlight of this device. Bright, Vivid and great contrast with deep blacks (deeper than my MacBook)

Sound: Nothing can beat Apple in terms of sound quality and loudness, this is still manageable if you are not in a noisy environment

Keyboard: Very similar feel and travel compared to the MacBook, I’m able to type and hit combos with ease

Trackpad: Responsiveness to touch us comparable to MacBook, but the click is really poor. It needs a huge amount of pressure compared to the MacBook

Performance: On Par with the MacBook in terms of heating and speed, haven’t noticed connectivity drops or flickering or intense heating. It does heat, but so do MacBooks running on Intel Chips

Webcam: Another area where it absolutely outshines a MacBook Pro. It’s not the absolute best quality but it’s more manageable than what I have on my MacBook

Final Recommendation (will update as I find more): Great buy for productivity, but I would advise purchasing an additional mouse because the click is really bugging me"
1033,5.0,"Overall it is good laptop but fingerprint reader is not working, i have tried updating the driver but that also doesn't help.
Support told to visit service centre but i feel it is a problem of driver software."
1034,5.0,"I got this laptop for 56980 and I feel this is the best deal. Laptop is very good for student and for lifetime use. If looking for a good laptop, you can go for this."
1035,5.0,"Have been using the laptop for nearly 6 months now. Here is my take:

Pros:
1) Great screen, images are crisp and colorful. Decent even for outdoor working.
2) Sturdy form-factor. Despite of being light weight it feels solidly built. Plus the one finger lid open is cool.
3) Wifi and Bluetooth connectivity are stable too.
4) Finger print recognition is on the power button (sensible design) and works quite well.
5) Good assortment of connectivity ports.
6) Efficient start-up time.

Cons:
1) Very poor speaker output, you will struggle to hear a word especially if you have a fan switch-on in the room. You would definitely require a external speaker for multimedia.
2) The track-pad is just not good. Not very accurate, unwanted gesture recognition and all in all irritating to work with. Ideally you would be using a external mouse for work.
3) The metal body does retain some static charge while charging. Although very minor but it still does.

Acceptable:
1) The keyboard is decent enough for work. Although personally hate the miniaturized Up/Down arrows. Also not a fan of the positioning of the CTRL and Fn keys, frequently miss click them. Back-lighting is also good enough.
2) Battery charge last for a decent 6 hours in above moderate usage. Also doesn't get scorching hot ever on high utilization.
3) Decent value for money, not the best but good enough for under 60k with the i5+16gb version.
4) Web cam is not very good, but okayish for normal work calls."
1036,5.0,Getting heated while using and charging.. Except this issue rest is ok to buy this product.
1037,5.0,Mi notebook pro 15 is a lovely laptop. Very happy with the purchase
1038,3.0, I would say best laptop in uts price range and specifications also being totally metallic build.
1039,5.0,"great laptop/Notebook with great display and long lasting battery backup and lightweight..
great for working professionals not suitable for gaming .."
1040,5.0,Really nice
1041,5.0,"Just got this laptop today, so based on just a few hours of usage.
Earlier using Lenovo Yoga 510 with touch and 360 degree rotation, but I havnt used these features much.

Needed a sturdy laptop, with latest specs, great display and for personal use, and as a backup if my office laptop dies on suddenly, but main purpose was entertainment, personal document work, photo editing as I am a photography enthusiast. Display was very important for me.

(Update 17/9/21: There are ways to calibrate the display, built in the laptop itself, to some extent and this is awesome. I was able to tweak the display fairly close to printing colors, all ok now)-----This department still I feel a bit short on my expectation, as it has 100% sRGB and 2k resolution. Sure its crisp and bright and way better then any mainstream laptop display, but colors are not accurate(100% sRGB means it can display all the colors in that space, but it doesn't claim or deliver accurate display). There is a lot of difference between pics edited on this computer and the prints I take on my sRGB space printer, even more so than my previous 5 year old lenovo with Full HD IPS display. I would test this out more and update. So not a replacement of a proper color accurate display. On the other hand, colors do not feel as punchy for watching movies etc, but not a big deal for me. Display for any other task is good enough, very sharp and much brighter than other laptops in the market. I am not disappointed, but not impressed based on what my usage is.

Please bear in mind this is a special requirement, 99.99% people would be amazed with the display quality, as this was amazing for day to day usage. Just not for critical work, and for the price I dont think anything comes close.(see update above)

As far as other things go, performance, boot times, finger print, typing on keyboard, look and feel are all great. Seems sturdy, so should be good for a long time. This laptop is also not for gamers, as I feel performance for very heavy games and other tasks a little short, people need for video editing should spend some more for the i7 version or better assemble a desktop if mobility is not absolutely a necessity. Mine is i5 16gb which is good enough for me. Battery life is good for 8 hours of light work.

Overall, for the price, and considering all metal build and performance it offers, this is a great buy. Just see your use case, take sometime to review your own requirements, and then consider. As a day to day laptop, I dont see anyone would find any shortcoming with this laptop. Its fine in all the departments."
1042,2.0,"Pros -
1. Perfect size and light weight 1.4kg
2. The product is well built and feels premium
3. very smooth 60Hz
4. It doesn't Heat easily and it can easily manage May tasks at once
5. Display is superb
Cons -
1.camera is not so clear
I'll repot again in a few weeks of usage"
1043,5.0,"OVERALL IT IS A VERY GOOD LAPTOP BUT 2THINGS ARE NOT GOOD
1. THE TRACKPAD SHOULD BE USE GLASS OR HARD MATERIAL CLICKING SOUND MAKES LOW QUALITY
2. PORT FINISHING QUALITY IS NOT GOOD IN AND OUT USB AND PENDRIVE IT'S VERY DIFFICULT"
1044,3.0,great one
1045,5.0,Sound volume is a bit low but manageable. The battery life could have been better.
1046,5.0,"I'm purchased this laptop on 5th September, and delivered on 12th September 2021. I ordered the laptop after its launch,this review is after one year usage, 27 October 2022 the keyboard Stopped Working, after visiting the service center they said inorder to repair it cost 6000 + Service Charge, not only in my laptop, at the service center so many people faced this issue, So if you want to spend too much on small things related to laptop, then you go ahead with this laptop.

1Year Experience of Laptop Usage
No 1: Heating after using 2 or 3 applications, You also hear fan noise with general usage sometimes
No 2: Sound is Very Low
No 3: Sometimes it lags Very much even if you stop the task manager services.
No 4: Keyboard is easily attracting dust in it, you may face the button not able to click.

Consider these factors you still want to buy for one usage and spend too much in it."
1047,5.0,"Awesome lapi. But if you can stretch a little bit more on money, I will suggest buy Mi Notebook Ultra. Just because the screen size is larger than Pro. Working on Notebook Pro is a difficult job as the screen size is small and also the fonts are smaller too. But you can change fonts according to your requirement.

Second point-The lapi is very fast. I will suggest buy a two fan cooling pad. The body is made up of metal it gets hot very quickly.

Third point- (read till end) I installed few apps and it started to hang. Every time i switch on my lapi it hangs automatically. I raised a service request for that but than I realised that I think the antivirus which I installed is causing the issue. I uninstalled the antivirus and the lapi is now working fine.

Its been 3 weeks and the system is working fine without any issues. The machine is super fast and easy to use. Out of 10 its 8 just because the screen size is small. Don't go for HP and Dell. Mi is giving you the best of the best at lowest price.
And if it comes to your mind that Xiaomi is a Chinese company then please check the manufacturer of HP,Dell, Lenovo, Acer etc. All the lapi are manufactured in china.
Go for Mi Notebook Ultra/Pro. They are best in the market in features as well as price."
1048,5.0,This is very imp. Product.
1049,5.0,"Perfect for seminar presentation as MS office 2021 student edition included .

Slim 14 inch model perfect for carrying in light baggage.

All in all a perfect companion to aquire 🙏🙏🙏"
1050,5.0,"I won't tell all good things which YouTube channels are promoting. Good part is overall laptop is good. I will rate 3.5 star out of 5.

Now why 3.5 stars:
1. The edges to open lid with single hand are super sharp one can get easily scratched.
2. Super con - no grip. Seriously MI forgot to put grip below laptop. It doesn't stick to the table and slide like seesaw.
3. Speakers are poor
4. No camera shutter for privacy and yes camera is of poor quality doesn't even feel like 720p
5. Thermal go high on and above keyboard area while charging
6. Type C charge provide is of super cheap quality - utter cost cutting. Definately one need to spend 2k just after a year or so because its not going to last long
7. No idea about after sale service
8. 16:10 is just gimmick - ran Sheehan on amazon prime the video filled 50% portion of the screen and rest was black

After using it for few days I feel this laptop 16GB+I5 is bit highly priced. It should be somewhere between 50-55k not more than that. Come on MI you are not a well established brand in laptop world like hp or dell, you should have atleast provided an aggressive pricing.

So to conclude it finally, if you can live with above cons go ahead and buy it. It will serve your purpose for next 4-5yrs"

Performance as it is can be termed as very good
Ms Office home , norton antivirus is pre installed without license so you have to purchase a license key additionally if you wish to use these beyond the trial period of a few days
I am totally disappointed not for the performance but because I like to be in full control of the device which in this case is not possible so only 2 stars for the product as it boots up and shuts down as expected off an ssd.

After 2 days of struggle I called acer service to make it possible to boot from usb devices and the service person visited and whatever he tried (mostly changes in bios security settings) simply made the pre loaded win 11 also non bootable and not repairable, as per my habit I had a rescue disk already made out of the installed system and a backup image prepared from the win 11 in spite of which the operating system remained useless and I had to go back to a fresh install of windows 10 from my own win 10 install media and then upgrade to win 11.

After lot many tries I've found out that fedora 34 onwards can be installed from usb drives on this hardware and may be other uefi compatible ones too may get working on it.

1134,5.0,There is no indicator light if laptop is in starting mode like every laptop has. This is the major disadvantage otherwise this is the best laptop in this price ibuyed it in 40k
1135,1.0,It's just 2weeks .....all are good but the battery is draining out faster....
1136,5.0,Sound and display quality very poor
1137,1.0,Laptop's hardware so light and finishing is so good.
1138,5.0,Display not good and sound quality low
1139,5.0,Nice model.
1140,5.0,Student के लिए काफी ठीक है
1141,1.0,
1142,5.0,"Screen, smooth operation, gaming not tried yet, but front camera having no shield which is ridiculous, lens is exposed to everything like dust and water, water or dust may also get inside from this hole"
1143,1.0,"Amazing Speed with Great great Battery Backup - More than 5 hours Battery backup, just took 7 seconds to boot in Windows 11.

Fully satisfied again with Acer. I bought my 3rd Acer Laptop in Last 6 years and Fully satisfied with Built Quality and performance. Much better than Lenovo HP Dell Brands which are also 8K-10K costly"
1144,5.0,Gets heated a lot
1145,5.0,Value for money 💵
1146,4.0,Nice product
1147,4.0,"Product can be considered at price point of 38k , Not best but good features, i5 , 512ssd are minimum requirements for any laptop"
1148,5.0,Awesome laptop
1149,4.0, Nice product but display not good
1150,4.0,"Anyone who is looking to use this for office work and non gaming activity and for development purpose you can easily go ahead and take this laptop . Male sure to upgrade this laptop with 16 GB of additional RAM of 2400 MHz to maximize performance. Also I have maxed out in configuration by having wifi 6 card , 1 tb ssd and 1 tb NVME installed in the Laptop. It costed me around ₹48000/- with all these upgrade so at this price point it is good. Battery is also good initially. Now at this time it is giving me around 4-5 hours backup easily on battery . The biggest advantage is the screensize which is aclear win here. So anyone who is tight on budget and looking to upgrade the laptop later please don't hesitate to get this one and upgrade later."
1151,4.0,Good
1152,4.0,"In this price range everything is good but bettery backup upto 3 hours
Screen quality is average
Only missing ms office"
1153,5.0,Battery capacity is too low which lasts 1hr while internet surfing. If you use design software's like AutoCAD or Solidworks you should connect charger all time and they provide battery capacity as 45Wh but it is not true real capacity is 36Wh. Display is sometimes blinking which you notice while closing apps(may be it's a software issue Windows 11). Speaker also at the average. Performance is good if you want performance compromise with other specs.
1154,4.0,"After 1 week of usage , the laptop is quite good in terms of performance. The battery life is also quite good. No cons as of now everything seems wonderful at ₹25k price point for i5 , we can't expect more."
1155,3.0,"laptop is nice, only issue is with battery, lasts 4-5 hrs after being fully charged"
1156,3.0,very nice

1158,3.0,"This is a very good laptop so far, i’ve bough 16gb ram, Intel Core i5 11th Gen version.
It’s too good for gaming but before you start gaming in it, do some boost things. It’ll hell you out alot."
1159,5.0,I got value for my money. Laptop is so good and is everything you can think of.
1160,5.0,"Performs really great for its price, has a good set of ports, it is also upgradable and it really looks very good 👍

Screen is apparently a tn panel but that's ok, however it would have been better to see an ips Or a more color accurate or brighter display

Weight and battery life are also good.

Overall it's worth it's price.

Please note it is not a gaming or creative device.

It is good for productivity, coding,school/college, office and general usage since it has a good single core performance, 8gb ram and a fast nvme ssd."

Pro's -

1. The screen is very beautiful thin bezzel full hd led display. Great for contant consumption
2. The sleek design. Looks very nice and professional
3. Wifi and Bluetooth connectivity are too good.

Cons

1. Major screen wobbling issue. Reffer to the video above
2. It does not have a finger print sensor
3. Heating issues. A cooling pad is a must,if you keep it on a surface like your bed

Average

1. Battery backup is average. It lasts upto 5 hour when screen brightness is 30 on normal use and content consumption. Might go down upto two hour when gaming intensively. (Plug in your laptop while gaming for best performance)

2. Speakers are just kaam chaalau . They are not that bad nor too good . I use oneplus buds z for better experience

That is all about this machine . I hope it will help you."

It had been used for 6 months and returned to the shop. I am very upset and disappointed with this purchase , Preet Technology and Amazon.in.

Battery on 10% brightness wifi on- 5+ hours

Bad for video editing as GPU is not powerful
Can handle casual games
Light weight

Heating - no issue if use on table, will heat if vents are blocked like on bed (obviously)
Web cam -poor as that of any other laptop
2 USB ports only on left side which is a small problem

Overall- Buy it at around 57K, though I bought it at 58K

1293,3.0,Excellent
1294,3.0,"I purchased it on May 11,2022
Review as on 12June, 2022:

Battery on 10% brightness wifi on- 5+ hours
Processing power is more than enough for everyday tasks and coding

Bad for video editing as GPU is not powerful
Can handle casual games
Light weight

Heating - no issue if use on table, will heat if vents are blocked like on bed (obviously)
Web cam -poor as that of any other laptop
2 USB ports only on left side which is a small problem

Overall- Buy it at around 57K, though I bought it at 58K

Don't forget to check offline stores 👍"
1295,3.0,"Overall a good laptop under 40k.but there are some disappointments related to this laptop.
1)screen brightness is not good.
2)DVD drive is not there.
3)less numbers of usb and type C ports.
4)Internet pin port is missing in this laptop."
1296,5.0,Seriously value for money
1297,5.0,"Laptop looks stylish and looks premium however only time will tell how the built quality is. Serves my work related purpose. Performace is good as the clock speed of processor is 3 Ghz (not 4.1 which is maximum extent of clocking purformance of the processor.
Pro:-
1. Looks premium ( hp logo is cheery on top)
2. Keyboard quality is good and all necessary keys are present on keyboard (no need of pressing fn for some important keys like home, pageup and page down etc.
3. Speaker quality is very good compared to lenovo, asus or dell in this price range. Loud and clear.
4. Two usb type A 3.0 and one usb type C 3.0 (might be 3.2 I am not sure)
5. Pre-installed OS and office with lifetime validity
6. Browsing speed is also very good

Con:-
1. Visibility of alphabets and numbers becomes very bad in low light condition (might not be a con for experienced typist). Keys are not even like somwhere its ok and somwhere its bumpy or not aligned properly. But typing will not get affected.
2. Screen quality is very down grade. Other laptops like Asus are providing Oled display in this price range. Brightness is very low. My old lenovo Ideapad has better brightness and clearity of screen than this laptop (which I bought for Rs. 25K before 5 years)
3. For those who wants to extend the screen for uptop 2 monitors, the given USB C port doesnt support video output so you can only connect one monitor at a time.
4. No option to expand SSD storage as it only supports 512 Gb (which is already included) and no extra SSD slot or even HDD slot.

Can't say:
1. Performace will get tested after heavy usage so will update later
2. Not faced heating issue which will only get tested after heavy usage

Edit:
1) Battery last for 6 to 7 hours while using only excel or any other basic work
2) Good news for GTA 5 lovers as it can run but on low settings. You won't get graphics but game runs smoothly.
3) Has heating issues even after running excel and tally prime"

1389,4.0,Small but best
1390,4.0,Display is quite good in this price. Audio and camera quality is below average. Touch screen is ok. Pen is not included in the box.
1391,4.0,"This is one good looking laptop. It's light, sufficiently powerful to run office and some light apps with email (i use it as a travel machine, so that is all i need to do with it. If i need to do other coding related work i use it to RDP into my work desktop). I recommended this to four other people two of which are students and use it heavily for taking notes, attending classes etc., and i have not heard them complain once. Excellent battery life.

One issue with the newer models is that they don't charge over USB c. My nephew has a older model of the same laptop which charges over USB c. Maybe this is some cost cutting gimick Lenovo has started pulling. Also my laptop shows no indication that it is charging when it is powered off. For my newphews machine, the led is on when it charges. There is also slight light bleed on my lcd from right right edge when the screen is pitch black but for all other laptops this problem doesnt exist. None of these are major issues but please be aware that Lenovo is pulling cost cutting gimicks in the new model.

Overall I would highly recommend this because if you are looking for a small laptop or two in one which is light and portable, there is literally nothing else in market that you can buy in this price range.

Some people use iPad or Android tablets for on the go work but I just could not do it. Bad software support on both (stripped down version of office, no support for wine on Android) and clunkly folio cases with bad keyboard and no mouse pad make tablets a really bad decission for anything other than content consumption and note taking with a stylus. You should only buy a tablet if those are your use cases. This machine though is the best of both worlds. With 7 to 8 hours of battery life it can pretty much couple up as a tablet.

There was a time when this machine used to come with free active stylus. Now, it doesn't. I don't even know if it supports stylus any more, since Lenovo seems to have gone completely silent about it in documentation.

All told if you are looking for a probable laptop to do some light but real work using Microsoft office, obsedian, notion etc. and have budget of twenty K this is what you want to buy. If you are a student with typical student use cases and don't want to play demanding games, again buy this machine. If you want to buy laptops for elders in the house, buy this laptop. Hope this clarifies and helps people make a decission depending on their use case."
1392,4.0,If USB port 3 nos. It more better
1393,4.0,"Good initially,later i will give all details"
1394,4.0,According to prices nice one
1395,4.0,"Initially there are issues with touch screen and windows updates, i have tried lot of things which didn't worked, even a service person didn't done anything, after all these things i have reset the pc. Then it's working normally."
1396,4.0,"I'm going to leave an HONEST REVIEW, I read others, and some people commented about flaws of multitasking, speed being slow etc. etc. I haven't purchased a LENOVO laptop ever in my life, THIS IS MY VERY FIRST LENOVO PURCHASE, so this review is completely UNBIASED....so let me run a detailed review at a price point of about 20k and small ram and storage, I bought this simply for basic purposes (youtube, writing, social media, emails etc.)

Screen: BEAUTIFUL, runs 1080p wonderfully, produces a good picture AND IS TOUCHSCREEN WITH DETACHABLE FEATURE MAKING IT A TABLET!

MultiTasking: I currently have whatsapp running, 8 tabs open in chrome (1 which is facebook, 2 are youtube, 1 is insta etc. and I have edge open) IT IS RUNNING SMOOTHLY. It is a mini powerhouse and is running beautifully

Detachable keyboard: works like a charm and has nice keys, the screen pops in like a puzzle/lego peice

Another beautiful benefit is there's no huge laptop kind of fan / outlet! LESS NOISE! LESS HEAT!

Battery lasts very long 8 hours give or take depending on what you're using it for (videos and streaming naturally will use more battery)

Speakers: On the Standard Size, but it is Tablet like, so that is to be expected, sounds like a standard tablet/mobile phone but audio quality is quite crisp and enhanced, but you won't get surround sound deep bass effect.

It is not meant for gaming, so don't give it aa bad review if it can't run your favorite games, it is a budget laptop that is extremely mobile, extremely portable 2 in 1 type, perfect for web browsing, video watching, email checking, word processing etc. I gave it 5 stars because it met all my requirements and the screen is absolutely beautiful! Runs 1080p videos crystal clear!"

1408,4.0,I think seller is selling used product or refurbished product as in description it is written that product comes with 1 year warranty but when I scan my product for warranty it was showing warranty started in March 2022 and will expire on April 2023 and I have purchased product on 25 September 2022 which means seller is trying to cheat customer buy hiding information or putting wrong description of product

1418,5.0,Very slow. Even some pre-installed apps not opening
1419,5.0,"Value for money don't worry about the Intel Pentium processor it has as it's performance is good for studies and normal video watching.And the battery backup is too good when used for reading pdfs.
The only drawback is the sound which is not that good it needs extra blue tooth speaker while watching video.But for this cost it works decently.Size ofcourse is very handy."
1420,5.0,It's good purchase in this price segment. You will enjoy if you use it in tablet form
1421,5.0,I received this order on 14 Nov 2022. After switching on it heated up within 5 mins. I filed a complain regarding this but they could do anything. Amazon is not giving the option of replace or return. I am regretting after buying this product.i felt helpless I couldn't think what I do now
1422,5.0,Great value for money
1423,5.0,"Looks very beautiful

One issue with the newer models is that they don't charge over USB c. My nephew has a older model of the same laptop which charges over USB c. Maybe this is some cost cutting gimick Lenovo has started pulling. Also my laptop shows no indication that it is charging when it is powered off. For my newphews machine, the led is on when it charges. There is also slight light bleed on my lcd from right right edge when the screen is pitch black but for all other laptops this problem doesnt exist. None of these are major issues but please be aware that Lenovo is pulling cost cutting gimicks in the new model.

Overall I would highly recommend this because if you are looking for a small laptop or two in one which is light and portable, there is literally nothing else in market that you can buy in this price range.

Some people use iPad or Android tablets for on the go work but I just could not do it. Bad software support on both (stripped down version of office, no support for wine on Android) and clunkly folio cases with bad keyboard and no mouse pad make tablets a really bad decission for anything other than content consumption and note taking with a stylus. You should only buy a tablet if those are your use cases. This machine though is the best of both worlds. With 7 to 8 hours of battery life it can pretty much couple up as a tablet.

There was a time when this machine used to come with free active stylus. Now, it doesn't. I don't even know if it supports stylus any more, since Lenovo seems to have gone completely silent about it in documentation.

All told if you are looking for a probable laptop to do some light but real work using Microsoft office, obsedian, notion etc. and have budget of twenty K this is what you want to buy. If you are a student with typical student use cases and don't want to play demanding games, again buy this machine. If you want to buy laptops for elders in the house, buy this laptop. Hope this clarifies and helps people make a decission depending on their use case."
1441,4.0,If USB port 3 nos. It more better
1442,4.0,"Good initially,later i will give all details"
1443,4.0,According to prices nice one
1444,4.0,"Initially there are issues with touch screen and windows updates, i have tried lot of things which didn't worked, even a service person didn't done anything, after all these things i have reset the pc. Then it's working normally."
1445,4.0,"I'm going to leave an HONEST REVIEW, I read others, and some people commented about flaws of multitasking, speed being slow etc. etc. I haven't purchased a LENOVO laptop ever in my life, THIS IS MY VERY FIRST LENOVO PURCHASE, so this review is completely UNBIASED....so let me run a detailed review at a price point of about 20k and small ram and storage, I bought this simply for basic purposes (youtube, writing, social media, emails etc.)

Screen: BEAUTIFUL, runs 1080p wonderfully, produces a good picture AND IS TOUCHSCREEN WITH DETACHABLE FEATURE MAKING IT A TABLET!

MultiTasking: I currently have whatsapp running, 8 tabs open in chrome (1 which is facebook, 2 are youtube, 1 is insta etc. and I have edge open) IT IS RUNNING SMOOTHLY. It is a mini powerhouse and is running beautifully

Detachable keyboard: works like a charm and has nice keys, the screen pops in like a puzzle/lego peice

Another beautiful benefit is there's no huge laptop kind of fan / outlet! LESS NOISE! LESS HEAT!

Battery lasts very long 8 hours give or take depending on what you're using it for (videos and streaming naturally will use more battery)

Speakers: On the Standard Size, but it is Tablet like, so that is to be expected, sounds like a standard tablet/mobile phone but audio quality is quite crisp and enhanced, but you won't get surround sound deep bass effect.

It is not meant for gaming, so don't give it aa bad review if it can't run your favorite games, it is a budget laptop that is extremely mobile, extremely portable 2 in 1 type, perfect for web browsing, video watching, email checking, word processing etc. I gave it 5 stars because it met all my requirements and the screen is absolutely beautiful! Runs 1080p videos crystal clear!"

Before i buy this laptop , I overlooked all the reviews which changed my mind not to buy.

But I need it urgently (and in budget) and fast delivery available i ordered it.

But I am completely satisfied with the purchase.

1. Most review say it's slow and even problem in watching videos. But it's wrong.
Tip: Just update all the drivers and softwares. (Avoid/Turn off window update). Speed will increase by 5x.

2. No heating problem, though i don't play games.

3. Light weight and good looking. Loved the laptop charger similar to macbook charger.

4. Battery backup is definitely very low. Just 2- 2.5 hour backup. Even they mentioned the 4+ hour.

5. Ssd slot is not available. No dvd drive available. Battery is cased inside. No proper graphic card. But everything is memtion on product page.

6. Warranty issue will be resolved by lenovo within 1 days after complaint registration."
1586,2.0,"The laptop is good (so far) but takes a lot of time to boot. I disabled all unnecessary services/applications on startup but still, performance for basic home usage is not up to the mark for this configuration of the laptop purchased. The laptop sometimes becomes nonresponsive and I have to either wait for a few minutes or press hard reboot to resume work. Overall not so satisfactory with this product for this category of laptop."

1589,4.0,"Feeling sorry to write about my worst experience with Amazon which I never expected to happen
On 27th April I raised a concern that laptop is very slow and hanging and there is a problem in hard disk( This was verified by amazon laptop set up service engineer)
The customer care executive said that they will arrange for the inspection on 30 april and based on inspection result you will get an replacement before 4th May and she also added that by 3 pm on 30th April she will call me but she did not call me
Today the technician did the health check up of the laptop and found it was slow and there was a problem in hard drive as when he was doing the disk drive diagnosis the screen was only loading for 20 mins and did not fetch any results but in the screen it was return that u should get the results in 3-10 mins and then technician told me there is a problem in hard disk and the laptop needs to be replaced
But to my surprise when I contacted the customer care they are telling that the technician has mentioned in the report that everything is fine, And when I asked the executive to share the technician report with me she is not doing it, Instead is raising a 2nd inspection for my laptop
I am unable to understand that whether the technician is giving a false commitment to me or Amazon is giving a false commitment by not being transparent enough to share the report
I called to the technician after calling to customer care and recorded the call as a proof that technician told me that there is problem in laptop and technician also went in saying that Amazon team will fully denies the laptop replacement
I am in a very deep sorrow that a company like Amazon can do all this, I'm confused wheather to believe the technician or Amazon
screen shot of laptop disk diagnosis and technician call recording is available with me and can be produced anytime
I hope my complaint is taken seriously and I get the laptop replaced immediately"

a] it gets switched on very slowly at times, so much so that it takes 30 minutes to open, even after that once logged in all the apps you will try to open will show not responding [ this always happen]
b] the battery is very bad, with a full charge it will work for 2-3 hours max and if you are someone who works for long hours, prefer not to go for this one, as even the charging rate is poor.

I am not someone who writes a review, but it felt like a necessity that people should about these 2 major flaws if they planning to spend 40,000 [ approx] on this laptop which is not a less amount."

1610,3.0,Useless with good looks. Never buy Lenovo it’s cheating customers hard earned money. Good configuration-8gb Ram/1TBHdd/ windows 11/2 yrs warranty BUT laptop just donot work and is fit for dustbin and company Lenovo& seller Amazon not accepting its replacement/ refund. Lenovo technical team ( esupport) has examined it and described it an incompatible HDD with windows 11 although 8gb Ram. That’s why it does not work properly and slow like tortoise speed. And have advised to put an upgraded SsD of at least 512gb or 1Tb to make it a working machine and cost be born by customer.Disgusting and most regrettable state of affair of the Lenovo company . Never buy Lenovo product. It’s useless and cheating company . Why a customer should suffer for company’s deficiency and defective product sold with wrong and incompatible configuration. I will take them to consumer forum and fight legally for cheating and misrepresentation . You must own your defects in product and serviceability for the unseeable product. Lenovo just cannot make fool of innocent customers who are buying online just on the basis of properties & configrations shown wile selling the product. Amazon also cannot be absolved of its responsibility fom cheating of customers hard earned money by selling defective and useless and non working products and not accepting returns and refunds.sjs soni

1681,5.0,The product is little larger in size since it has the dedicated number keys in the side. The performance of the laptop is toooooooo slow. I haven't seen such slowness in my life. If you open a browser it will take 5 minutes to open the page (even though the network is strong). I strongly recommend not to buy this product.

Performance as it is can be termed as very good
Ms Office home , norton antivirus is pre installed without license so you have to purchase a license key additionally if you wish to use these beyond the trial period of a few days
I am totally disappointed not for the performance but because I like to be in full control of the device which in this case is not possible so only 2 stars for the product as it boots up and shuts down as expected off an ssd.

After 2 days of struggle I called acer service to make it possible to boot from usb devices and the service person visited and whatever he tried (mostly changes in bios security settings) simply made the pre loaded win 11 also non bootable and not repairable, as per my habit I had a rescue disk already made out of the installed system and a backup image prepared from the win 11 in spite of which the operating system remained useless and I had to go back to a fresh install of windows 10 from my own win 10 install media and then upgrade to win 11.
After 2 months :
After lot many tries I've found out that fedora 34 onwards can be installed from usb drives on this hardware and may be other uefi compatible ones too may get working on it. The performance is fine so I am increasing the rating from 2 to 4 stars now, 1 star less for absence of ""caps lock, num lock, BT etc. "" indicators on kbd and a narrow viewing angle for the quality FHD (1920 X 1080) resolution ."

1781,5.0,"I am a linux guy, so after I brought this laptop (16gb) spending 53k on festive season, simply installed Debian on new partition. Found that, hardware is so new that the os can't find it.

If you are an average user and willing to use linux you can try linux mint which works perfectly including its graphics card. No issue at all.

I knew that the battery backup will not be much more so I am not going to complain here - getting approx 3 hours plus by browsing and coding (not compiling)

Good: speed: performance is super. very fast and responsive.

Problem 1: keyboard color: on daylight if you don't look the keyboard vertically which you wont - will not be able to read letters written in keys. - very bad. I have enabled keyboard light always on from bios. typing is not so good or bad.

Problem 2: touchpad: in windows and linux both - touchpad lags for couple of seconds very now and then. Trust me - this is not a user created issue. It might be the touchpad hardware issue (not Acer's fault) or software (firmware / kernel) issue presents in Windows and Linux both. Its been more than a year now (talking about touchpad hardware, not the laptop).

Problem 3: screen bleed: very little screen bleed in the screen. I can live with that.

Tips: In bios if you cant see any option to change touchapd driver, for example ps/2 or advance mode - press ""ctrl + s"" and few new options will be available for that session."
1782,1.0,"This acer laptop gives good performance without any doubt. For light works, this much weighing laptop is not necessary. This much performance is also not necessary. Go for 14"" ones. I expect acer to manufacture this same laptop with 13-14"" screen to get good battery backup. 15.6"" laptops drain so much battery for no reason. Also, Windows has become battery hungry.

Ratings:
Battery = 3/5
Screen = 3/5
Processor = 4/5
Ready from Boot = 4/5
Sound = 2/5
Weight = 3/5

Pros:
1. Good processor i5-1240p
2. Thunderbolt port
3. Typing is good. Got Number pad too.
4. Fast charging
5. Sound Quality is good
6. Brightness is good
7. No fan sound. It is quiet, surprisingly (for me .!!)
5. Received a sealed piece (thanks to amazon)

Cons:
1. Low sound output. You should put the laptop on a table or pad to get reasonable sound output.
2. Low battery backup for heavy works, just 2-3 hrs or even less. Android Studio works just for 2 hrs only. You can get away with 5hrs with light works for sure.
3. Display Contrast is not good.
4. Key colors are really bad. It is very difficult to spot keys suddenly. If you don't know typing, it wastes lot of time. Black color is the preferred one. I want to see the engineer who designed it :("
1783,5.0,search Realtek audio console then select movie mode by default it is in music mode gives low output by choosing movie mode sound output is increased
1784,2.0,"Weightless laptop Looking nice
Battery backup: once charge 100% continually we can work 4hr only
Speakers no big sound comming, it will come very less sound"
1785,5.0,"Screen quality is good. I prefer watching some of the shows on my laptop.

Performance is good enough. Never faced any lags with VS Code and multiple tabs open in Firefox.

Backup could last anywhere between 3-5 hrs. If you have wi-fi on then the battery drains much faster. Screen brightness also affects battery backup.

GPU is kind of disappointed because it is actually weaker than the GTX 1650 (the 50 watt varient). Rtx 2050 is only of 35 watts and hence performs worse that GTX 1650.

Ram is in dual channel. Both slots are occupied.

This laptop also has a problem with electric leakage. The upper corners of lid while charging give out electric shocks. It has only happened twice in two months but now I have to be wary of that.

Touchpad is nice I have always liked gestures that come with it. It did felt very rough at first but was smooth after 2-3 days.

Camera is on par with what you expect in a laptop. You will be able to recognise yourself and that is enough.

To conclude, everything is about alright except the GPU. If only it were of 50 watts this would have been a perfect laptop. It's not bad but just disappointing."
1786,5.0,Overall Laptop is really good but fan noice is so much

1789,4.0,"The product description says the CPU Speed is 3.3 GHZ but the product received is having 1.70GHZ clock speed
Really Disappointed. Trying my best to sort this out. But I was helpless by Both Amazon and Acer.
Guys don't buy this product because the spec mentioned on the website is not included in the Product you receive even if you request for Replacement again same product will be Received. Be careful guys, Try your best to visit the showroom for purchasing Laptops. That is Highly Recommended. than purchasing via Online Website. To get resolve the issue u need to suffer a lot. Better Choose Offline Showroom."

Processer good

1794,5.0," Cons:
- Feels too heavy if you are used to a 14 inch laptop
- Keyboard and bottom panel get heated up even when not being used for CPU intensive tasks. Not comfortable to use type when keyboard get hot.
- No MS Office
- 4GB + 4GB RAM (16GB version is not available in Amazon): 4GB will be waste when upgrading.
- Stupid warranty sticker over screw, which screws the self upgrade option.
- White letters on light coloured keyboard: Hard to read letters.
- Touchpad could have been smoother.
- Poor battery backup (really).
- Too much visibility of inside boards and heat rods through vents in bottom lid.

Pros:
- Slim and sleek design.
- RTX 2050, i5 12 gen.
- Thunderbolt port.
- Good display.
- Price range.

Recommended to purchase extended 2 year warranty (1 + 2) from Acer (Available for < 2k)"

Likes:

Dislikes
1) Very low sound. It is worst than my mobile phone sound
2) MS office not available (while most laptop at this price range provides pre-installed)
3) Screen size/color/performance appears inadequate for gaming and for some applications
4) 2*4GB RAM in two slots, would have to waste one if we need to upgrade RAM

Overall I would say you can find better deals than this laptop. I will need to ask acer support on the laptop speaker to see if it is defective or is it by design."

My usage of office related and not specifically gaming and this laptop provides me with the ease in doing both! Bought the 8GB RAM variant. Can't upgrade to 16GB yet or I'll be voiding the warranty. If you need 16, buy the 16GB variant.. Also, You might wanna check the nearest Acer Service centre from your location in case there's an issue with the product some day or warranty claims.

Only issue is with the keyboard visibility. In bright lights, you won't be able to see the key markings when light reflects off the keys."
1804,4.0,sound from speakers is bit low overall good
1805,4.0,"I boght this laptop for mainly multitasking and virtualization purpose, 16GB version was not available so bought 8 GB version(4x2), then I upgraded it to 32 GB crucial RAM, overall super performance and smooth no lags, installed linux alongside windows, NVMe PCIe gen 3 SSD provided and speed is also good see the speedtest image attached, I bought it for around Rs 52K after bank discount and old laptop exchange offer

here are the pros and cons of this laptop
Pros:
1) 12th gen CPU 1240P, 12 cores/16 threads ( total 16 Virtual processors).
2) Total 2 NVMe slots, 1st slot is PCIe gen 4 NVMe supported, 2nd slot PCIe gen 3).
3) backlit keyboard
4) Thunderbolt 4 supported
5) NVidia RTX 2050 with this price is worth
6) Fingerprint scan is fast

Cons:

1814,5.0,Hi
1815,4.0,"The laptop is good for this price point.
First Day review.
1) Noticed that in multi core performance mode the max cpu frequency was around 2.57Ghz. I think this might be some bios issue. Where as in single core mode cpu runs at its full clock speed (4.1Ghz).
2) The laptop fan has zero noise at low load and when cpu runs at its high clock speed the noise is a bit loud (not very loud).
3) R23 cinebench single core :1657
multi core : 6200
4)Speakers and battery backup are mediocre.
5) Ram 4+4 GB ok dual channel, better than single 8 GB but problem upgrading wise.

After 3 days ( installing windows updates and drivers)
1) cinebench multicore test : 8500 pts.
2) single core : 1650 pts
3) Battery backup increased to 4-5 hrs. (good battery life)
4)Thermals are outstanding max 75°C (during 4-5 hr stretch)
5) Loving this laptop so far."

Fast forward two days, and no one showed up, so I called Amazon again. They are now saying that technicians will come only after 4-5 days.
So I'm sitting here with my brand new laptop, over 2 hours of phonecalls with Amazon and acer, a horrible ownership experience and alot of misinformation.
The only thing the amazon technician was focused on was a ""feedback form"" for the quality of service he provided over the phone.
Be careful, go to a physical store, check the product and then buy it. Do not fall prey to ""refund/replacement"" options by Amazon. They will make you run around in circles.

1830,5.0,"I am a linux guy, so after I brought this laptop (16gb) spending 53k on festive season, simply installed Debian on new partition. Found that, hardware is so new that the os can't find it.

If you are an average user and willing to use linux you can try linux mint which works perfectly including its graphics card. No issue at all.

I knew that the battery backup will not be much more so I am not going to complain here - getting approx 3 hours plus by browsing and coding (not compiling)

Good: speed: performance is super. very fast and responsive.

Problem 1: keyboard color: on daylight if you don't look the keyboard vertically which you wont - will not be able to read letters written in keys. - very bad. I have enabled keyboard light always on from bios. typing is not so good or bad.

Problem 2: touchpad: in windows and linux both - touchpad lags for couple of seconds very now and then. Trust me - this is not a user created issue. It might be the touchpad hardware issue (not Acer's fault) or software (firmware / kernel) issue presents in Windows and Linux both. Its been more than a year now (talking about touchpad hardware, not the laptop).

Problem 3: screen bleed: very little screen bleed in the screen. I can live with that.

Tips: In bios if you cant see any option to change touchapd driver, for example ps/2 or advance mode - press ""ctrl + s"" and few new options will be available for that session."
1831,4.0,"This acer laptop gives good performance without any doubt. For light works, this much weighing laptop is not necessary. This much performance is also not necessary. Go for 14"" ones. I expect acer to manufacture this same laptop with 13-14"" screen to get good battery backup. 15.6"" laptops drain so much battery for no reason. Also, Windows has become battery hungry.

Ratings:
Battery = 3/5
Screen = 3/5
Processor = 4/5
Ready from Boot = 4/5
Sound = 2/5
Weight = 3/5

Pros:
1. Good processor i5-1240p
2. Thunderbolt port
3. Typing is good. Got Number pad too.
4. Fast charging
5. Sound Quality is good
6. Brightness is good
7. No fan sound. It is quiet, surprisingly (for me .!!)
5. Received a sealed piece (thanks to amazon)

Cons:
1. Low sound output. You should put the laptop on a table or pad to get reasonable sound output.
2. Low battery backup for heavy works, just 2-3 hrs or even less. Android Studio works just for 2 hrs only. You can get away with 5hrs with light works for sure.
3. Display Contrast is not good.
4. Key colors are really bad. It is very difficult to spot keys suddenly. If you don't know typing, it wastes lot of time. Black color is the preferred one. I want to see the engineer who designed it :("
1832,5.0,search Realtek audio console then select movie mode by default it is in music mode gives low output by choosing movie mode sound output is increased
1833,4.0,"Weightless laptop Looking nice
Battery backup: once charge 100% continually we can work 4hr only
Speakers no big sound comming, it will come very less sound"
1834,5.0,"Screen quality is good. I prefer watching some of the shows on my laptop.

Performance is good enough. Never faced any lags with VS Code and multiple tabs open in Firefox.

Backup could last anywhere between 3-5 hrs. If you have wi-fi on then the battery drains much faster. Screen brightness also affects battery backup.

GPU is kind of disappointed because it is actually weaker than the GTX 1650 (the 50 watt varient). Rtx 2050 is only of 35 watts and hence performs worse that GTX 1650.

Ram is in dual channel. Both slots are occupied.

This laptop also has a problem with electric leakage. The upper corners of lid while charging give out electric shocks. It has only happened twice in two months but now I have to be wary of that.

Touchpad is nice I have always liked gestures that come with it. It did felt very rough at first but was smooth after 2-3 days.

Camera is on par with what you expect in a laptop. You will be able to recognise yourself and that is enough.

To conclude, everything is about alright except the GPU. If only it were of 50 watts this would have been a perfect laptop. It's not bad but just disappointing."

1879,5.0," Laptop CPU runs hot. Windows11/HP/AMD background software keeps cpu working at 30-40% even at idle. But right when you launch task manager to see which process is taking up so much CPU resources, these processes stop right away and you can't even figure out what processes were running. Suddenly the processor load is at 1 or 2% instead of 30-40%. Something is going on with Windows11. My issue was this background shenanigans kept the CPU/Laptop hot. Even at 30% CPU load, temperature can get near 100C. So what I do now is always keep task manager running, this keeps the unnecessary background processes stopped and lets my CPU be cool when idle. To monitor CPU load and also temperature a software called CoreTemp can be used. Essential if your CPU is being used/hijacked by some unnecessary process which hides itself in the Windows Task manager like in my case.

edit: Used a third party software called Anvir taskmanager and found windows explorer was keeping the cpu at 33% load even when idle, making the CPU temperature reach 100C for no reason. So just restarting the explorer in taskmanager fixed the issue.

Initially without any clue as to what was happening, I had to re-paste the CPU/GPU thermal paste, try out a third-party software to control AMD Ryzen temperature. More about that below. Also figured out HP factory setup for the laptop back panel had a plastic sheet which was covering up a huge air vent. So make sure to discard plastic sheet if you are planning to game and want to keep the laptop as cool as possible.

I like my laptop to stay sort of cool even when gaming, so it lasts long and I don't have to worry about replacing it's fan sooner.

I re-pasted the CPU and GPU with some Cooler Master MasterGel Pro Thermal Paste. When I opened up the thermal heat sink metal plate, there were two kinds of paste, grey on CPU/GPU and white on some other chips. The white paste is a silicon based paste called CLG-3500 the name you can find in the Maintenance and Service guide for this laptop on HP website. I left the white paste there, it's of lower thermal conductivity so basically lower quality than mastergel. I filled some gaps on it with my higher thermal conducting Mastergel paste, a few drops here and there. These chips are of lower importance in generating heat when compared to CPU/GPU and also Mastergel paste does not conduct electricity. For CPU GPU I cleaned out entire factory applied grey thermal paste with some iso alcohol/cloth and then repasted with my Mastergel paste. The mastergel/thermal paste only conducts heat to metal plate and it's upto the fans/ventilation to remove it from metal plates.

HP factory setting for this laptop blocks the main air vent on the back panel of the laptop with some kind of plastic/paper sheet thing. You can see attached pics. Don't know why HP would block a huge air vent they made themselves for their gaming laptop with a plastic sheet. This air vent sits right on top of the heat conducting metal plate and so opening this up would conduct away most of the heat from the metal plate easily, letting the laptop run cooler more easily and letting the laptop fan do less work and thus last longer. Any plans to use a laptop cooler stand with built in fans would be more effective if the back panel had lots of holes on it for cooler air to flow in. An MSi bravo laptop that I considered with same processor and graphics card as this HP victus has a backpanel that exposes most of it's metal plates to air easily with lots of holes. I initially thought this HP model also had air vents from the few pics could find earlier but only found it was blocked once I got it in my hand. So I plucked out this blocking sheet right out of the backpanel and now my airvents are fully open exposing the hot metal plate. I made a DIY laptop stand with a USB table fan and an inverted plastic box with a big hole for the fan to sit in. I put the fan inside the box and the laptop on top of the box so that the fan blows air right at the air vent/metal heat sink plate.

With this set up I am able to keep my laptop cool when gaming heavy. I ran God of War game at high graphic settings, which made my CPU consume 80-90Watts and GPU 70-80 watts and produce maximum heat, CPU went to 101 C and GPU to 90C. The frames per second for GOW game was good at 40-65fps in closed settings and slightly laggy in rare occassions. But since I repasted the CPU/GPU, my laptop backpanel air vent was fully open and I also put a table fan blowing air into the metal heat sink ... over all the laptop body was cool underside and slightly warm to touch on keyboard regardless of whether the CPU/GPU was hot. Also monitored the laptop CPU fan speed using Speedfan 4.52 software. The maximum speed is around 4800 rpm (OMEN software can force CPU fan to maximum speed). while idle it's around 2200 rpm without external fan and 0 rpm with external fan. While gaming with my current set up and an external fan, the cpu fan speed is around 3800 to 4000 rpm. It never reaches the maximum speed because over all laptop is cool even when CPU is hot.

For experts who know about TDP and want to control CPU wattage and temperature directly, there are two softwares, one is Ryzen controller and other is AMD APU Tuning Utility. Both use another program called RyzenAdj.exe which can directly change certain parameters of the Ryzen CPUs. For this Ryzen 5600H cpu, the max TDP power value it can operate at is around 113 Watts. The max temperature it can operate at is around 100C. Both are factory set and can be found using command line interface with Ryzenadj software. So using one of these softwares Ryzenadj, Ryzen controller or AMD APU Tuning Utility, you can set these values during a user session. For example you can decrease the maximum wattage allowed from 113 to 50 watts and maximum temperature can be decreased from 100C to say 70C. With these new values, the Ryzen 5600h CPU will not be able to use more power or will not be allowed to heat up beyond the set value. These settings are always reset upon restart of the laptop provided you do not apply it again. So I used these softwares to try to decrease my laptop temperature. For idle/not gaming setting, I would use a temperature limit of 70C and the CPU would never cross this value. You can also use these softwares to set temperature or TDP wattage values while gaming. For example a setting I used was not allow temperature to cross above 80C and not allow TDP to cross above 75W. Only one of these values will take precedence over the other, probably the temperature one because CPU heats up really fast even with 30% load. Played a lot using these settings and was able to get good 40-60 fps in Racing game Dirt 5 in high medium mix graphic settings on a heavy rain race track simulating most weather and graphic effects. The CPU temperature never crossed 80-81C. GPu temperature reached near 80C but this cannot be controlled directly by these softwares, only can change and control CPU values. If lacking a Laptop cooling stand and external fan, I would use these softwares to decrease laptop temperature but otherwise it's not necessary.

Laptop monitor lacks color, Recommend installing latest AMD radeon drivers and AMD Adrenalin software. I increased the saturation of my monitor. AMD Adrenalin software also has a vivid setting for global display/graphics. Use that to show more colorful display and in game .

The Laptop graphics card has 4GB vram which can affect high texture graphics required for some games. Some games like dirt 5 or forza 5 gives vram low warnings. Still for Dirt 5 graphics is pretty great. For Forza 5 it could use a bit improvement. Forza 4 runs great and has great graphics though. Though at this price point this laptop is good , most 6GB vram laptops are selling at way higher prices. I would recommend a high 6GB VRAM graphic card rather than a Nvidia 3050 as an improvement over this rx 5500m

Also recommend getting another 8GB RAM as it would add more to gaming and multi tasking experience. I installed two 16 Gb rams to have total 32GB and everything works great, switches programs on the fly, from gaming to work instantly. Some rare games like God of war and Modern warfare warzone battle royale used more than 16 GB ram, up to 20GB. For most other games 16GB should be more than enough.

edit: tried out several games, all action adventure and racing games available for xbox gaming pass and EA play subscription . Over all the impression is this laptop is good for gaming at 1920 x 1080 resolution with greater than 40 fps minimum at high graphic settings. It can go to ultra graphics for games released before 2020. One issue I found was when gaming long hours, the battery seems to be discharging at a slow but significant rate even when power cable was connected. The issue could be either laptop or my home's power lines. No idea.

edit2:
Due to modifying my laptop cpu's power settings using third party sw, or due to unlocking and using windows ultimate performance/high performance power plans in windows power options, one of those two reasons, Maybe not these reasons at all, but anyway my cpu and gpu together are consuming more than 150 watts that the power brick can provide and this is what is causing the battery drainage when I play games for over 5 to 6 hours continuously. So I now limit the cpu power limit to around 78W using ryzen controller sw. Rest of the power from power brick is reserved for graphics card. This resolves the battery draining problem I was having and I am still able to play games at more or less same quality, speed and graphics. Constant draining and recharging would be bad for battery life. This makes it seem like the cpu and gpu of this laptop could have performed greater if it were provided a 200W power brick."
1880,5.0,"Works really well if you debloat your Windows 11. Only problem I encounter is that WiFi disconnects sometime and I have to uninstall the device from Device manager and then refresh again. Haven't enountered this problem on Fedora Linux yet, so it seems to be a Win11 issue.

Screen Wobble is manageable, you night have to change the screen angle as fan can make it wobble.

Keyboard is not good, but I guess that's the problem with every laptop membrane keyboard.

Windows 11 secure boot compulsion is annoying for anyone looking to distro hop.

Linux support is good."
1881,4.0,"Starting with the Bad thing
1) Screen Shake, while it is under average or high-speed fan it will strongly hit when you are a 1st-time laptop owner
2) Keyboard backlight brightness adjustment not there
3) NO CAMERA SHUTTER

NOW GOOD PART
1) BIG SCREEN
2) DYNAMIC LOOK ESPECIALLY IN BLACK COLOUR
3) Windows 11
4) Battery Life is good for gaming guys but for the casual user battery life is more awesome
5) Almost all needy ports are there
6) dual fan with proper function adjustment which helps to reduce the temperature
7) So many +points are there about this product"
1882,5.0,"Packaging was PATHETIC just pathetic .
Just the amazon cover over the hp box , no cushioning, just one hit and my laptop would have gone .

Now about the product ,
It is my initial review after using 2 days .
I am gonna tell about the cons here.
First thing first ,it is damn heavy .
IT DISCONNECTED WIFI TWICE ,I had to restart my pc (very bad wifi stick used).
It has minor backlit bleed at the top corner (ingnorable)
BATTERY: honestly speaking I expected more battery back that is the reason I had gone with victus not pavallion .disappointed here.
Will test more .

UPDATE : Attached some pictures of backlight bleeding 1st at 100 percent brightness and second at 50 percent brightness . It really feels cheap now .one star removed from review . Stay tuned ."
1883,4.0,"Bought this in December 2021, when I was on a lookout for a new laptop to edit videos on. I chose a gaming laptop since the hardware suitable for such task is only available on gaming machines in this category and budget. I had done my research which told me that video rendering is mostly a CPU-heavy task and there was very little difference between NVIDIA and AMD GPUs. It was my mistake to believe it. Premiere Pro doesn't officially support AMD Radeon 5500M, though its latest version does support hardware encoding with AMD GPU, but I still feel a lack of performance. If you want to further your interests with After Effects and Blender, then it is totally not an ideal GPU currently. Better to go with similarly specced NVIDIA model.

Other big pet peeve is that the Realtek WiFi card stops working once in a while, needing to restart the computer or disable and reenable the card from Windows Device Manager. Very frustrating, especially if you're in middle of a call or a transaction. I don't know if it's a driver or hardware issue. I waited for a software update all this time, but will go to the service center and get the card replaced now. Even the GPU drivers from HP are mismatch and Radeon Software was not behaving properly with the stock drivers.

Despite the configuration, the weight is a bit too much, makes it a pain to carry around. And the 16 inch screen size didn't feel like a big increment from 15.6 perhaps because of the aspect ratio.

No complaints on gaming front, everything runs smoothly, the GPU gets to do its work pretty well there. The battery drains quickly under medium to heavy loads though."
1884,5.0,"I m writing this review after 1 month. Well, the laptop is good but battery backup is of 6 hrs it is consuming 15 percent in an hour."
1885,5.0,"Good HP Laptop with this price Range. It is working good as per its configuration. Feel more weight compare to my Lenovo. But keypad and other functions are excellent. The only issue frequently I am facing is, Wi-Fi disconnection. There is frequent wi-fi disconnections are there. Finally I changed few settings and then now its working fine. Overall it is good and powerful laptop from HP."
1886,3.0,"Review after 2 day
Laptop is just owsome and battery life is also very good 6.5 to 7+ hours of battery backup when battery saver is on all the time . Firstly i got only 5 hours backup without battery backup which is bad. But now i am fully satisfied with this laptop and its battery. If you are concerned with battery then then this is the best battery gaming powerful laptop under 60000. Btw got it 48000"
1887,3.0,"I was initially happy to get this. I did upgrade the RAM to 16 GB because 8 GB was too slow for me.
Even after upgrade of RAM, I feel the laptop lags at times and I think it is because of Windows 11 which is crap in my opinion. Overall an okish laptop for the price.

Pros are Windows 11 licensed edition along with Microsoft Office lifetime license. Processor is decent enough. Price was decent got at 50k package. Gets windows update frequently.
Cons are Battery life is so bad at times gives 1.30 hrs for processor-intensive tasks and 4 hours plus for normal web browsing. Wifi keeps getting disconnected at times, not sure if this is an issue with Windows 11 or the hardware but disabling driver and enabling fixes the issue, so looks like a driver issue somehow.
Screen wobbles if you are carrying that is not a big issue as long as you are not running with it the screen open."
1888,3.0,Apart from camera side and also 60hz refresh rate this peice is master blaster

1890,3.0,"The good: -
(1) looks good and has a good ventilation.
(2) performance is very snappy.
(3) good battery life for very basic use like Microsoft excel. It lasts 6-7 hrs on it.
(4) charges fast.
(5) keyboard algorithm is very good and the toughpad is big and very useful.

The bad and the ugly:
(1) 100% of battery will only last 20-30mins max on gaming. And so you have to keep it plugged.
(2) power on the laptop and launch the game immediately and the game will lag/stutter for 10mins. Idk why... Even i upgraded the ram to 16gb.
(3) built quality is descent but the plastic edges may hurt yo sometimes.
(4) screen wobble may annoy you.
(5) screen bleed is ugly.
(6) sound quality is good but B&O but the volume is very low.. Bottom firing speakers with pure treble. Not even a trace of beats in the sound signature... Not idk for what reason the audio output from aux is very poor.. Mono like sound... With no bass!.
(7) will not be a good choice for Gaming as the performance fluctuates while gaming."
1891,4.0,"I got one with dead pixels so I requested for replacement. They arranged inspection twice but no one came for inspection and they marked as inspection completed. I contacted with amazon customer care, they registered compliant against them and processed my replacement. After a painfull process they finally replaced it. They were very polite.
Screen wobbling vary from laptop to laptop. The previous one i got had tight hinges and didn't wobble at all. But the one I have now have wobbling issue If i sit under fan.
It wobble only under fan or cooler.
I use it in power saving mode with 0 brightness with 7-8 tabs open in browser, vs code, android studio.
It gives me 6 to 8 hours battery backup. And when i only watch videos it gives me 9 hours backup.
I haven't tried gaming on it so cant say about that.
If you want good battery backup then always use it in battery saver mode."
1892,5.0,If you're not a beginner gamer then go for it. It is a beast😈😈
1893,5.0,"Laptop is ok
But i had some problems with warranty
The delivery agent is very very careless
Product came in broken outside cover
But Laptop cover is ok
Delivery agent was very rude."
1894,2.0,"Features are great but a lot heavy to carry anywhere or put it on your lap , heating issue is there , these two significant cons otherwise a great laptop."
1895,2.0,Not for high end gaming or gaming for long durations.
1896,5.0,"Overall a good product. Go for it without any doubts! Performance is best, no major issues encountered.
Their is some glitch in wifi connectivity but restarting once will get it on the line and works perfectly for weeks together without this issue.
Pros- 1. Best for Engineers especially designers and mechanical domain which have heavy softwares.
2. Free windows 11 and MS office makes it a great deal.
3. 12cores are great for quick tasks.
4. Graphic card is decent. All rendering tasks are quick and without screenlag

Cons-
Add-on RAM or SSD is required as the basic one will be short for heavy softwares.

Go for it if the pricing is less than 61K"
1897,1.0,"This laptop never disappointed me in any aspect leaving its 2.25 kg weight. Its look, performance, display, charging and speakers good for me as this is my first lap. It is overall a year completed. Still victus lap is working awesome in all aspects. It is a laptop for those who need a laptop with a gaming features but with student lap looks 🙂. I love this laptop simply"
1898,5.0,Nice product.
1899,1.0,"Since it's an entry-level gaming laptop, that said it's understandable that it's bulky and the screen refresh rate is 60hz which you are going to see in lots of reviews. Btw I am posting this review after using this laptop for 3 months now.

So first let's talk about some of the graphic intensive games and their fps: - in all games, I have locked fps to 60hz so it might be higher for some games.

1. The Witcher 3 (ultra) : 60fps
2. Destiny2 (high): 60fps
3. The Division 2 (ultra) : 51-59 fps
4. The Crew 2 (high) : 45 fps avg.
5. RDR 2 (high - this is the highest setting i can apply because of limited vRAM) : 40 - 45 fps

the only thing which I don't like is that the bottom heat sink is not quite raised, so if I don't raise the laptop a little bit from the back the temp touched 100 degrees even though the fans are running at max speed.

I also faced an issue installing the AMD software: adrenalin edition which its equivalent to Geforce experience, so I cannot do the fine-tuning or optimizing to some of the games which are built for AMD graphics.

All other features are absolute above par compared to the price -
1. Battery ( i think this would be the usp for this laptop),
2. Speakers are great depending on what you are listening (it's loud for the music but for gaming and streaming movies it's not that great ).
3. Not RGB backlit keyboard - which I really want no RGB BS.
4. You can expect 6 core cpu (3.10 ghz boost) in this price segment in the gaming laptop - all thanks to AMD
5. Radeon Rx 5500M which beats the gtx 1650 and 1650ti at the lower price.

All in all, there are few cons that come with this laptop which are not worth mentioning because this is a budget laptop, and to reduce the cost they have to definitely compromise in some ways. So as compared to other gaming laptops in this price segment this would definitely beat the others.

For me, this laptop is meeting my day-to-day requirements as of now."
1900,2.0,This laptop disconnects wifi connection without intimation. Screen beelding issue. The major problem that i have faced in this laptop
1901,5.0,Delivered on time very good packaging by amazon product looks and feels sturdy will post a complete review after using it for about a month
1902,5.0, Satisfied with the product battery life is good 5to6 hours and multitasking 3t04 hours display quality is very good pure ips not thats cheap ips level panel that's why I bought this laptop there's a lot of gaming laptop comes with ips level panels that's it
1903,1.0,"The seller sent HP Victus Ryzen 7 with gtx1650 instead of Ryzen 5 with Rx5500m, i had to get a replacement for the right model, amazon delivered both the original order and replacement order withing two days and both laptops were of good quality, whole review and replacement process took about 10 days. comparing the two i would say Ryzen 5 model is equally good in multitasking and everyday usage and twice as good in gaming! this made me appreciate this laptop even more.

battery life is good enough.
restarts in about 10 seconds!
keyboard is nice to type on.
1080p 60hz screen is really good for watching multimedia and webpage text are CRISP!
webcam is good enough, has wide angle.
build quality is good, all plastic but seems to be durable, hopefully the hinges will stay good.
windows 11 OS.
trackpad is reasonably good. click buttons could have been better but that is how most laptops are these days, its about average.

my laptop has backlight bleeding issue, only during black screen bootup or restart i can see yellowish light bleed, but once it finishes booting up i don't see it anymore and even on black background i dont see it, i guess its acceptable and not and issue in my case

a 90hr screen for this gaming laptop would have been good to have and the gpu is capable of pushing 90fps on medium graphics that would have made this laptop flawless! probably overclocking the scrren to 75hr might help or buying a high refresh rate monitor would be better. other than that zero complaints and this is the best laptop you can ever buy for 55k in 2022. i got this for 42k after exchanging old laptop.

overall very happy with the laptop, does everything i need.
good for gaming, so far played battlefield v, never went below 60fps on highest ultra settings (game was locked at 60fps max) if i have to guess the max fps would be around 80fps for this game when plugged in. Rx5500m is a really good GPU! :)"
1904,2.0,"using it since a month, this is an amazing machine. Got it in 48000.
i am using it in all possible ways. sometimes play games in it, never lagged a bit.
i am using it professionally also great typing experience .
for the maximum time i open two browsers and minimum 4-5 tabs in each browser never got any problem.
if this laptop falls under your budget definitely go for it.
i cant compare it with other laptops as in this budget i wasnt getting any other laptop with simmilar specs."
1905,5.0,"I received 2 days ago.... fabulous product.

Pros.- • Internally very strong
(CPU,GPU,RAM,SSD, Wireless system...)
• Loud and clear speakers
• Display colour optimization
• Professional looks

Cons.-• Camera is 👎👎(but considering gaming
laptop... ok)
• There is no battery charging
limiter upto 80%.(It has only some regular battery health care feature)

**Display sharpness is average (Same 1920×1080 is used in large 16.1 inch display).
70 Whr battery life is good (7-8 hrs in normal use).This dude is heavy....
But everything is justified looking at the performance.Who else gives this much in this price (I bought at 51k ... including bank discount)....Super purchase😇😇
Just go for it...."

1908,2.0,"I got this laptop @ 47k in BBD. My laptop had screen bleeding issue so requested for replacement and amazon delivered new laptop within 2 days. New one doesn't have any bleeding issues.
Everything is good in this laptop, except camera and cpu temperature reaches 90℃ while playing games. If you want to play games use cooling pad.
Bhai koi bhi agar laptop le rhe ho to screen bleeding test aur dead pixel test jaroor krna.
Agar sirf gaming ke liye hi lena hai to is range me jo dusre laptops hain unka gaming test jaroor compare krna."
1909,5.0,"Update after 1 week:

Battery is good for professional use: MS Word, 5-8 PDFs, Edge browser, WhatsApp app.

Display is slightly yellow in tone. Didn't test outside.

Speakers are good for internals and it will work.

There is some hanging issue when I click on battery icon or when I go in a folder and right click. Then the mouse hangs for 1 - 2 seconds.

There is ZERO heating issues for a professional use. I can even use on my lap for some time.

Screen wobble is ZERO in my case. I believe I received a good unit. Haha. It is normal wobble that you will even see in MacBook also.

Screen opens with single hand is a beautiful feature.

Will update review after 1 month now.

Everything looks perfect in terms of specifications mentioned on product.

Dislikes:
Screen wobbles too much even from the fan air.
Not satisfied with the performance.
Battery draining so fast.
Cpu and Gpu getting so much heat even when normal usage.
Takes too much time to load all the applications on windows screen once powered ON.
Wifi getting disconnected frequently.
Camera not at all good quality.
Sound wise it gives average sound.
Sometimes task manager itself is not responding.
Please don't get fooled like me by seeing only the specifications on product.
Go through all the reviews posted by the customers who bought it and regret it instantly. Go for some other products. Thanks."

1914,3.0,"Buy this laptop in sale only, power button is in weird position. But every thing else is good."
1915,3.0,"Gaming - 10/10, fps in most latest well
demanding games is well above 50 range.
Thermals- 5/10, in ambient room temp of 35-40+ range the thermals are below average only while playing games like red dead redemption 2. The gpu temp touches 85+ degrees c. But if you have AC room that is not a problem. In the long run the gpu life is affected a lot by high temps. So better thermals would have been appreciated here. But whilst idle, the thermals are good enough. Roughly in the range of 50-60degrees c. Fan mode doesnot help much if your ambient temps are high. Rx 5500m is very close to rtx 3050 without dlss of nvidia. Ofcourse after dlss rtx wins easily in supported games.

Battery- 10/10, easily getting 8-10hours of backup surfing web and watching videos..and Charging is very fast.

Display - 7/10, just above average and what you expect from this range gaming laptops. 60 hertz is just okay. Not extremely enjoyeable multimedia experience.

Sound speakers- 6/10, average again, with vlc you can increase to 200% volume but it can damage the speakers in long run. Earphone sound is great.

Camera-5/10 , just average class.

Overall performance- 9/10, great performance in totality. And best to get it on sales when it goes as low as 55k range.

Overall can't go wrong with this in the 55k range."
1916,3.0,Very nice product fast processing n gaming also fast battery life is good n fast charging
1917,4.0," I bought this laptop for ₹62,000, (although the price dips at times to ₹58,990). It is one of the best laptops in this price segment considering both it's performance and functionality.
Pros:
1. It has the Radeon 5500m graphics card, which is better than the GTX 1650, that you will find in other similar, lower and even some higher priced laptops. The 5500m can easily run all recent titles at medium to high settings, 1080p 60fps. In older games like battlefield 1, GTA 5, Metro Redux, etc you can crank the settings to ultra and the fps will remain at 60fps.
2. The Ryzen 5 5600H is a beast of a processor and can handle anything that you can throw at it.
3. The 70 watt hour battery (compared to the 50 watt hour that you will find in other laptops) easily gives around 6hrs of normal use e.g. browsing, youtube, video playback, a bit of photoshop etc. while the other laptops in the price segment can hardly manage 4hrs.
4. The build quality is amazing. Its made for people, like students who need a daily driver laptop which can game and at the same time does not look too flashy. Its functional, the keyboard is good, mousepad feels good to use and the overall build quality is great.
5. Viewing angles are great, no glare or reflections as it is a matt finish screen.

Cons:
1. The fan intake vents are on either sides of the laptop. So if you are using the laptop, keeping it on your lap, the fan intakes will get blocked. You will have to keep a hard, flat base underneath in order to prevent the intakes from getting blocked.
2. The laptop is a bit heavy and if you are thinking of keeping it on your lap and using it, good luck. Your legs are going to go numb in a very short time.
3. The screen does not get very bright. So it will be difficult to use it outside, under direct sunlight.

*Note:
In many online reviews you will find complains about screen wobbling, but the issue is not as much as they are making it to be. The screen has a normal amount of wobble which you will find in most other similar sized laptops.

And if you are looking for a laptop for gaming only, don't buy this. Rather go for something with a 3050. This is good for casual gaming (it can run all games but you'll have to compromise on the graphics a bit) but not for playing all games at maxed settings and streaming at the same time.

I've run the following games on this laptop and all of them work great:
Days Gone
NFS Heat
GTA 5
Battlefield 1
Metro Redux
Dishonored 1 & 2"
1918,5.0,"I recieved the product which was manafactured and shipped in Jun/22. hence a few surprises contrary to other old reviews.
Bought it at 55k during prime day sales.
Good things about this device :
1. Windows 11 out of the box with almost everything up to date
2. MS office 2021 lifetime license
3. 512GB(477GB) Samsung(or equivalent) TLC NVme SSD(3500Mbps seq read/writes)
4. 8GB DDR4 RAM single channel 3200MHz
5. AMD Ryzen 5 5600H (upto 45W TDP)(7nm)
6. AMD Radeon RX5500M(4GB) (45-80W TGP)(7nm)
7. 4 cell 70Wh battery.
8. Great selection of ports (3x USB 3.0,1x USB typeC, 1xHDMI,1x RJ45,1x full size SD card reader, 1x audio jack)
9. Screen is definitely big at 16.1 inches
10. Feel and finish of the top lid and interior is better than many other laptops (try it out in an offline store first)

Compromises you have to make :
1. Screen is 60Hz, but an IPS one not a VA panel
2. Audio processing and tuning in windows is not natural, the moment you start listening to something, it feels artificial.
3. Heavy laptop at 2.6 KG
4. Laptop heats when pushed and might even throttle during summers, cooling solution is decent but not extra ordinary.
5. Screen wobbling only when directly under a ceiling fan.
6. Webcam is average.
7. Trackpad is decent(better buy a mouse )
8. WiFi card is decent but not the best one.

But at 55-60K this laptop justifies its price very well.

Update:
After adding an additional 16GB DDR4 RAM, the performance is on another level. Games get some extra FPS, more apps remain in memory."
1919,5.0,📷 quality not up to the mark.
1920,2.0,"This HP victus ryzen 5 5600h with Radeon RX 5500m is the deal of the decade!
It's a little beast in productivity and gaming including as follows:-
1. Preloaded with activated windows 11 home 64 bit (no worry of upgrading from windows 10) and MS office home and student 2021 for lifetime. (Activation is required at the time of opening any ms office app).
2. 70 wh battery with 150 watt fast charger is the cherry on top.
3. Beats GTX 1650 and his big brother GTX 1650 ti in upper hand.
4. Big track pad provided by HP.
5. Wobbling is there, but not noticeable doing any work as told in market.
6. 8 gb ram in single slot (1×8), upgradable upto 32 gb in dual channel memory (2×16).
7. 512 gb nvme m.2 ssd boots in 3-4 seconds in blazing speed. 1 empty slot is also provided for future upgrade, total 2 TB can be upgraded by removing 512 gb ssd already installed.
8. Have to do disk partition of 512 gb ssd by own, not a big deal.
9. 60 hz ips 1080p panel is provided with antiglare or matte finish, very low as compared to 144 hz refresh rate provided GTX 1650 and GTX 1650 ti victus model, but it's acceptable. (can add external monitor with high refresh in future).
Lastly, I would say as the owner of this particular model of HP victus, this is the complete package provided by hp in the sense of productivity and gaming, if you are getting under INR 55,000, grab it otherwise it's too late or out of stock or even in existence."
1921,2.0," I have been using this laptop for 4 day's had great experience while using it after a complete windows setup and driver's update, but for the driver's update for amd
""CPU+GPU"" driver's pls use AMD-Adrenalin software so that the graphics driver's are upto date and by this your experience will be lagg free for normal and especially for gaming and the battery life is to significantly improved .

This type of Performance is top-notch for the price to performance ratio in this laptop .

No heating issues at all while gaming ""Game name-Genshin impact"" at high settings the temperature went upto 83 degree Celsius with fan speed at Max and cooled down soon as the game is closed. The room temperature was 27-28 degree Celsius and still had great thermal efficiency nice work HP-VICTUS. The game was played on charging for 2hrs continuously.

People were talking about screen wobbling issue yes it has screen wobbling but it's not an issue actually due to bigger screen it wobbels but yes HP-VICTUS Engineer should look after it but the hinges are good, That's why if the screen wobbled with the movement of hinges then it would be a problem but the hinges are tight just the screen itself wobbles so no need to worry about this screen wobbling ✌️.

Keyboard and trackpad are good and responsive so good for it and fast boot speed ,The only thing is the camera quality it's poor it's ok not an great issue but it's competitors has good one so that's the only con of it.

So the final conclusion for this laptop is great you can go for it without any hesitation ✌️💯

And it comes with the free x-box game pass and Microsoft office lifetime validity for free ."
1922,5.0,"Best laptop for budget gaming, its beyond my expectations performance was top notch yes there are few cons like display shaking while making hard movements but its okay not a major concern to worry about go for it if u r budget is below 70k"
1923,1.0,"Absolutely Beast Laptop Got it Just 40k after exchanging my old laptop which makes it most VFM Battery Backup is awesome 6 to 7 hours on normal usage
And gaming can't say as i always game on plugged in
Only Con I found is 60HZ but it's okay for casual gaming"
1924,5.0,You can't get actual music with headphone.
1925,1.0,Wrost ever battery lif only 3 Hur battery backup in normal use. Battery automatically down when laptops complete shutdown this is horrible.
1926,2.0," Laptop CPU runs hot. Windows11/HP/AMD background software keeps cpu working at 30-40% even at idle. But right when you launch task manager to see which process is taking up so much CPU resources, these processes stop right away and you can't even figure out what processes were running. Suddenly the processor load is at 1 or 2% instead of 30-40%. Something is going on with Windows11. My issue was this background shenanigans kept the CPU/Laptop hot. Even at 30% CPU load, temperature can get near 100C. So what I do now is always keep task manager running, this keeps the unnecessary background processes stopped and lets my CPU be cool when idle. To monitor CPU load and also temperature a software called CoreTemp can be used. Essential if your CPU is being used/hijacked by some unnecessary process which hides itself in the Windows Task manager like in my case.

edit: Used a third party software called Anvir taskmanager and found windows explorer was keeping the cpu at 33% load even when idle, making the CPU temperature reach 100C for no reason. So just restarting the explorer in taskmanager fixed the issue.

Initially without any clue as to what was happening, I had to re-paste the CPU/GPU thermal paste, try out a third-party software to control AMD Ryzen temperature. More about that below. Also figured out HP factory setup for the laptop back panel had a plastic sheet which was covering up a huge air vent. So make sure to discard plastic sheet if you are planning to game and want to keep the laptop as cool as possible.

I like my laptop to stay sort of cool even when gaming, so it lasts long and I don't have to worry about replacing it's fan sooner.

I re-pasted the CPU and GPU with some Cooler Master MasterGel Pro Thermal Paste. When I opened up the thermal heat sink metal plate, there were two kinds of paste, grey on CPU/GPU and white on some other chips. The white paste is a silicon based paste called CLG-3500 the name you can find in the Maintenance and Service guide for this laptop on HP website. I left the white paste there, it's of lower thermal conductivity so basically lower quality than mastergel. I filled some gaps on it with my higher thermal conducting Mastergel paste, a few drops here and there. These chips are of lower importance in generating heat when compared to CPU/GPU and also Mastergel paste does not conduct electricity. For CPU GPU I cleaned out entire factory applied grey thermal paste with some iso alcohol/cloth and then repasted with my Mastergel paste. The mastergel/thermal paste only conducts heat to metal plate and it's upto the fans/ventilation to remove it from metal plates.

HP factory setting for this laptop blocks the main air vent on the back panel of the laptop with some kind of plastic/paper sheet thing. You can see attached pics. Don't know why HP would block a huge air vent they made themselves for their gaming laptop with a plastic sheet. This air vent sits right on top of the heat conducting metal plate and so opening this up would conduct away most of the heat from the metal plate easily, letting the laptop run cooler more easily and letting the laptop fan do less work and thus last longer. Any plans to use a laptop cooler stand with built in fans would be more effective if the back panel had lots of holes on it for cooler air to flow in. An MSi bravo laptop that I considered with same processor and graphics card as this HP victus has a backpanel that exposes most of it's metal plates to air easily with lots of holes. I initially thought this HP model also had air vents from the few pics could find earlier but only found it was blocked once I got it in my hand. So I plucked out this blocking sheet right out of the backpanel and now my airvents are fully open exposing the hot metal plate. I made a DIY laptop stand with a USB table fan and an inverted plastic box with a big hole for the fan to sit in. I put the fan inside the box and the laptop on top of the box so that the fan blows air right at the air vent/metal heat sink plate.

With this set up I am able to keep my laptop cool when gaming heavy. I ran God of War game at high graphic settings, which made my CPU consume 80-90Watts and GPU 70-80 watts and produce maximum heat, CPU went to 101 C and GPU to 90C. The frames per second for GOW game was good at 40-65fps in closed settings and slightly laggy in rare occassions. But since I repasted the CPU/GPU, my laptop backpanel air vent was fully open and I also put a table fan blowing air into the metal heat sink ... over all the laptop body was cool underside and slightly warm to touch on keyboard regardless of whether the CPU/GPU was hot. Also monitored the laptop CPU fan speed using Speedfan 4.52 software. The maximum speed is around 4800 rpm (OMEN software can force CPU fan to maximum speed). while idle it's around 2200 rpm without external fan and 0 rpm with external fan. While gaming with my current set up and an external fan, the cpu fan speed is around 3800 to 4000 rpm. It never reaches the maximum speed because over all laptop is cool even when CPU is hot.

For experts who know about TDP and want to control CPU wattage and temperature directly, there are two softwares, one is Ryzen controller and other is AMD APU Tuning Utility. Both use another program called RyzenAdj.exe which can directly change certain parameters of the Ryzen CPUs. For this Ryzen 5600H cpu, the max TDP power value it can operate at is around 113 Watts. The max temperature it can operate at is around 100C. Both are factory set and can be found using command line interface with Ryzenadj software. So using one of these softwares Ryzenadj, Ryzen controller or AMD APU Tuning Utility, you can set these values during a user session. For example you can decrease the maximum wattage allowed from 113 to 50 watts and maximum temperature can be decreased from 100C to say 70C. With these new values, the Ryzen 5600h CPU will not be able to use more power or will not be allowed to heat up beyond the set value. These settings are always reset upon restart of the laptop provided you do not apply it again. So I used these softwares to try to decrease my laptop temperature. For idle/not gaming setting, I would use a temperature limit of 70C and the CPU would never cross this value. You can also use these softwares to set temperature or TDP wattage values while gaming. For example a setting I used was not allow temperature to cross above 80C and not allow TDP to cross above 75W. Only one of these values will take precedence over the other, probably the temperature one because CPU heats up really fast even with 30% load. Played a lot using these settings and was able to get good 40-60 fps in Racing game Dirt 5 in high medium mix graphic settings on a heavy rain race track simulating most weather and graphic effects. The CPU temperature never crossed 80-81C. GPu temperature reached near 80C but this cannot be controlled directly by these softwares, only can change and control CPU values. If lacking a Laptop cooling stand and external fan, I would use these softwares to decrease laptop temperature but otherwise it's not necessary.

Laptop monitor lacks color, Recommend installing latest AMD radeon drivers and AMD Adrenalin software. I increased the saturation of my monitor. AMD Adrenalin software also has a vivid setting for global display/graphics. Use that to show more colorful display and in game .

The Laptop graphics card has 4GB vram which can affect high texture graphics required for some games. Some games like dirt 5 or forza 5 gives vram low warnings. Still for Dirt 5 graphics is pretty great. For Forza 5 it could use a bit improvement. Forza 4 runs great and has great graphics though. Though at this price point this laptop is good , most 6GB vram laptops are selling at way higher prices. I would recommend a high 6GB VRAM graphic card rather than a Nvidia 3050 as an improvement over this rx 5500m

Also recommend getting another 8GB RAM as it would add more to gaming and multi tasking experience. I installed two 16 Gb rams to have total 32GB and everything works great, switches programs on the fly, from gaming to work instantly. Some rare games like God of war and Modern warfare warzone battle royale used more than 16 GB ram, up to 20GB. For most other games 16GB should be more than enough.

edit: tried out several games, all action adventure and racing games available for xbox gaming pass and EA play subscription . Over all the impression is this laptop is good for gaming at 1920 x 1080 resolution with greater than 40 fps minimum at high graphic settings. It can go to ultra graphics for games released before 2020. One issue I found was when gaming long hours, the battery seems to be discharging at a slow but significant rate even when power cable was connected. The issue could be either laptop or my home's power lines. No idea.

edit2:
Due to modifying my laptop cpu's power settings using third party sw, or due to unlocking and using windows ultimate performance/high performance power plans in windows power options, one of those two reasons, Maybe not these reasons at all, but anyway my cpu and gpu together are consuming more than 150 watts that the power brick can provide and this is what is causing the battery drainage when I play games for over 5 to 6 hours continuously. So I now limit the cpu power limit to around 78W using ryzen controller sw. Rest of the power from power brick is reserved for graphics card. This resolves the battery draining problem I was having and I am still able to play games at more or less same quality, speed and graphics. Constant draining and recharging would be bad for battery life. This makes it seem like the cpu and gpu of this laptop could have performed greater if it were provided a 200W power brick."
1927,5.0,"Works really well if you debloat your Windows 11. Only problem I encounter is that WiFi disconnects sometime and I have to uninstall the device from Device manager and then refresh again. Haven't enountered this problem on Fedora Linux yet, so it seems to be a Win11 issue.

Screen Wobble is manageable, you night have to change the screen angle as fan can make it wobble.

Keyboard is not good, but I guess that's the problem with every laptop membrane keyboard.

Windows 11 secure boot compulsion is annoying for anyone looking to distro hop.

Linux support is good."
1928,5.0,"Starting with the Bad thing
1) Screen Shake, while it is under average or high-speed fan it will strongly hit when you are a 1st-time laptop owner
2) Keyboard backlight brightness adjustment not there
3) NO CAMERA SHUTTER

NOW GOOD PART
1) BIG SCREEN
2) DYNAMIC LOOK ESPECIALLY IN BLACK COLOUR
3) Windows 11
4) Battery Life is good for gaming guys but for the casual user battery life is more awesome
5) Almost all needy ports are there
6) dual fan with proper function adjustment which helps to reduce the temperature
7) So many +points are there about this product"
1929,1.0,"Packaging was PATHETIC just pathetic .
Just the amazon cover over the hp box , no cushioning, just one hit and my laptop would have gone .

Now about the product ,
It is my initial review after using 2 days .
I am gonna tell about the cons here.
First thing first ,it is damn heavy .
IT DISCONNECTED WIFI TWICE ,I had to restart my pc (very bad wifi stick used).
It has minor backlit bleed at the top corner (ingnorable)
BATTERY: honestly speaking I expected more battery back that is the reason I had gone with victus not pavallion .disappointed here.
Will test more .

UPDATE : Attached some pictures of backlight bleeding 1st at 100 percent brightness and second at 50 percent brightness . It really feels cheap now .one star removed from review . Stay tuned ."
1930,2.0,"Bought this in December 2021, when I was on a lookout for a new laptop to edit videos on. I chose a gaming laptop since the hardware suitable for such task is only available on gaming machines in this category and budget. I had done my research which told me that video rendering is mostly a CPU-heavy task and there was very little difference between NVIDIA and AMD GPUs. It was my mistake to believe it. Premiere Pro doesn't officially support AMD Radeon 5500M, though its latest version does support hardware encoding with AMD GPU, but I still feel a lack of performance. If you want to further your interests with After Effects and Blender, then it is totally not an ideal GPU currently. Better to go with similarly specced NVIDIA model.

Other big pet peeve is that the Realtek WiFi card stops working once in a while, needing to restart the computer or disable and reenable the card from Windows Device Manager. Very frustrating, especially if you're in middle of a call or a transaction. I don't know if it's a driver or hardware issue. I waited for a software update all this time, but will go to the service center and get the card replaced now. Even the GPU drivers from HP are mismatch and Radeon Software was not behaving properly with the stock drivers.

Despite the configuration, the weight is a bit too much, makes it a pain to carry around. And the 16 inch screen size didn't feel like a big increment from 15.6 perhaps because of the aspect ratio.

No complaints on gaming front, everything runs smoothly, the GPU gets to do its work pretty well there. The battery drains quickly under medium to heavy loads though."
1931,5.0,"I m writing this review after 1 month. Well, the laptop is good but battery backup is of 6 hrs it is consuming 15 percent in an hour."
1932,5.0,"Good HP Laptop with this price Range. It is working good as per its configuration. Feel more weight compare to my Lenovo. But keypad and other functions are excellent. The only issue frequently I am facing is, Wi-Fi disconnection. There is frequent wi-fi disconnections are there. Finally I changed few settings and then now its working fine. Overall it is good and powerful laptop from HP."
1933,1.0,"Review after 2 day
Laptop is just owsome and battery life is also very good 6.5 to 7+ hours of battery backup when battery saver is on all the time . Firstly i got only 5 hours backup without battery backup which is bad. But now i am fully satisfied with this laptop and its battery. If you are concerned with battery then then this is the best battery gaming powerful laptop under 60000. Btw got it 48000"
1934,2.0,"I was initially happy to get this. I did upgrade the RAM to 16 GB because 8 GB was too slow for me.
Even after upgrade of RAM, I feel the laptop lags at times and I think it is because of Windows 11 which is crap in my opinion. Overall an okish laptop for the price.

Pros are Windows 11 licensed edition along with Microsoft Office lifetime license. Processor is decent enough. Price was decent got at 50k package. Gets windows update frequently.
Cons are Battery life is so bad at times gives 1.30 hrs for processor-intensive tasks and 4 hours plus for normal web browsing. Wifi keeps getting disconnected at times, not sure if this is an issue with Windows 11 or the hardware but disabling driver and enabling fixes the issue, so looks like a driver issue somehow.
Screen wobbles if you are carrying that is not a big issue as long as you are not running with it the screen open."
1935,5.0,Apart from camera side and also 60hz refresh rate this peice is master blaster

1937,1.0,"The good: -
(1) looks good and has a good ventilation.
(2) performance is very snappy.
(3) good battery life for very basic use like Microsoft excel. It lasts 6-7 hrs on it.
(4) charges fast.
(5) keyboard algorithm is very good and the toughpad is big and very useful.

The bad and the ugly:
(1) 100% of battery will only last 20-30mins max on gaming. And so you have to keep it plugged.
(2) power on the laptop and launch the game immediately and the game will lag/stutter for 10mins. Idk why... Even i upgraded the ram to 16gb.
(3) built quality is descent but the plastic edges may hurt yo sometimes.
(4) screen wobble may annoy you.
(5) screen bleed is ugly.
(6) sound quality is good but B&O but the volume is very low.. Bottom firing speakers with pure treble. Not even a trace of beats in the sound signature... Not idk for what reason the audio output from aux is very poor.. Mono like sound... With no bass!.
(7) will not be a good choice for Gaming as the performance fluctuates while gaming."
1938,2.0,"I got one with dead pixels so I requested for replacement. They arranged inspection twice but no one came for inspection and they marked as inspection completed. I contacted with amazon customer care, they registered compliant against them and processed my replacement. After a painfull process they finally replaced it. They were very polite.
Screen wobbling vary from laptop to laptop. The previous one i got had tight hinges and didn't wobble at all. But the one I have now have wobbling issue If i sit under fan.
It wobble only under fan or cooler.
I use it in power saving mode with 0 brightness with 7-8 tabs open in browser, vs code, android studio.
It gives me 6 to 8 hours battery backup. And when i only watch videos it gives me 9 hours backup.
I haven't tried gaming on it so cant say about that.
If you want good battery backup then always use it in battery saver mode."
1939,5.0,If you're not a beginner gamer then go for it. It is a beast😈😈
1940,4.0,"Laptop is ok
But i had some problems with warranty
The delivery agent is very very careless
Product came in broken outside cover
But Laptop cover is ok
Delivery agent was very rude."
1941,4.0,"Features are great but a lot heavy to carry anywhere or put it on your lap , heating issue is there , these two significant cons otherwise a great laptop."
1942,4.0,Not for high end gaming or gaming for long durations.
1943,3.0,"Overall a good product. Go for it without any doubts! Performance is best, no major issues encountered.
Their is some glitch in wifi connectivity but restarting once will get it on the line and works perfectly for weeks together without this issue.
Pros- 1. Best for Engineers especially designers and mechanical domain which have heavy softwares.
2. Free windows 11 and MS office makes it a great deal.
3. 12cores are great for quick tasks.
4. Graphic card is decent. All rendering tasks are quick and without screenlag

Cons-
Add-on RAM or SSD is required as the basic one will be short for heavy softwares.

Go for it if the pricing is less than 61K"
1944,3.0,"This laptop never disappointed me in any aspect leaving its 2.25 kg weight. Its look, performance, display, charging and speakers good for me as this is my first lap. It is overall a year completed. Still victus lap is working awesome in all aspects. It is a laptop for those who need a laptop with a gaming features but with student lap looks 🙂. I love this laptop simply"
1945,4.0,Nice product.
1946,4.0,"Since it's an entry-level gaming laptop, that said it's understandable that it's bulky and the screen refresh rate is 60hz which you are going to see in lots of reviews. Btw I am posting this review after using this laptop for 3 months now.

So first let's talk about some of the graphic intensive games and their fps: - in all games, I have locked fps to 60hz so it might be higher for some games.

1. The Witcher 3 (ultra) : 60fps
2. Destiny2 (high): 60fps
3. The Division 2 (ultra) : 51-59 fps
4. The Crew 2 (high) : 45 fps avg.
5. RDR 2 (high - this is the highest setting i can apply because of limited vRAM) : 40 - 45 fps

the only thing which I don't like is that the bottom heat sink is not quite raised, so if I don't raise the laptop a little bit from the back the temp touched 100 degrees even though the fans are running at max speed.

I also faced an issue installing the AMD software: adrenalin edition which its equivalent to Geforce experience, so I cannot do the fine-tuning or optimizing to some of the games which are built for AMD graphics.

All other features are absolute above par compared to the price -
1. Battery ( i think this would be the usp for this laptop),
2. Speakers are great depending on what you are listening (it's loud for the music but for gaming and streaming movies it's not that great ).
3. Not RGB backlit keyboard - which I really want no RGB BS.
4. You can expect 6 core cpu (3.10 ghz boost) in this price segment in the gaming laptop - all thanks to AMD
5. Radeon Rx 5500M which beats the gtx 1650 and 1650ti at the lower price.

All in all, there are few cons that come with this laptop which are not worth mentioning because this is a budget laptop, and to reduce the cost they have to definitely compromise in some ways. So as compared to other gaming laptops in this price segment this would definitely beat the others.

For me, this laptop is meeting my day-to-day requirements as of now."
1947,4.0,This laptop disconnects wifi connection without intimation. Screen beelding issue. The major problem that i have faced in this laptop
1948,4.0,Delivered on time very good packaging by amazon product looks and feels sturdy will post a complete review after using it for about a month
1949,4.0, Satisfied with the product battery life is good 5to6 hours and multitasking 3t04 hours display quality is very good pure ips not thats cheap ips level panel that's why I bought this laptop there's a lot of gaming laptop comes with ips level panels that's it
1950,4.0,"The seller sent HP Victus Ryzen 7 with gtx1650 instead of Ryzen 5 with Rx5500m, i had to get a replacement for the right model, amazon delivered both the original order and replacement order withing two days and both laptops were of good quality, whole review and replacement process took about 10 days. comparing the two i would say Ryzen 5 model is equally good in multitasking and everyday usage and twice as good in gaming! this made me appreciate this laptop even more.

battery life is good enough.
restarts in about 10 seconds!
keyboard is nice to type on.
1080p 60hz screen is really good for watching multimedia and webpage text are CRISP!
webcam is good enough, has wide angle.
build quality is good, all plastic but seems to be durable, hopefully the hinges will stay good.
windows 11 OS.
trackpad is reasonably good. click buttons could have been better but that is how most laptops are these days, its about average.

my laptop has backlight bleeding issue, only during black screen bootup or restart i can see yellowish light bleed, but once it finishes booting up i don't see it anymore and even on black background i dont see it, i guess its acceptable and not and issue in my case

a 90hr screen for this gaming laptop would have been good to have and the gpu is capable of pushing 90fps on medium graphics that would have made this laptop flawless! probably overclocking the scrren to 75hr might help or buying a high refresh rate monitor would be better. other than that zero complaints and this is the best laptop you can ever buy for 55k in 2022. i got this for 42k after exchanging old laptop.

overall very happy with the laptop, does everything i need.
good for gaming, so far played battlefield v, never went below 60fps on highest ultra settings (game was locked at 60fps max) if i have to guess the max fps would be around 80fps for this game when plugged in. Rx5500m is a really good GPU! :)"
1951,5.0,"using it since a month, this is an amazing machine. Got it in 48000.
i am using it in all possible ways. sometimes play games in it, never lagged a bit.
i am using it professionally also great typing experience .
for the maximum time i open two browsers and minimum 4-5 tabs in each browser never got any problem.
if this laptop falls under your budget definitely go for it.
i cant compare it with other laptops as in this budget i wasnt getting any other laptop with simmilar specs."
1952,3.0,"I received 2 days ago.... fabulous product.

Pros.- • Internally very strong

• Loud and clear speakers
• Display colour optimization
• Professional looks

Cons.-• Camera is 👎👎(but considering gaming
laptop... ok)
• There is no battery charging
limiter upto 80%.(It has only some regular battery health care feature)

**Display sharpness is average (Same 1920×1080 is used in large 16.1 inch display).
70 Whr battery life is good (7-8 hrs in normal use).This dude is heavy....
But everything is justified looking at the performance.Who else gives this much in this price (I bought at 51k ... including bank discount)....Super purchase😇😇
Just go for it...."

Everything is good in this laptop, except camera and cpu temperature reaches 90℃ while playing games. If you want to play games use cooling pad.
Bhai koi bhi agar laptop le rhe ho to screen bleeding test aur dead pixel test jaroor krna.
Agar sirf gaming ke liye hi lena hai to is range me jo dusre laptops hain unka gaming test jaroor compare krna."
1956,5.0,"Update after 1 week:

Battery is good for professional use: MS Word, 5-8 PDFs, Edge browser, WhatsApp app.

Display is slightly yellow in tone. Didn't test outside.

Speakers are good for internals and it will work.

There is some hanging issue when I click on battery icon or when I go in a folder and right click. Then the mouse hangs for 1 - 2 seconds.

There is ZERO heating issues for a professional use. I can even use on my lap for some time.

Screen wobble is ZERO in my case. I believe I received a good unit. Haha. It is normal wobble that you will even see in MacBook also.

Screen opens with single hand is a beautiful feature.

Will update review after 1 month now.

Dislikes:
Screen wobbles too much even from the fan air.
Not satisfied with the performance.
Battery draining so fast.
Cpu and Gpu getting so much heat even when normal usage.
Takes too much time to load all the applications on windows screen once powered ON.

1961,3.0,"Buy this laptop in sale only, power button is in weird position. But every thing else is good."
1962,5.0,"Gaming - 10/10, fps in most latest well
demanding games is well above 50 range.
Thermals- 5/10, in ambient room temp of 35-40+ range the thermals are below average only while playing games like red dead redemption 2. The gpu temp touches 85+ degrees c. But if you have AC room that is not a problem. In the long run the gpu life is affected a lot by high temps. So better thermals would have been appreciated here. But whilst idle, the thermals are good enough. Roughly in the range of 50-60degrees c. Fan mode doesnot help much if your ambient temps are high. Rx 5500m is very close to rtx 3050 without dlss of nvidia. Ofcourse after dlss rtx wins easily in supported games.

Battery- 10/10, easily getting 8-10hours of backup surfing web and watching videos..and Charging is very fast.

Display - 7/10, just above average and what you expect from this range gaming laptops. 60 hertz is just okay. Not extremely enjoyeable multimedia experience.

Sound speakers- 6/10, average again, with vlc you can increase to 200% volume but it can damage the speakers in long run. Earphone sound is great.

Camera-5/10 , just average class.

Overall performance- 9/10, great performance in totality. And best to get it on sales when it goes as low as 55k range.

Overall can't go wrong with this in the 55k range."
1963,5.0,Very nice product fast processing n gaming also fast battery life is good n fast charging
1964,5.0," I bought this laptop for ₹62,000, (although the price dips at times to ₹58,990). It is one of the best laptops in this price segment considering both it's performance and functionality.
Pros:
1. It has the Radeon 5500m graphics card, which is better than the GTX 1650, that you will find in other similar, lower and even some higher priced laptops. The 5500m can easily run all recent titles at medium to high settings, 1080p 60fps. In older games like battlefield 1, GTA 5, Metro Redux, etc you can crank the settings to ultra and the fps will remain at 60fps.
2. The Ryzen 5 5600H is a beast of a processor and can handle anything that you can throw at it.
3. The 70 watt hour battery (compared to the 50 watt hour that you will find in other laptops) easily gives around 6hrs of normal use e.g. browsing, youtube, video playback, a bit of photoshop etc. while the other laptops in the price segment can hardly manage 4hrs.
4. The build quality is amazing. Its made for people, like students who need a daily driver laptop which can game and at the same time does not look too flashy. Its functional, the keyboard is good, mousepad feels good to use and the overall build quality is great.
5. Viewing angles are great, no glare or reflections as it is a matt finish screen.

Cons:
1. The fan intake vents are on either sides of the laptop. So if you are using the laptop, keeping it on your lap, the fan intakes will get blocked. You will have to keep a hard, flat base underneath in order to prevent the intakes from getting blocked.
2. The laptop is a bit heavy and if you are thinking of keeping it on your lap and using it, good luck. Your legs are going to go numb in a very short time.
3. The screen does not get very bright. So it will be difficult to use it outside, under direct sunlight.

*Note:
In many online reviews you will find complains about screen wobbling, but the issue is not as much as they are making it to be. The screen has a normal amount of wobble which you will find in most other similar sized laptops.

And if you are looking for a laptop for gaming only, don't buy this. Rather go for something with a 3050. This is good for casual gaming (it can run all games but you'll have to compromise on the graphics a bit) but not for playing all games at maxed settings and streaming at the same time.

I've run the following games on this laptop and all of them work great:
Days Gone
NFS Heat
GTA 5
Battlefield 1
Metro Redux
Dishonored 1 & 2"
1965,5.0,"I recieved the product which was manafactured and shipped in Jun/22. hence a few surprises contrary to other old reviews.
Bought it at 55k during prime day sales.
Good things about this device :
1. Windows 11 out of the box with almost everything up to date
2. MS office 2021 lifetime license
3. 512GB(477GB) Samsung(or equivalent) TLC NVme SSD(3500Mbps seq read/writes)
4. 8GB DDR4 RAM single channel 3200MHz
5. AMD Ryzen 5 5600H (upto 45W TDP)(7nm)
6. AMD Radeon RX5500M(4GB) (45-80W TGP)(7nm)
7. 4 cell 70Wh battery.
8. Great selection of ports (3x USB 3.0,1x USB typeC, 1xHDMI,1x RJ45,1x full size SD card reader, 1x audio jack)
9. Screen is definitely big at 16.1 inches
10. Feel and finish of the top lid and interior is better than many other laptops (try it out in an offline store first)

Compromises you have to make :
1. Screen is 60Hz, but an IPS one not a VA panel
2. Audio processing and tuning in windows is not natural, the moment you start listening to something, it feels artificial.
3. Heavy laptop at 2.6 KG
4. Laptop heats when pushed and might even throttle during summers, cooling solution is decent but not extra ordinary.
5. Screen wobbling only when directly under a ceiling fan.
6. Webcam is average.
7. Trackpad is decent(better buy a mouse )
8. WiFi card is decent but not the best one.

But at 55-60K this laptop justifies its price very well.

Update:
After adding an additional 16GB DDR4 RAM, the performance is on another level. Games get some extra FPS, more apps remain in memory."
1966,5.0,📷 quality not up to the mark.
1967,5.0,"This HP victus ryzen 5 5600h with Radeon RX 5500m is the deal of the decade!
It's a little beast in productivity and gaming including as follows:-
1. Preloaded with activated windows 11 home 64 bit (no worry of upgrading from windows 10) and MS office home and student 2021 for lifetime. (Activation is required at the time of opening any ms office app).
2. 70 wh battery with 150 watt fast charger is the cherry on top.
3. Beats GTX 1650 and his big brother GTX 1650 ti in upper hand.
4. Big track pad provided by HP.
5. Wobbling is there, but not noticeable doing any work as told in market.
6. 8 gb ram in single slot (1×8), upgradable upto 32 gb in dual channel memory (2×16).
7. 512 gb nvme m.2 ssd boots in 3-4 seconds in blazing speed. 1 empty slot is also provided for future upgrade, total 2 TB can be upgraded by removing 512 gb ssd already installed.
8. Have to do disk partition of 512 gb ssd by own, not a big deal.
9. 60 hz ips 1080p panel is provided with antiglare or matte finish, very low as compared to 144 hz refresh rate provided GTX 1650 and GTX 1650 ti victus model, but it's acceptable. (can add external monitor with high refresh in future).
Lastly, I would say as the owner of this particular model of HP victus, this is the complete package provided by hp in the sense of productivity and gaming, if you are getting under INR 55,000, grab it otherwise it's too late or out of stock or even in existence."
1968,3.0," I have been using this laptop for 4 day's had great experience while using it after a complete windows setup and driver's update, but for the driver's update for amd
""CPU+GPU"" driver's pls use AMD-Adrenalin software so that the graphics driver's are upto date and by this your experience will be lagg free for normal and especially for gaming and the battery life is to significantly improved .

This type of Performance is top-notch for the price to performance ratio in this laptop .

No heating issues at all while gaming ""Game name-Genshin impact"" at high settings the temperature went upto 83 degree Celsius with fan speed at Max and cooled down soon as the game is closed. The room temperature was 27-28 degree Celsius and still had great thermal efficiency nice work HP-VICTUS. The game was played on charging for 2hrs continuously.

People were talking about screen wobbling issue yes it has screen wobbling but it's not an issue actually due to bigger screen it wobbels but yes HP-VICTUS Engineer should look after it but the hinges are good, That's why if the screen wobbled with the movement of hinges then it would be a problem but the hinges are tight just the screen itself wobbles so no need to worry about this screen wobbling ✌️.

Keyboard and trackpad are good and responsive so good for it and fast boot speed ,The only thing is the camera quality it's poor it's ok not an great issue but it's competitors has good one so that's the only con of it.

So the final conclusion for this laptop is great you can go for it without any hesitation ✌️💯

And it comes with the free x-box game pass and Microsoft office lifetime validity for free ."

- Alexa built in, live updates
- HD display with backlit keyboard
- Battery upto 4-5 hours with minimal brightness, normal use
Cons:
- Only 1 slot for RAM upto 16gb
- Display could have been better, may strain eyes in prolonged use
- Not fully antiglare, can see reflection if light is very bright in backend
Overall good buy if u compromise in display, side angle views and light gaming"
2119,5.0,"The laptop is good, audio is better and camera quality is little bit poor.. but good for this price range. One of the best laptop for i5 11 gen in this price range. Back lit is awesome. Best for students who want to learn."
2120,5.0,Charger and laptop heating problem
2121,5.0,"1. though I am a prime customer, delivery was delayed 4 days than promised.
2. No Technician visit will happen, during the return period. so better to return or go for a refund if any issues during that period.
3. Game Pass - forget about it. no one knows anything about it.

coming to laptop:
performance is good. The battery back is little poor only I can say. if you do not put it on the stand it will get heated up. you need to put it on a stand while using it.
I see charged adapter is also very hot than usual. not sure why."
2122,5.0,Comfortable to use
2123,3.0,"Great choice, i totally loved it.
Worth for money."
2124,5.0,Batter backup isn't that great however other features are fine
2125,5.0,"its good one thing is its full of plastic body if you want to go for metal then same laptop available in ideapad slim 5 10k more than this product price, and who wants Separate (dedicated) graphics card then its not a choice, but overall performance is good and fast
you can run at a time 10 to 20 applications"
2126,5.0,"I am fully satisfied with my purchase. The Lenovo laptop was a necessary upgrade from my 9 years old Sony VAIO. The design is super awesome and the performance is lightning fast. Everything from its display to processor speed, I have really found no area for complain so far. Also, this laptop runs on Windows 11, the latest OS from Microsoft flawlessly.
There were so many options available but I choose to go for Lenovo and I really am proud of my decision. To sum up, all I can say is this laptop has given me the best experience so far.
Thank you to Amazon for providing exceptional service which is something we have got used to by now."
2127,5.0,Unsatisfied with the laptop.Viewing angles are very poor.Keyboard experience is worst.Gets slow down when charged
2128,5.0,"I wanted a fast laptop for my personal use. This laptop fulfilled all my needs, This is great buy at this price. i5 12th gen CPU and 16 GB memory along with SSD drive makes this laptop work faster.

Only negative point is battery. It could have been better. Backup is just 2-2.5 hours even for new device.

But overall at 57k this was a good deal."
2129,2.0,Quality of the product is not good. Track pad Quality also not good . Battery decent . If you want to buy a good quality product go for ideapad slim 5 that had way better quality than this.
2130,5.0,"Performance wise really great laptop but if you are going for a TN display then it becomes really painful to look at the laptop. If you are planning to spend a good number of hours with a laptop working on it then I believe it will impact the eyesight because the colours look washed out in TN display even if you try setting up various display brightness levels it won't look good. You need to sit and look from an exact angle to get the property visibility. Don't expect any good results if you are looking at the screen from angle more than 30 degree. From the left, it will look too bright white and from the right, you will see too dark black. Lenovo has given both TN and IPS displays - TN display is for low-budget laptops and IPS for a higher budget. Lenovo has clearly mentioned it is TN display so it is general characteristics of the TN display to work like that and it does not provide good viewing angles in general.

Also, speaker's sound is not that great.

Performance wise this is a great laptop - no fan sound very silent operation and all the applications program runs smoothly without any issues.

TN Screen displays 2 out of 5. (go for IPS version)
Speaker sounds 2 out of 5.

In nutshell, it is a low budget laptop with a main focus on performance with an average display and speaker but with great processor power and RAM."
2131,5.0,It is bundled with OS and MSoffice great value for the money invested.
2132,1.0,"Its very good product. Value for money.

2133,1.0,"Only best part of the laptop is Intel 12th gen , hybrid processor. This ultra responsive, fast and smooth in executing the applications. Better display could have chosen for the price range."
2134,5.0,Not good
2135,1.0,"Writing this review after using it for a day. Got it for an affordable price upon exchange of my old laptop. I could say it's the best deal once can have. Laptop looks premium with wide screen of 15.7"" but battery life is about 3-4 hrs max depending upon the usage. Boot time is very quick within 30s i could say and performance wise really good with Intel i5 and 12th generation processor. Please note that it is not a gaming laptop but i feel it supports gaming applications too from its config wise.
Overall a good and an affordable product for normal Office/college or personal usage."
2136,4.0,Good quality.... Processor is very fast and screen quality class.... For Dolby sound u need to connect speakers it's amazing.... overall wow.....

2155,5.0,"Don't buy any Lenovo product. My display is not working within 10 days of purchase. Trust me, there is no one out there to help you. I am going from here and there to get it replaced but they are only offering repair. So, you have to satisfy yourself with a repaired defective product instead of a new one. Still if you want to buy, don't go with Amazon..they offer less window for return and don't help you any further even if you are a loyal Prime member also. So, my experience is that stay away from Lenovo and Amazon. I will also give up my Prime membership next month."

2157,4.0,"Received a faulty system. When reached out to the manufacturer, they kept giving different reasons. From wrong purchase date to no technician available, they kept delaying the service.

no hard cover just flexible plastic case. Overall good"
2204,5.0,"The crucial's ram is good ,no any issues. But the packing is not satisfying. It came in a long amazon plastic cover , in which having ram within that transparent thing .no any boxes..etc...

I have already brought an ssd ,which is very packed and very satisfactory. Both of them i brought in great indian sale and you all know how a product is handled during shipment on the period of sales."
2205,5.0,Use full item it's working good
2206,5.0,"Price wise is good to upgrade your laptops
I have a hp pavillion gaming laptop with a samsung 8gb ram installed. Added this and now it is 16gb of total ram. Most AAA games use more ram nowadays so is a good option to upgrade."
2207,4.0,"I got the right version of the RAM with 32000MHz, as I brought it for a newly bought laptop Asus TUF A17 2021, I couldn't install it on my own, cause it will void the warranty of the laptop(I got this information from Asus customer support). So I took it to Asus service centre to install it, now it's working perfectly."
2208,5.0,It is a perfect upgrade for Dell G15 5511. RAM is compatible and running smoothly however at the time of delivery the packaging of the RAM could have been done in a better way atleast in a box not in a platic bag as it is a fragile product and could have been damaged in transit.
2209,5.0,"Not sure what others are talking about, but this is not a single rank RAM and it is a dual rank RAM which honestly barely would make a difference in everyday use. It's not especially fast, so maybe next time I'll go for a different brand next time but using it everyday for the last six months or so, and it's good enough."
2210,5.0,"Compatible with hp pavilion gaming i5 10gen gtx 1650ti . nice product , single rank memeory ."
2211,5.0,"Very good product.
I installed it by myself onto my ASUS TUF A17 Laptop.
Working Flawlessly.
Ran Red Dead Redemption 2 on the highest settings. It's Super smooth."
2212,5.0,"Easy to install, working properly, value for money 🤑"
2213,5.0,So the RAM which I got is a single rank RAM x16 not the x8 which is gives slightly more performance. Otherwise RAM is good and it's a original crucial one. Seller need to specify which type they are sending so that we can decide before purchase.
2214,5.0,"Very good Ram
Original ram"
2215,5.0,Bought this RAM for my HP victus laptop R5 5600H( GPU:RTX3050). Working like a Charm. Rrcognised by the os. (Windows11)
2216,5.0,"Purchase Price - 1950₹
CL 22 - 3200Mhz - Single Rank Memory Kit

I'm fine by it being single Rank don't have time to invest in getting that additional 5-10% by searching for Dual Rank Stick
Had a reasonable boost 10-15% in My laptop going from 1x8 to 2x8 Ram Config
Mostly it's more Smoother than Higher Performance"
2217,4.0,"I received the dual rank 16GB memory stick, just what I wanted!"
2218,5.0,"I ordered 2 sticks of dual-rank Ram from different sellers as it got out of stock for one seller. But I received one dual-rank and another single-rank (as you can see in the images above). Which did make me a little upset but soon after contacting Amazon and the seller my issue got resolved and I got a full refund for it so now I'm happy again.

Now, coming to the products I'm happy with the products as after installing the rams my beast (Predator Helios 300 PH315-53) became more responsive and usable for work.

For those who might be wondering why someone may need 32 GB of Ram then I did say there are several reasons and cases you may need it. Specifically, if you are a coder who works on large projects and has to run several emulations simultaneously which was the case for me, increasing the ram helped me a lot by speeding up my work. Some things are impossible to work on 16GB no matter how much you try.

So, go with 32 GB if you think you may need it. The price difference is not much in comparison to the time you may waste due to a slow system with frequent crashes when working."
2219,5.0,Now my laptop become faster then before
2220,5.0,Will update if anything happens
2221,4.0,Absolutely great. Very very good performance. 3200mhz with my ryzen 5 4600h is showing its power.
2222,5.0,Best ram for gaming
2223,5.0,"Previous I had a 8GB DDR4 3200MT/s, 1Rx8 and was planning to upgrade my system from many months
This RAM is 16GB with 1Rx8 configuration. (Rest all the values like CAS, latency etc are same) means both RAM are single channel individually and running at flex mode(better than single channel and close to dual channel) right now.

Currently my PC is operating in 24GB RAM. I ran windows memory diagnosis, UEFI memory check and found no issues.

To know your RAM details
Download Thaiphoon Burner
then click on Read > Report - you will get every detail here.

Copy ""DRAM Component"" column data and search it on google, to get the datasheet.

Pls verify all data on Thaiphoon Burner with physical dies of RAM (by taking photo of it before installing on laptop)"
2224,5.0,"Product is good and working perfectly.
My current existing ram is sk hynix CL22 single rank x16 and adding crucial ram with this matching perfectly with existing timings and cas latency.

With 16GB ram bandwidth doubles and performance also increased. Only cons is it's slower ram (single rank x16) compare to dual rank x8. Crucial should mention whether it's single rank or dual rank with x8 or x16 in Amazon or their own official site because it just confuse end users and ended up getting slower ram."
2225,5.0,"Working fine with my acer nitro 5 4600h which has 8gb of 3200mhz ram installed and i have installed this crucial 8gb ram and its working fine it shows 2X64 bit chennal (Dual chennal) in cpuz

earlier it was working only single chennal with only 8 gb ram

now its showing 16gb (15.4 gb due to ryzen 5 4600h cos its uses 500mb ram for its i gpu)"
2226,4.0,Go for it

2238,4.0,Good
2239,4.0,It's working perfectly till now
2240,4.0,"Got this for 1900 and been using it for 3 weeks. It works perfectly fine with the laptop and there is certainly increased performance in gaming (tried in horizon zero dawn) ,if you are looking for ram to dual channel your laptop and have tight budget it is a good buy"
2241,4.0,Good
2242,5.0,"I am using this ram since last two month for dell inspiron 5415 - ryzen 5500u with 8 gb , easily installed and working like charms , so any dell user with above configuration wants to try this will be fine"

2246,5.0,Performance is really good!
2247,5.0,"Easy to install, basic ram , awesome speed
Not gaming use"
2248,5.0,I was waiting years to play spiderman pc on my acer Nitro 5 finally it got released but when I play i didn't get to experience the 60fps it got even stuck on the shutter on medium settings after I upgraded it. I can clearly get more than 60fps on high settings and it even supported very high without shutter. I'm truly suprised how powerful this RAM is. You should go for it. Worth the money
2249,5.0,"The ram is 8GB DDR4 CL-22 3200mhz.
It's single rank 1rx8.
I can't see a dual rank option for 8 GB.
Since a laptop has only two slots your priority should be to use both slots for dual channel.
Unless you have hardcore editing work 8gb in both slots will work very nicely. The difference between 16 gb and 32 gb in dual channel isn't really much for gaming. The latter works best for heavy users.
The seller was Appario retail and the RAM is genuine. I think they should mention the ram rank specifically. I was expecting 2rx8 but it's 1rx8."
2250,5.0,HAPPY WITH THE RAM PERFORMANCE. MY ASUS TUF LAPTOP RUNNING SUPERFAS
2251,5.0,यह वास्तव में एक अच्छी रैम है और मुझे सभी गेमर्स को इसकी सिफारिश करनी चाहिए
2252,5.0,
2253,5.0,Secondary ram timings could have been lower
2254,5.0,"Plus side is prompt delivery, received what was shown on the site,can't say about performance just two days since installation, down side is packaging,
no hard cover just flexible plastic case. Overall good"
2255,5.0,"The crucial's ram is good ,no any issues. But the packing is not satisfying. It came in a long amazon plastic cover , in which having ram within that transparent thing .no any boxes..etc...

I have already brought an ssd ,which is very packed and very satisfactory. Both of them i brought in great indian sale and you all know how a product is handled during shipment on the period of sales."
2256,5.0,Use full item it's working good
2257,4.0,"Price wise is good to upgrade your laptops
I have a hp pavillion gaming laptop with a samsung 8gb ram installed. Added this and now it is 16gb of total ram. Most AAA games use more ram nowadays so is a good option to upgrade."
2258,5.0,"I got the right version of the RAM with 32000MHz, as I brought it for a newly bought laptop Asus TUF A17 2021, I couldn't install it on my own, cause it will void the warranty of the laptop(I got this information from Asus customer support). So I took it to Asus service centre to install it, now it's working perfectly."
2259,5.0,It is a perfect upgrade for Dell G15 5511. RAM is compatible and running smoothly however at the time of delivery the packaging of the RAM could have been done in a better way atleast in a box not in a platic bag as it is a fragile product and could have been damaged in transit.
2260,3.0,"Not sure what others are talking about, but this is not a single rank RAM and it is a dual rank RAM which honestly barely would make a difference in everyday use. It's not especially fast, so maybe next time I'll go for a different brand next time but using it everyday for the last six months or so, and it's good enough."
2261,5.0,"Compatible with hp pavilion gaming i5 10gen gtx 1650ti . nice product , single rank memeory ."
2262,4.0,"Very good product.
I installed it by myself onto my ASUS TUF A17 Laptop.
Working Flawlessly.
Ran Red Dead Redemption 2 on the highest settings. It's Super smooth."
2263,5.0,"Easy to install, working properly, value for money 🤑"
2264,5.0,So the RAM which I got is a single rank RAM x16 not the x8 which is gives slightly more performance. Otherwise RAM is good and it's a original crucial one. Seller need to specify which type they are sending so that we can decide before purchase.
2265,5.0,"Very good Ram
Original ram"
2266,4.0,Bought this RAM for my HP victus laptop R5 5600H( GPU:RTX3050). Working like a Charm. Rrcognised by the os. (Windows11)
2267,5.0,"Purchase Price - 1950₹
CL 22 - 3200Mhz - Single Rank Memory Kit

I'm fine by it being single Rank don't have time to invest in getting that additional 5-10% by searching for Dual Rank Stick
Had a reasonable boost 10-15% in My laptop going from 1x8 to 2x8 Ram Config
Mostly it's more Smoother than Higher Performance"
2268,4.0,"I received the dual rank 16GB memory stick, just what I wanted!"
2269,5.0,"I ordered 2 sticks of dual-rank Ram from different sellers as it got out of stock for one seller. But I received one dual-rank and another single-rank (as you can see in the images above). Which did make me a little upset but soon after contacting Amazon and the seller my issue got resolved and I got a full refund for it so now I'm happy again.

Now, coming to the products I'm happy with the products as after installing the rams my beast (Predator Helios 300 PH315-53) became more responsive and usable for work.

For those who might be wondering why someone may need 32 GB of Ram then I did say there are several reasons and cases you may need it. Specifically, if you are a coder who works on large projects and has to run several emulations simultaneously which was the case for me, increasing the ram helped me a lot by speeding up my work. Some things are impossible to work on 16GB no matter how much you try.

So, go with 32 GB if you think you may need it. The price difference is not much in comparison to the time you may waste due to a slow system with frequent crashes when working."
2270,4.0,Now my laptop become faster then before
2271,5.0,Will update if anything happens
2272,5.0,Absolutely great. Very very good performance. 3200mhz with my ryzen 5 4600h is showing its power.
2273,5.0,Best ram for gaming
2274,5.0,"Previous I had a 8GB DDR4 3200MT/s, 1Rx8 and was planning to upgrade my system from many months
This RAM is 16GB with 1Rx8 configuration. (Rest all the values like CAS, latency etc are same) means both RAM are single channel individually and running at flex mode(better than single channel and close to dual channel) right now.

Currently my PC is operating in 24GB RAM. I ran windows memory diagnosis, UEFI memory check and found no issues.

To know your RAM details
Download Thaiphoon Burner
then click on Read > Report - you will get every detail here.

Copy ""DRAM Component"" column data and search it on google, to get the datasheet.

Pls verify all data on Thaiphoon Burner with physical dies of RAM (by taking photo of it before installing on laptop)"
2275,5.0,"Product is good and working perfectly.
My current existing ram is sk hynix CL22 single rank x16 and adding crucial ram with this matching perfectly with existing timings and cas latency.

With 16GB ram bandwidth doubles and performance also increased. Only cons is it's slower ram (single rank x16) compare to dual rank x8. Crucial should mention whether it's single rank or dual rank with x8 or x16 in Amazon or their own official site because it just confuse end users and ended up getting slower ram."
2276,5.0,"Working fine with my acer nitro 5 4600h which has 8gb of 3200mhz ram installed and i have installed this crucial 8gb ram and its working fine it shows 2X64 bit chennal (Dual chennal) in cpuz

earlier it was working only single chennal with only 8 gb ram

now its showing 16gb (15.4 gb due to ryzen 5 4600h cos its uses 500mb ram for its i gpu)"

My experience of installing ram quite easy
But when i boot the laptop for the 1st time after ram installation display doesn't show any thing.then i reset my battery form back of my laptop pannel form battery hole. Then it work fine
At start bios will take some time to , to set the timing of ram"
2417,5.0,"This 4GB RAM is 2666Mhz SDRAM with latency of CAS 19. It can function as 2400Mhz RAM with latency of CAS 17 in case you already have a 2400Mhz RAM in another slot or your bus don't support 2666Mhz as in case of AMD laptop CPUs which only upto support 2400Mhz.

You can install this RAM in your laptop only if you have an extra empty SODIMM slot or if your current RAM is damaged and you want to replace it. Many laptops nowadays come with soldered RAM which can't be removed or upgraded and in such cases, this RAM is not to be bought. Also, one must take care that the RAM slot is DDR4 and not any other type as DDR4 RAM will not fit in DDR3 or DDR2 slots.

Dual channel support-
There is a misconception that dual channel requires 2 identical RAM of same size, same brand and latency. This is only partly true. One van easily install 4Gb RAM along with another 8GB RAM (or even 16GB RAM) and still get a partial dual channel mode called ""FLEX"" channel where 4GB from both RAM sticks will be in dual channel while the extra RAM will be in single channel. The performance difference between dual channel and flex channel is minimal at about 2% FPS reduction when playing games. But the cost difference is about Rs 1300. If one doesn't need 16GB RAM, then installing 8+4 = 12GB RAM is enough and one doesn't have to fear loss of dual channel and save some money in the process. I myself have installed this RAM along with another 8GB SAMSUNG RAM. One has to only ensure that that CAS latency and Mhz speed to be identical to ensure maximum performance in flex channel mode.

The performance of Crucial RAM and SAMSUNG RAM appears identical in all the benchmark tests I have run. The only negative is that Crucial only offers 3 year warranty whereas companies like ADATA offers 10 year warranty."
2418,5.0,I got it for 3.9k which I think is value for money for an 500 GB SSD because I got it in sale and it got installed really well although I got it done from my nearby local shop but it is perfectly fitted and made my laptop quite smooth.

But when I checked partslookup website of lenovo it was showing 16GB Ram compatible but the models were different so I went on to crucial and checked RAM compatibility and crucial website suggested me this RAM stick.

Both my RAMs are running in dual channel at 3200MHz without any problems..

My review, go for it, great product,
-1 star for late delivery"
2510,5.0,"Purchased 2 SoDIMM sticks of GSkill Ripjaws. Each having a total capacity of 16GB ( Total 32GB ).
Both sticks were single rank, verified using HWinfo and CPUz, and the values associated with timings are 22-22-22-52.
Each memory stick has 4 NAND Flash memory banks on each side of the stick. Thus the two sticks combined have a total of 16 black chips equally distributed on both sides of respective memory modules.
This memory is Non-ECC.
RAM Sticks do not have any temperature reading functionality hence you'll not be able to see the temperature of your RAM Modules once they're running in laptop.
Stress testing ensures that the RAM does not heat mych even during continuous heavy usage so you don't have to worry about temperatures or overheating issues.
Make sure your laptop manufacturer has clearly stated the maximum memory capacity of the laptop. Mine was 32 and I need more than 24 GB memory when working with different things so I maxed out my system.
Shipping takes A LOT of time but I guess it cannot be helped.

I had to return previous shipment and order it again (Waiting for refund from previous order) as those sticks were working initially but one of them was faulty resulting in memory related crashes in both Windows10 and Linux.
I verified the faulty stick using MemTest86 software and placed return within 5 hours of receiving order. The faulty stick failed in Test 1 and Test 13 accumulating over 300 errors in just a single pass.

I recommend everyone to fully test their memory modules independently using memtest86 to ensure they recieve correct products as sometimes the faulty RAM sticks also boot until they hit faulty addresses.

Overall, very satisfied with the product. If it fails in less than 4 years from the time of this review then I'll make sure to edit this review and mention it here. Until then, assume that this particular product is working flawlessly and you can purchase it. It is a pretty good investment.

My laptop is Acer Aspire 7 ( A715-42G ) with Ryzen 5 5500U with GTX 1650 and the max memory capacity is 32GB incase anyone needs the info. There are pretty good options out there in market but this gets my work done for a very reasonable price."

2512,5.0,If you're looking for a ram for upgrade then buy this...i thought that maybe others brands will be same as rx8 but they can be rx16 so don't go for that...instead of crucial.. Kingston buy this gskill ripjaws...i have compared the latency and the timings and let me tell you it's the lowest in both(lowest is better)
2513,4.0,Using this RAM on my omen 15 en0001AX. Works without any issues with the existing stock 8gb RAM.
2514,5.0,Fastest ram
2515,5.0,"I used this G.Skill DDR4 3200Mhz SODIMM RAM kit for my Ideapad Gaming 3 (5600H, GTX 1650). It only came with 8GB RAM preinstalled, and as a result the gaming performance on this laptop suffered immensely.
As a result, I chose the G.Skill RAM kit to install in my system, and it worked perfectly with no extra steps required. The computer did take slightly more time than it usually takes, when initially booting after installing the ram, but I could not replicate the issue again, so its safe to say that has been taken care of.

The RAM timings do match the existing ram, and you even get a bonus G.Skill sticker to put onto your laptop.

I havent really tested a load of games on the laptop after the upgrade, hence I'll make sure to update the review with performance stats after some testing.

To sum this product up, it does its job well at a reasonable price for high freq SODIMM RAM (2999 INR), and I do not have any complaints regarding the product and the delivery."

This is 👍 good ram.

2521,4.0,"At first I was scared to mix 2 different RAMs in my laptop, but the exact Samsung RAM is not available. So used CPU-Z to see all the information about my RAM and then tried searching for similar ones. This had same CAS latency as my preinstalled RAM which is 22. After reading old comments found that the DRAM manufacturer is Samsung itself, which again matched my preinstalled one. Then I saw awesome deal on this RAM and got it for Rs. 2,590. It was impossible to pass on this deal. Installing the RAM was no problem at all and really easy, but make sure to check out a few tutorials first. Tested on GoW4, fps increased from about 65-70 to 75-80. Cinebench R23 score increased by about 100 points. Rust was hard to run on 8 GB RAM, but after upgrade can run it at 80 fps with no problem.(Game settings are medium)"

2523,5.0,This is totally compatible with lenovo legion but just for extra surety check clock speed and type of your ram
2524,5.0,"It is x16 ram 'coz it has 4 chips on either side . However if we can see the Fury model from Kingston it has 8 chips on either side which is x8 ram model .
However putting it in to my Dell G15 (which unexpectedly already have one x16 ram) draws me doule the fps in games. Like I was getting 60 fps in GTA on high settings before installing and after installation it gave me 120 fps constant.

So, great performance but it is x16."
2525,5.0,"I WAS THINKING ABOUT UPGRADING MY RAM AS MY PC SEEMS TO BE USING 70%+ RAM AND GETTING A BIT LAGGY. I READ A LOT OF REVIEWS ABOUT DUAL CHANNELS AND MOST SAID DUAL CHANNEL WON'T WORK IF WE MIX TWO DIFFERENT BRANDS BUT THE DEFAULT SAMSUNG DD4 3200MHZ RAM WAS UNAVAILABLE IN INDIA SO I HAD TO TAKE THE RISK OF TESTING GSKILL BUT IT JUST WOWED ME AND NOW I HAVE A WHOPPING 40GIGS OF RAM ON MY LAPTOP. EVERYTHING TURNED BUTTERY SMOOTH APP OPENINGS RUNNING MULTIPLE IDE, MULTI CODING ON SQL, PYTHON, R STUDIO WAS RUNNING SIMULTANEOUSLY ALONG WITH DATA VISUALIZATION TOOLS LIKE TABLEAU, POWERBI, ETC. AT MUCH EASE BACK TO BACK. THIS IS A MUCH RECOMMENDED BUY FOR THOSE WHO HAVE RELATIVELY HIGH RESOURCE UTILIZATION AND THIS WILL MAKE YOUR WORKFLOW BETTER.

2527,4.0,"Oh boy this is gonna be a very long detailed answer for every 8gb ram and why you should upgrade your ram from single channel 8gb to 16gb dual channel I am also gonna provide some games with fps reached before and after the ram upgrade.
I have an asus tuf a15 r7 4800H 1650ti.

1.Cyberpunk 2077
Without ram upgrade- low 30fps(with stuttering)
Medium-15fps with stuttering every time.
With ram upgrade- low 60fps easy with no stutter
Medium-35fps constant everywhere no stutter.
High- between 25 to 30 fps.
Ultra- 15 to 20 fps (unplayable) without stutter.

2. GTA5
(In story mode)
Without ram upgrade- high 60 to 65 fps with stuttering
With ram upgrade- high 90+ fps everywhere many times touching 100 fps and more. No stuttering

3. Valorant

With ram upgrade- 160 to 210 on all high without any stuttering.

4. Fortnite
Without ram upgrade- 60 to 75 fps on all ultra settings. With some stuttering in between.
With ram upgrade- 90+ fps an on all ultra no stuttering.

5. Watch dogs 2
Without ram upgrade- 10 to 30 fps on all high and ultra combo with constant stuttering in between.
With ram upgrade- 45 to 60 fps on all high and ultra combo without any stuttering.

2529,5.0,Great product. Seller sent the product with actual bill of the purchased item. Although the delivery was not from Amazon itself. I was sceptical whether it will run at 3200 clock speed without xmp but it does. Bought this for my Legion 5 which already had a Samsung 1rx8 ram. This also has 1rx8 configuration. Go for it.
2530,5.0,"Got this stick for just 2550 if you are getting it at higher price than this then you should wait for a while.... Untill price drops.
If your are a tech enthusiastic..
Then an advice for you - Don't worry about miss- matching of ram or cas latency etc.... Just check out the frequency... That's it...
I know you are thinking, I am a stupid... But believe me you will barely notice 1 or 2 fps difference even in the worst scenarios..... So don't waste your money and time in finding a perfect match for your ram."
2531,5.0,"So i had bought asus tuf a15 2021 model with 8gb single channel ram, i used it a couple of months n figured ill use it for a couple of months n see if need another ram. After couple of months of usage you can use it only for medium or low settings in most games. Hiwever after the installation of 2nd ram im seeing a 20-30% fps boost. This is pretty easy to install. I bought it at 2.5k so it was valuebfor money. My advice is to wait for a minth or so n watch for price to drop to around 2.5k. otherwise i think cost of 3k n more is too much."
2532,5.0,"I installed this on my Acer Aspire 7 and can confirm it does work. The one already on the system was 2666Mhz so to use it as dual channel this ram also lowered its speed. However its worth upgrading especially with this price and brand.

Go for it.

This in USA sells for about ₹2.4k and sells in India for less then ₹3k, while the crucial one sells in USA for about ₹2.7k and is selling in India for about ₹3.7k. You can now make your choice. Remember, I am only talking about this 8gb stick, seeing the way ram is going these days, one shouldnt be surprised if 16gb varient of this ram would perform differently.

8 GB 3200MHz CL22 RAM (From Hynix)

Installation is very easy, packaging was proper, no signs of damage or usage.
Both my RAMs are running in dual channel at 3200MHz without any problems..

My review, go for it, great product,
-1 star for late delivery"
2560,5.0,"Purchased 2 SoDIMM sticks of GSkill Ripjaws. Each having a total capacity of 16GB ( Total 32GB ).
Both sticks were single rank, verified using HWinfo and CPUz, and the values associated with timings are 22-22-22-52.
Each memory stick has 4 NAND Flash memory banks on each side of the stick. Thus the two sticks combined have a total of 16 black chips equally distributed on both sides of respective memory modules.
This memory is Non-ECC.
RAM Sticks do not have any temperature reading functionality hence you'll not be able to see the temperature of your RAM Modules once they're running in laptop.
Stress testing ensures that the RAM does not heat mych even during continuous heavy usage so you don't have to worry about temperatures or overheating issues.
Make sure your laptop manufacturer has clearly stated the maximum memory capacity of the laptop. Mine was 32 and I need more than 24 GB memory when working with different things so I maxed out my system.
Shipping takes A LOT of time but I guess it cannot be helped.

I had to return previous shipment and order it again (Waiting for refund from previous order) as those sticks were working initially but one of them was faulty resulting in memory related crashes in both Windows10 and Linux.
I verified the faulty stick using MemTest86 software and placed return within 5 hours of receiving order. The faulty stick failed in Test 1 and Test 13 accumulating over 300 errors in just a single pass.

I recommend everyone to fully test their memory modules independently using memtest86 to ensure they recieve correct products as sometimes the faulty RAM sticks also boot until they hit faulty addresses.

Overall, very satisfied with the product. If it fails in less than 4 years from the time of this review then I'll make sure to edit this review and mention it here. Until then, assume that this particular product is working flawlessly and you can purchase it. It is a pretty good investment.

My laptop is Acer Aspire 7 ( A715-42G ) with Ryzen 5 5500U with GTX 1650 and the max memory capacity is 32GB incase anyone needs the info. There are pretty good options out there in market but this gets my work done for a very reasonable price."
2561,4.0,"I Like This Ram because Its Is Manufacture By Samsung. It's 3200 mhz Amazing Performance Its Increase My . GAMING FPS 88 To 140 Fps.
It's very Cheap Only- ₹2,150. Good Product in This Price."
2562,4.0,If you're looking for a ram for upgrade then buy this...i thought that maybe others brands will be same as rx8 but they can be rx16 so don't go for that...instead of crucial.. Kingston buy this gskill ripjaws...i have compared the latency and the timings and let me tell you it's the lowest in both(lowest is better)
2563,3.0,Using this RAM on my omen 15 en0001AX. Works without any issues with the existing stock 8gb RAM.
2564,5.0,Fastest ram
2565,5.0,"I used this G.Skill DDR4 3200Mhz SODIMM RAM kit for my Ideapad Gaming 3 (5600H, GTX 1650). It only came with 8GB RAM preinstalled, and as a result the gaming performance on this laptop suffered immensely.
As a result, I chose the G.Skill RAM kit to install in my system, and it worked perfectly with no extra steps required. The computer did take slightly more time than it usually takes, when initially booting after installing the ram, but I could not replicate the issue again, so its safe to say that has been taken care of.

The RAM timings do match the existing ram, and you even get a bonus G.Skill sticker to put onto your laptop.

I havent really tested a load of games on the laptop after the upgrade, hence I'll make sure to update the review with performance stats after some testing.

To sum this product up, it does its job well at a reasonable price for high freq SODIMM RAM (2999 INR), and I do not have any complaints regarding the product and the delivery."

For ram density this is 1r×8,1rx8 provide better bandwidth over 1r×16 but other type latency of 1r×16 is very better than 1 r×8 and Ryzen processesor work effectively with high bandwidth ram and some time Intel also.
Conclusion:-
This is 👍 good ram.
But if your budget is little higer than this then must go of kingston hyperx 2×8 gb =16gb ram pack."
2568,5.0,IT MAKES GAMING WAY SMOOTHER THAN 8GB RAM AND BETTER.

2570,5.0,Easy to setup. I didnt experience any screen flickering. Just takes 10-15 seconds on first boot.
2571,5.0,"At first I was scared to mix 2 different RAMs in my laptop, but the exact Samsung RAM is not available. So used CPU-Z to see all the information about my RAM and then tried searching for similar ones. This had same CAS latency as my preinstalled RAM which is 22. After reading old comments found that the DRAM manufacturer is Samsung itself, which again matched my preinstalled one. Then I saw awesome deal on this RAM and got it for Rs. 2,590. It was impossible to pass on this deal. Installing the RAM was no problem at all and really easy, but make sure to check out a few tutorials first. Tested on GoW4, fps increased from about 65-70 to 75-80. Cinebench R23 score increased by about 100 points. Rust was hard to run on 8 GB RAM, but after upgrade can run it at 80 fps with no problem.(Game settings are medium)"
2572,5.0,Worked perfectly for me my dell g15 5511
2573,5.0,This is totally compatible with lenovo legion but just for extra surety check clock speed and type of your ram
2574,5.0,"It is x16 ram 'coz it has 4 chips on either side . However if we can see the Fury model from Kingston it has 8 chips on either side which is x8 ram model .
However putting it in to my Dell G15 (which unexpectedly already have one x16 ram) draws me doule the fps in games. Like I was getting 60 fps in GTA on high settings before installing and after installation it gave me 120 fps constant.

So, great performance but it is x16."
2575,4.0,"I WAS THINKING ABOUT UPGRADING MY RAM AS MY PC SEEMS TO BE USING 70%+ RAM AND GETTING A BIT LAGGY. I READ A LOT OF REVIEWS ABOUT DUAL CHANNELS AND MOST SAID DUAL CHANNEL WON'T WORK IF WE MIX TWO DIFFERENT BRANDS BUT THE DEFAULT SAMSUNG DD4 3200MHZ RAM WAS UNAVAILABLE IN INDIA SO I HAD TO TAKE THE RISK OF TESTING GSKILL BUT IT JUST WOWED ME AND NOW I HAVE A WHOPPING 40GIGS OF RAM ON MY LAPTOP. EVERYTHING TURNED BUTTERY SMOOTH APP OPENINGS RUNNING MULTIPLE IDE, MULTI CODING ON SQL, PYTHON, R STUDIO WAS RUNNING SIMULTANEOUSLY ALONG WITH DATA VISUALIZATION TOOLS LIKE TABLEAU, POWERBI, ETC. AT MUCH EASE BACK TO BACK. THIS IS A MUCH RECOMMENDED BUY FOR THOSE WHO HAVE RELATIVELY HIGH RESOURCE UTILIZATION AND THIS WILL MAKE YOUR WORKFLOW BETTER.

2969,4.0,"It's been 15 days since i using the device extensively.
I bought it on the Last freedom sale for Rs. 41,999 ( including 6k instant discount coupon).
First let me be clear , I bought ' S20 FE 5G 'with Snapdragon 865 , not ' S20 FE with Exynos ' and i am a user who uses phone most of the time .
This review may be long but it's worth to read it if you're buying this product.
Let me divide between the Pros and Cons.
First i would like like to start with Pros of the Device ,
Pros :
1. Display :
Samsung has been already popular for it's AMOLED Displays but i saw some of the reviewers wrote about some display issues here . They might have got some defective Piece. I have no issues with my display . It's been long time i saw a great display like this ... with 120Hz it is Super Smooth.
Also , it is very bright on outdoors and can decrease it to very low while using at low light conditions ( PS : No tint issues )
The in display finger print scanner is very fast and didn't faced any issues with it .

2. Stereo Speakers :
As an extensive multimedia user , this is one of the most favorable feature for me.
Believe me , you can't find any other device with such great Sound quality in this price segment , it's almost like flagship devices ..
Both the speakers are adequately loud.

3. Battery :
As a person who's shifting from a normal 60Hz Device phone , i was very worried about the battery life of this device at 120Hz but it surprised me very well ..
Initially i thought i would need to switch to 60Hz for better battery life for daily usage.
But I didn't even thought this device would give this much great battery life at 120Hz.
At 120Hz , I am getting around 7 hours of minimum SOT ( Screen on Time ).
The maximum SOT i got at 120Hz is 9Hours 13 minutes.
I didn't checked battery life at 60Hz because i didn't use it at 60Hz even a single day . The battery life is Excellent.

4. Rear Cameras :
I am not a very good photographer or something , i am just an ordinary person who use camera occasionally.
I was very excited to use the telephoto lens which only can be found on flagship devices and it performs very well..
Added Some Camera Samples above ( Pic 1 : Ultrawide , Pic 2 : Telephoto [ Pic may not be clear as it was when taken due to compression of the image while uploading )
Both the three Cameras ( Primary + Ultrawide + Telephoto ) performs very well.
If you're a camera guy you should definitely check this out.

5. Performance & RAM Management :
I'm not a gamer , I use my device for daily usage of social media , ott platforms , Calls , messages etc. but i use it extremely.
I didn't faced any kind of heating issues with the device until now.
Also ,Ram management of the Device is excellent , I am a person who uses 4-5 apps
background at single time and i didn't have any issues of closing down the apps .

6. ONE UI :
I was a stock Android guy , but One UI actually surprised me , it is very well optimised and very user-friendly for single hand usage..
initial days i found it little hard to use the stock menu of one Ui but I'm now got used to it.
PS : I didn't found any kind of ads on my device as i didn't sign up or used any samsung Apps.

7. Build Quality :
Even though its back is made up of plastic , the overall build quality is super Premium the Aluminium frame gives us a feel like using a flagship device..

8. Future Proof :
The device has 9 5G Bands , IP68 Rating , Wireless Charging which are very hard to find on any device in this price bracket.
IP68 & Wireless Charging are mostly only found on Flagship Devices . Its good to see samsung brings it at lower price.
This is the best future proof device as of now.

So these are the Major pros i noticed as of now .
Now let's move to the Cons.

Cons :
1. NO HDR SUPPORT ON NETFLIX :
As an extensive multimedia user , i found it very frustrating. even mid range devices offering HDR support on Netflix , Samsungs Flagship Killer doesn't have HDR support.
IT WILL NOT BE FIXED VIA OTA UPDATE .

2. No 256GB Variant :
This is actually not a problem for most of the people but as a power user who uses Dual sim , i found it little difficult.
But if you're a single sim user , luckily it have hybrid solution ..
so you can use a Sim card + expandable memory card ...

3. Gorilla Glass 3 :
Other competitors are providing atleast GG5 in this price range. But S20 FE 5G has just GG3 ( Which also I'm not sure as it is not mentioned officially anywhere ).
But at the end of the day , GLASS IS GLASS & IT WILL BROKE.

4. No headphone Jack :
It is not any kind of unusual thing .
most of the phones above 30K segment doesn't have headphone jack.
So we have to buy 3.5mm to Type C adapter , type c earphones or bluetooth solutions .
Note : Only Buy original Samsung type c adapter else it may not support.

5. No 25W charger :
It is not actually a con for me as i prefer Low watt charger which is good for battery health and beneficial for long term usage .
but it may be a con for you ,
Although the device supports 25W charging . Only 15W charger is provided inside the box .. They should have given 25W inside the box.
I didn't have any issues with 15W charger but it would be great if they bundle it with 25W as competitors are way ahead in terms of charging speed.
For the reference of Charging speed ,
Both 15W & 25W will full charge the device almost at the same time but using 25W you can get about 50% within 30 minutes where as 30% with 15W charger.
Full charge time i usually takes is 1hour and 35 minutes.

6. Front Camera :
I am not a selfie guy , but if you're a person who's looking for a selfie device just don't buy it . it's not like the front camera quality is really bad or anything but it's not even near to the rear camera quality and you can find better selfie smartphones in this price range

CONCLUSION :
If you're a person who wants a device for normal day to day usage with good battery life , great rear cameras , great performance , better software support , better build quality and use it for more than 3 years & the cons mentioned above doesn't bother you
Just buy it , I am sure you won't be disappointed."
2970,4.0,"It's been about 15 days since I got this phone. I got it for 29990 on prime day sale. For the price it's good.
Pros :
1. Camera. Coming from Poco X2, the camera quality on this is amazing according to the price. It gives you good colours, contrast, focus, and everything that you want. It has OIS which is very apparent while recording. At 4k60 the stability is worse. But set it to 1080p60 and the videos will be amazingly stable. And the main advantage of OIS other than stable video is GREAT night mode shots. Hold the phone stable for a while and along with OIS you will get great photos with accurate colors and nice exposure. Attached samples.

2. Display : Absolutely best. Samsung displays are the best. 120hz FHD. Flows smoothly. Colors and calibration is top notch. Brightness is good but I felt it's a little insufficient under direct sunlight. It's visible but could be better.
3. OneUI : The main reason for upgrading to this phone was software. OneUI4.0 is the absolute best android skin right now. It has way too many customisations in it and let's you personalise your phone to a very high degree. Like there's a feature to read out the name of the person who's calling if your wearing headphones. It took me 3 days to fully go through all the settings and change them to my needs. Also Knoxx security is a special mention. Knoxx security is a software and hardware feature in samsung phones which protects your phone from all kinds of attacks and keeps your data safe. Even if it gets stolen you can remotely delete all your data. Secure folder allows you to store data in a separate storage. And many more such good features. While being a very feature rich and storage heavy skin, it still feels very very smooth and fast to use. Unlike MIUI or other skins, it doesn't stutter much and bugs are less.
There are many other small pros like good stereo speakers. Nice premium build quality. Good data and wifi speeds. Other such features that you won't notice but definitely make a difference in your experience.

Cons
1. Software. I know I said it's a pro but I say this in the aspect of updates. This phone was launched in 2021 March in India and samsung promises 3 year android version updates and 1 additional year of security updates. But there's a lot of confusion regarding if or not this phone will receive Android 14. It will receive A13 for sure. There's a lot of debate on what they will do with14 because of global version launch date being earlier and yada yada. Basically the phones life maybe 2.5 to 3 years if they give a14. But 1.5 to 2 if not. I researched on the Internet a few people say that it will receive a14 while I was few say it's not. It's hard to say who's correct. So assume it's not getting a14 if you are going for it.
2. Battery. The battery on this phone is 4500mah and it's good enough for a days use. But that's because I use it lightly. Not much online streaming. No gaming light social media and other usual stuff. If you use it even a tad bit more heavily, you will run out within a day. If you're going outside for the better part of a day,like a day trip to somewhere nearby,it's better keep a power bank handy. In terms of Screen on time numbers, I once got 7 hours of sot on light usage, 1 hr YouTube and 1.5 hr streaming. I was at home and used wifi all the time.
I got 3 hrs sot when I went outside for a day trip. I took many photos and videos and the phone shutdown before I could reach home. On a mixed use day, you can get 4.5 to 5.5 hours of sot.

Final verdict : The life of the phone in terms of Software Support is not great but you will get on time updates and almost no bugs in the software. So if you want to buy it you can and exchange it after maybe 2 years for other models. But if you planning on using it for longer than 2 years, better avoid it. In the upcoming diwali and dussera sales, the price might further drop to 25k even. I am just speculating but keep in mind your requirements and go accordingly.
As always amazing delivery by Amazon."
2971,4.0,"To begin with, I had to return the initial product delivered to me. It had minor bumps on the left side of the screen in the (edgy) place where the screen is fitted to the body but had no other problems with it functionally. I made a complaint call to amazon and got my replacement the same day itself. I have been using the replacement for a week now.

Overall cost was around 31k INR via coupons & Amazon Summer Sale'22.

First and foremost, I had made a conscious decision to replace this phone by the end of they year even before I clicked the purchase button because I somehow felt that I was very late to buy it (was released in 2020; and the 2022 variant is not available in India so far). But the handset is impressive and those of you looking for a future proof phone, this product will definitely be viable for another couple of years at the least if not more.

Its a bit lengthy and definitely is chunkier than most phones I have handled (which is actually not that many; definitely no flagships or ultras) but the weight is nicely distributed and is very comfortable to hold. However, the finish both front and back despite looking so elegant are prone to be muddled by finger prints (I constantly wipe the screen and back with a micro fiber cloth just to admire it in its pristine form ;p).

Display is extra-ordinary (120 Hz by default). Perhaps it is the USP of this product and Samsung screens are anyway the golden standard in this part of the globe at least. Smooth screen transitions, buttery responsive to touch (can be adjusted). Overall display and screen are flagship-grade. I am very careful with most of my electronics so the gorilla glass 3 (I have seen some reviews where people have dropped this phone and completely lost their screen - usually through shattering) does not really bother me and there is no direct impact on resolution or touch as far as I am concerned.

The snapdragon 865 compliments the screen and display with good handling of most common applications, the phone OS and the manufacturer specific features. I have never had any stutter or slowness so far but then it has only been a week and I will update this section after a few months of usage. There was noticeable heating while setting up the phone and never after that

I am in no means a power user (but the SD865 is making me feel like one :p). I consume high amounts of streaming media, moderate time with messenger & email apps and the occasional games and I can say that my phone sees moderate to less screen-on time on a regular day. The battery is fit enough and more to handle these requirements and the 8GB RAM is sufficient. I plan to do some stress tests on the battery and RAM; will add the outcomes in the next update to this review. The charging is also fast (via the in box 15W adapter) and I have not plugged in my phone more than once in 48 hrs (for a full charge-discharge cycle: 100% to 10%).

The cameras for which I had no expectations because I am not a big user of them seem to be a very big step up from my Nokia 6.1. Good colors when there is sufficient lighting around, good quality of zoomed in/out pics; adequate for a user like me and from the reviews I have heard of the phone they can be punchy enough to produce some magical shots in the hands of a knowledgeable user.

Audio is excellent; could not expect more. Strong but filtered output from the receiver even if I keep the phone around my ears instead of pressing them against the ears. The bottom speaker is also sturdy and it pairs well with the receiver to produce a fluent stereo experience. I have already moved on from the 3.5mm jack; I am using the Samsung buds pro and loving it.

So as you may have observed, I have just graduated to a no-compromise midship segment of smartphones and my next handset will definitely be a pure flagship. The S20 FE has in its first week, made a great impression and I do not see myself going back to budget or mid range phones from here (that in my opinion is a good impact for a fan edition handset).

People, this is a very underrated phone (S21 FE seems like an unimpressive hollywood sequel to the S20 FE as per my understanding). Go for this phone - it is a blessing at the 30-40k range for users like me who are looking to move up towards the flagship experience."
2972,5.0,"Battery charging speed is the only negative point , it takes one hour 40 mins for 0 to 100% with the 15w adapter they provided in the box , display is average not that much vibrant samsung display is always good but not this one , in outdoor the display brightness is not upto the level , camera quality is top notch , design is so good , i didn't expected that much for the design, but really impressed for the design in hand feel is very good, I satisfied with the Mobile except the display and the battery"
2973,4.0,"Purchased samsung S20 FE for my brother, totally happy with the festive price and Samsung never disappoints the purchase
Only thing that would have been good was battery capacity, fact that fast charging was supported, but the charger could have been type C to type C. Where as USB to type C was given this phone which is sad. Love the camera quality as it gives best shots with primary sensors and amazing selfie cam."
2974,4.0,"Pros:-
#Cameras in videos and photos both
#Display Amoled 👌
#Sterieo Speakers Dual mics while recording
#lag free Perfomance
#One Ui some features like objecteraser, inbuilt video editor, gallery organizer,remaster s22 ultra feature etc
#wireless & Reverse wireless charging and ip68 Bonus
Price is big 👍 Got it for 27k during Diwali sale 30k is also better price for this device

Small Cons:-
#Charging Speed it takes 1.5 hour from 15% to 100%
#battery backup heavy use 5hours
Normal use YouTube insta etc igets 6 to7hours
#Fingerprint hit or miss sometimes
#Front camera for photos not that great for videos ok 4k 60fps
#Outdoor sunlight visibility was ok"
2975,4.0,"Cons
1. U can't have a 'guest account/second space' (realme /mi have it to use all second app like KITE to install)
2. Cant use 2nd sim or memory card together
3. Camera is good but AI beautification (for selfie etc) is not there. U hav to edit if u need those as it clicks original. Girls did not like selfie cam.

Pros
Rest all(battery, display, ui) good."
2976,4.0,"Pro.
Camera- Rear camera are one among the best performing in the market
Performance- Flagship level
UI-less bloatwares
Con
Battery getting drained very fastly.
they could have given a 45w charging instead of 25 and inside 15w charger.
Display with less brightness.
Heating if you are using mobile data even if there no activities hence they had given a separate 5G modem inside.
If you are using wifi data there is no heating.

Verdict
Purchase this if you need a camera phone with best performance and less battery backup"
2977,4.0,"pros-
1) CAMERAS- almost flagship level quality, no nonsensical cameras, almost all flagship features, manageable cutout
2) DESIGN- it's simple matt finish design; not clumsy and shining like most phones now a days
3) FEATURES- almost all flagship level features incl. IP 68, wireless charging, etc.
4) CUSTOMIZATION- insane level of customisation any phone can do. it'll take weeks to try all CUSTOMIZATION features for normal users
5) light weight
6) SPEED- earlier samsung used to be slow but now a days ONE UI has changed the picture, especially this one is SD 865; no heating issues as such for average users.
plus 120 hz display with S-AMOLED feels so fast and smooth like butter
7) most of the bloatwares can be deleted
8) SOUND- enough for day to day task+ dolby atmos feels so awesome bcs of stereo speakers
9) SOFT. UPDATES- almost each month. samsung has now become the king in software update
10) 5G- it's 5g ready with enough band unlike most phones with 1-2 bands.

CONS-
1) battery back-up- average( though can be managed throughout the day for average users)
2) average battery back-up coupled with average charging speed
3) night mode isn't working after the update
4) the chin is noticeable

CONCLUSION-
plastic back( though very good quality and seems glass), little bezels, etc is understandable for me as this is almost flagship level phone with mid range level price tag. i got it @below 30k+ card disc. which is such a respectable price tag for this phone. no other phone(even 2022 released phone) can stand a chance in this price range.
believe me if you're no frills, logical person who understands the real use of a smartphone, this phone is for you.
otherwise, there're phones with 5-6 cameras and 8 inch displays with 7k power batteries with no actual use and average quality like oneplus now a days.
also, i ignored s21 fe bcs of EXYNOS and design.

Enjoy the precious life.

edit- night mode issue solved after update"
2978,4.0,It is a wonderful mobile mainly in camera performance was very impressively and i am big fan of Samsung mobiles that's why i bought this mobile and i am fully satisfied but there is some cons also there like battery was drained early and charge mobile twice a day and fingerprint was slowly however overall product was very good and reasonable to buy
2979,4.0,"Writing this review after 3 months of usage.
Will divide this review into pros and cons.

First, the Pros:
1.Software and One UI-Many people complain that One UI is bloated and it's bad compared to stock android or other brands.This is not the case, It comes with a lot of useful features like improved security (knox) and app management. There are no ADS apart from a couple of apps like weather which can be disabled, Also, ads will be disabled in future updates. Samsung also is excellent in providing software and security updates,with 3years software support.So you won't feel let down on the software experience.
2.Performance-Snapdragon 865 is Snappy and efficient, no lags whatsoever Can handle heavy applications and games thanks to 8 GB RAM, improved thermal and battery performance compared to exynos variant.Lot of people complaining about Samsung phones heating up, There is a difference between getting warm and heating up. This device never heats up and getting warm is normal on any smartphone. this is not the case only with Samsung but I have used phones from other brands and they too get warm after using it for an hour or so continuously.
. I'm not a samsung fan but criticizing a product without proper research can prevent prospective users from buying good products.
3.Network Connectivity: Have used the phone while traveling and did not experience network drops, Radio reception is very good and call experience was great.
4.Camera: This device comes with good set of cameras (triple camera)and takes great pictures, Samsung's camera optimization is good compared to competition at this price point.
5.Sound and Media experience: Excellent sound output thanks to dual stereo speakers, watching media even without a headset is a great experience. Comes with dolby atmos support. Amazing experience with galaxy buds 2 which you can buy separately.
6.Display-Samoled Display is amazing. Supports upto 120hz refresh rate which makes things buttery smooth.The color reproduction is excellent and samsung makes displays for other renowned brands.Supports HDR videos, tested on YouTube but doesn't work on Netflix because Netflix has to certify the device and not a problem with the device. Overall, media consumption has been a great experience.
7.Great build quality: The phone can survive a few drops. Front is corning gorilla glass 3 back is premium plastic with metal frame. The phone is also IP68 certified for dust and water resistance.
8.Battery: This is not exactly a pro but included in the pro section because there are a lot of people criticizing battery life. The battery performance is neither a pro nor a con, similar to other devices available at this price point.The device has a 4500 MAH battery and easily lasts a day and half with heavy to moderate use and standby will last even longer, I charge the phone once a day, which is similar to all the smartphones in this price range. You can easily expect a screen on time of 7 to 8 hours which not really something that deserves criticizing.
9.5G ready with 9 5g bands.

Cons:
1. Only 15 watt charger included in the box by samsung which takes atleast 1.5 hours to charge the phone. Could have been better with atleast a 25 watt charger in the box. When competitors are providing 30+ watt chargers in this price range.
2.Fingerprint scanner: comes with an in display fingerprint sensor which works well most of the time but it is clumsy at times.
3.Average front camera.

Verdict: value for money smartphone at this pricepoint. A good smartphone investment for the next couple or 3 years.I liked this device and again it is personal preference. I have made an effort to highlight the device's pros and cons which could help a prospective buyer."
2980,4.0,"Was never a fan of Samsung mobiles, but this phone caught my attention from past 2 years. I preferred this over the latest samsung devices mainly bcoz of Snapdragon.
Almost all the things looks pretty decent. Battery life is around 1.5 days on my medium usage. One thing I really don't like about this phone is the biometrics, be it fingerprint reader or the face ID, they are very slow and most of the time fails to recognize me and have to take 2-3 tries, it's very frustrating."
2981,4.0,"This model is packed with bundles of features with grate photo and video quality. A true flagship experience within price range of 27K or 30K is admirable. However, need more improvement on battery life as i do observed notable reduction within usage of just 1 month. Hope Samsung will provide one UI 5 updates and android 13 upgradation for S20FE5G. This phone is really stand out from crowd."
2982,4.0,"This smartphone is working good overall and is value for money. I required to replace the display of this smartphone after just 1 month of purchase so, that is a negative."
2983,5.0,i think this product was refurbished because that time when i was open the box mobile seen not covered with safety cover and box like seen already open and repacked.
2984,4.0,"Well, I have been using this product for 30 days and then I an writing this review.

● Camera: a excellent camera quality..I have attached some of my clicks..night mode , hdr modes are superb. 30x zoom is good....not as like s21/s22 ultra..but moon photos looks nice .videos in 4k are super stable and have a great details.

● Battery: Battery is not the highlight...4500mah battery is quiet less for a regular user..and most disappointing part is 15wt charging ...2hrs to fully charged.you have to buy 25wt charger .

● Display: A great Display...shows awesome colours..brightness is not as flagships but I didn't face as visibility issue in direct sunlight. Support 4k HDR in youtube. 120hz feels super smooth.

● performance: Not at all a performance centric phone...but for regular users sd865 just killer. In bgmi it supports (smooth-HD)+ extreme or HDR+ ultra..for casual gaming..it is also good...a lil bit heating while playing bgmi but didn't affect the performance. But you can definitely get a better performance centric phone in this price range .

●Features: Samsung dex, bixby voice assistant, bixby routine, samsung AI photo editor, secure folder, AOD, Game booster,wireless and reverse wireless charging,"
2985,4.0,"Bought this phone on October 2021. Writing the review exactly after 1 year's of usage.

Pros:
1. Screen. Do I even need to say this? Typical Samsung with excellent screen. The only thing is missing here is HDR 10+ for content streaming on YouTube and Netflix.
2. Sound. The stereo speakers are magnificent.
3. Cameras. Practical no-nonsence, no gimmick cameras. Excellent quality. This phone can easily go toe-to-toe with iPhone 12 and 13 (not the pro models). Geeks, you don't need Gcams for this phone, trust me.
4. Processor. Snapdragon 865 is still a highly capable processor. Completely in a different league than any latest SD 7 series processors. Also, Samsung India provides 9 5G bands with this phone, which is not available in 60k+ OnePlus and many other brand phones. So now when 5G has finally started rolling out in India, you are covered with this phone.
5. OneUI. With OxygenOS is officially just a variant of ColorOS now, OneUI is the best Android skin after the stock Android. It is fast, fluid and highly interactive with Bixby. Yes, Bixby has come a long way, and it has evolved significantly.

Cons:
1. Battery could have been better. I usually get screen on time of 4 to 4.5 hours. Although, I keep my phone on 120 Hz, Always on Display and with Battery Protector, for which I don't charge my phone above 85%.
2. Screen brightness is a significant issue. The peak brightness is not among the highest in this range (30k to 40k), and hence visibility under direct sunlight is a problem with this phone."
2986,4.0,"A much balanced phone. It's my first samsung phone. And i am quite surprised with the performance. Snapdragon 865 is really really good. It tackles all the day to day task very easily.
One thing I am surprised that it comes with Android 12 . Which is good but has buggs. I wish it had Android 11 only.
Camera department is quite impressive. I recommend you to install Gcam. It will help you to utilize the camera fully.
Battery- a person like me who is a light user . Easily the battery last one day. If you are a rough user. U might need a powerbank🤭.
And one more thing battery is 4300 mah. Surprised? U should be. Samsung lied to its user😂"
2987,4.0,"This is totally my personal opinion about the phone, there are too many aspects to talk about and it will definitely help you with your buying...

1. Look and build: (8 out of 10) Firstly it is a good-looking phone for me, simple and sober, with a metallic frame the phone feels good on the hands too, back made of plastic and not too prone to scratches, even I dropped it a couple of times but it is fine as of now. So the plastic build is a key for those who don't use covers. but you must regret not having a 3.5mm jack.

2. DIsplay: (7 out of 10) To be honest display is good but not as good as other Samsung flagship, I was using it along with the Samsung S9 and Realme X2pro side by side on 1080p resolution but the s9 and X2pro look more sharp and bright as compared, Pixel density and brightness nits are satisfactory but not issue in outdoors. overall the display looks good.

3. Performace:(7 out of 10) It is the key part for me, with regular day-to-day tasks, multitasking app switching everything is fine unless it comes to gaming. the device comes with SD865 and on paper, it is a very good SOC for performance and for gaming also, but Samsung doing it very wrong in the part of gaming, I m daily driver Bgmi player and I play it a lot, in the term of gaming performance it works really poor as compared to my Realme X2pro with SD 855plus. with the smooth extreme setting, there are high Visible frame drops and stutters. frames drop as low as 40-35 fps as compared to X2pro which continues to maintain 55-60 fps. Samsung does not work well on gaming optimization. So as my view who looks for a good gaming phone go for Realme Oneplus or other but if gaming is not that matter then definitely go for this.

4. Camera:(9 out of 10) It is another key point for me, the camera performance on this phone looks excellent, I am fond of photography and for me, the camera works really well on color balance dynamic range, etc. wide-angle camera and portrait mode is excellent and the sensor works really good on low light conditions. the primary sensor OIS works really well but Video mode with the wide-angle lens is missing. Samsung must add it with updates. Overall the camera is really good.

5. Battery: (8 out of 10)4500 mah is kind of enough for a mid-user. it typically lasts for a day most of the time. Battery management and optimization are good. But for the heavy users with heavy app load and background load the phone needs to charge more than one time a day.

6. multimedia:(9 out of 10) Videos and movie watching experience is fun on this as the volume is loud and the Dolby sound and stereo effect works really well.

7.UI:(8 out of 10) Samsung One UI looks clean and good but comes with lots of preinstalled bloatware ( some of them are uninstallable ) and adds( can be disabled while device setup or from the settings) and Android 11 and Samsung Nox security is a key part of this phone as the device comes with hardware base extra layer of security. and Samsung is good at pushing regular security updates and 3 years platform update. and it makes the device future-proof.

8. Network reception:(9 out of 10) I am using airtel as primary sim. there is not carrier aggregation in my area. but devices support it also it supports Vowifi and dual-band WIFI so no issue with the network reception.

I brought it for 41k with an extra 7k discount. and it kind of value of money for me because of the Brand name. and it is a really good phone from Samsung. but in this price segment, and there are lots of other options to look for."
2988,4.0,Good phone but if you keep refresh rate 120 the phone barely lasts a whole day but if you set it on 60 hertz the phone can last upto 2 days with 7 hours screen on time
2989,4.0,Mobile is good but the time taken to deliver was too much.

2991,4.0,"Simply awesome. It's samsung S - Supreme series, wireless charging with reverse charging, ip68, flagship cameras, amazing processor, good finger print reader, 120hz refresh rate. All for 30k is a steal deal. Only worry is battery life. Lasts a whole day in moderate to slight heavy usage. Overall v good buy"
2992,4.0,"Phone is perfect..with crisp display, good sound n decent battery life.
U will miss 3.5mm jack in it
Battery last one day so need to keep charger with u if away from home for long period.
Easy to hold in hand
Finger print sensor words fast n emit white light which look good.
Overall happy with the phone as itvrunning OS12 which is charm to use.
Lets see how it perform in long run as my last phone Oppo F9pro lasted approx 4.5 years..."
2993,4.0,"I liked camera the most. I bought this phone at 24k during sale and I would say it fullfills all my requirements. Although battery backup could have been better but with 4500 mAh, you cannot expect more. Another lag is touchscreen fingerprint sensor. It takes about a second while unlocking while other phones take less than half second, but overall it is managable. Rest of the features are great, specially the camera. It generates best quality photos and videos. You can definitely purchase this phone but only when it costs less than 25k. If you want to spend more than 25k, I would recommend to go for other brands with better battery backup and more powerful camera quality."
2994,4.0,Very poor in gaming experience otherwise great quality.
2995,4.0,Nice phone but battery backup is not good.
2996,4.0,"Overall experience after using one is good.
Little improvement required in fingerprint sensor, battery life.
Otherwise phone is good 👍"

2999,4.0,"Everything is good except battery backup. Always we have to put in power saving mode and many setting in backend for one day to work. Charging taking 1.5hrs for 100% from 5٪. Camera in day time and lighting it's excellent, but low lighting and in nights it's not that much good. Only above two are issues."

Cons- limited Android updates , battery, headphone jack."
3010,4.0,"I will really recommend you this phone if you want to experience how a flagship phone experience.
Some points to remember-
Don't buy for gaming purpose it will give you a little good gaming performance like 40 to 50 fps fixed in bgmi and multi-player games also it also heat up so much because the chip used in it doesn't have inbuilt network modem or something which they have added separately as a chipset which always makes your phone heat up also increase battery consumption.
Reasons to buy-
Flagship experience
Bixby voice assistant can do things like
-Taking screenshot
-Call anyone without touching phone
-Taking photos by voice commands
-play any music
-open/close any app
Smooth 120 ghz amoled display
Clean one ui
Night cameras 🤯
And 30x zoom on camera
Better stabilization while recording video
4k 60 fps available on both side
Reverse wireless charging can charge your ear buds on the way if going on long trips.
After all in last I will say a perfect balanced phone for a normal user will satisfy all needs and normal user. And if you want gaming phone go for iPhone or or other Chinese midrangers. Overall conclusion buy it in 2022 if you can get it under 30k to 35k
I got it for 25k in sale and I still can't believe myself what a phone this is."
3011,4.0,"Nice experience, camera is awesome, battery life is shorter, normal use for one day"
3012,4.0,"Like : phone design, speaker, display clarity
Dislike: nothing"
3013,4.0,"I purchased one Chinese mobile 6 months back and i didnt like it. So i sold it for loss. I didn't want to purshase any mobile that costs more than 30 k. So i came across this mobile. Bought it for 25 k during great Indian festival. I think it's a great deal. Ver few people might got it at this lowest price I'm happy that I'm one among them. I literally fell in love with this mobile.
Pros
Superb display
Awsome camera (rear) performance during day light conditions
IP 68 rating
Stereo speakers
One UI is simple.
SD 865 procesessor at its best
Reverse charging
Wireless charging

Cons.
Average front camera but it's still good.
Average battery if you are a moderate user it will last for day.
only 25 watt charging support.

Note: you will get 18 watt charger Android 13 might be the last software update for this phone. Security updates will be available till 2024.

If you get it below 30 k just go for it. You will never regret your deicision."
3014,4.0,Battery life very low
3015,4.0,Good 👍
3016,4.0,"The battery on this one is a disaster. On several occasions, I had to charge it twice a day and have to always carry a 10000 mah power bank with me whenever I go out. Rest everything is great - camera, processor, etc. The night mode is super awesome; beats iPhone’s night mode hands down."
3017,4.0,Good one
3018,4.0,Changing slow
3019,4.0,"It's been 15 days since i using the device extensively.
I bought it on the Last freedom sale for Rs. 41,999 ( including 6k instant discount coupon).
First let me be clear , I bought ' S20 FE 5G 'with Snapdragon 865 , not ' S20 FE with Exynos ' and i am a user who uses phone most of the time .
This review may be long but it's worth to read it if you're buying this product.
Let me divide between the Pros and Cons.
First i would like like to start with Pros of the Device ,
Pros :
1. Display :
Samsung has been already popular for it's AMOLED Displays but i saw some of the reviewers wrote about some display issues here . They might have got some defective Piece. I have no issues with my display . It's been long time i saw a great display like this ... with 120Hz it is Super Smooth.
Also , it is very bright on outdoors and can decrease it to very low while using at low light conditions ( PS : No tint issues )
The in display finger print scanner is very fast and didn't faced any issues with it .

2. Stereo Speakers :
As an extensive multimedia user , this is one of the most favorable feature for me.
Believe me , you can't find any other device with such great Sound quality in this price segment , it's almost like flagship devices ..
Both the speakers are adequately loud.

3. Battery :
As a person who's shifting from a normal 60Hz Device phone , i was very worried about the battery life of this device at 120Hz but it surprised me very well ..
Initially i thought i would need to switch to 60Hz for better battery life for daily usage.
But I didn't even thought this device would give this much great battery life at 120Hz.
At 120Hz , I am getting around 7 hours of minimum SOT ( Screen on Time ).
The maximum SOT i got at 120Hz is 9Hours 13 minutes.
I didn't checked battery life at 60Hz because i didn't use it at 60Hz even a single day . The battery life is Excellent.

4. Rear Cameras :
I am not a very good photographer or something , i am just an ordinary person who use camera occasionally.
I was very excited to use the telephoto lens which only can be found on flagship devices and it performs very well..
Added Some Camera Samples above ( Pic 1 : Ultrawide , Pic 2 : Telephoto [ Pic may not be clear as it was when taken due to compression of the image while uploading )
Both the three Cameras ( Primary + Ultrawide + Telephoto ) performs very well.
If you're a camera guy you should definitely check this out.

5. Performance & RAM Management :
I'm not a gamer , I use my device for daily usage of social media , ott platforms , Calls , messages etc. but i use it extremely.
I didn't faced any kind of heating issues with the device until now.
Also ,Ram management of the Device is excellent , I am a person who uses 4-5 apps
background at single time and i didn't have any issues of closing down the apps .

6. ONE UI :
I was a stock Android guy , but One UI actually surprised me , it is very well optimised and very user-friendly for single hand usage..
initial days i found it little hard to use the stock menu of one Ui but I'm now got used to it.
PS : I didn't found any kind of ads on my device as i didn't sign up or used any samsung Apps.

7. Build Quality :
Even though its back is made up of plastic , the overall build quality is super Premium the Aluminium frame gives us a feel like using a flagship device..

8. Future Proof :
The device has 9 5G Bands , IP68 Rating , Wireless Charging which are very hard to find on any device in this price bracket.
IP68 & Wireless Charging are mostly only found on Flagship Devices . Its good to see samsung brings it at lower price.
This is the best future proof device as of now.

So these are the Major pros i noticed as of now .
Now let's move to the Cons.

Cons :
1. NO HDR SUPPORT ON NETFLIX :
As an extensive multimedia user , i found it very frustrating. even mid range devices offering HDR support on Netflix , Samsungs Flagship Killer doesn't have HDR support.
IT WILL NOT BE FIXED VIA OTA UPDATE .

2. No 256GB Variant :
This is actually not a problem for most of the people but as a power user who uses Dual sim , i found it little difficult.
But if you're a single sim user , luckily it have hybrid solution ..
so you can use a Sim card + expandable memory card ...

3. Gorilla Glass 3 :
Other competitors are providing atleast GG5 in this price range. But S20 FE 5G has just GG3 ( Which also I'm not sure as it is not mentioned officially anywhere ).
But at the end of the day , GLASS IS GLASS & IT WILL BROKE.

4. No headphone Jack :
It is not any kind of unusual thing .
most of the phones above 30K segment doesn't have headphone jack.
So we have to buy 3.5mm to Type C adapter , type c earphones or bluetooth solutions .
Note : Only Buy original Samsung type c adapter else it may not support.

5. No 25W charger :
It is not actually a con for me as i prefer Low watt charger which is good for battery health and beneficial for long term usage .
but it may be a con for you ,
Although the device supports 25W charging . Only 15W charger is provided inside the box .. They should have given 25W inside the box.
I didn't have any issues with 15W charger but it would be great if they bundle it with 25W as competitors are way ahead in terms of charging speed.
For the reference of Charging speed ,
Both 15W & 25W will full charge the device almost at the same time but using 25W you can get about 50% within 30 minutes where as 30% with 15W charger.
Full charge time i usually takes is 1hour and 35 minutes.

6. Front Camera :
I am not a selfie guy , but if you're a person who's looking for a selfie device just don't buy it . it's not like the front camera quality is really bad or anything but it's not even near to the rear camera quality and you can find better selfie smartphones in this price range

CONCLUSION :
If you're a person who wants a device for normal day to day usage with good battery life , great rear cameras , great performance , better software support , better build quality and use it for more than 3 years & the cons mentioned above doesn't bother you
Just buy it , I am sure you won't be disappointed."
3020,4.0,"It's been about 15 days since I got this phone. I got it for 29990 on prime day sale. For the price it's good.
Pros :
1. Camera. Coming from Poco X2, the camera quality on this is amazing according to the price. It gives you good colours, contrast, focus, and everything that you want. It has OIS which is very apparent while recording. At 4k60 the stability is worse. But set it to 1080p60 and the videos will be amazingly stable. And the main advantage of OIS other than stable video is GREAT night mode shots. Hold the phone stable for a while and along with OIS you will get great photos with accurate colors and nice exposure. Attached samples.

2. Display : Absolutely best. Samsung displays are the best. 120hz FHD. Flows smoothly. Colors and calibration is top notch. Brightness is good but I felt it's a little insufficient under direct sunlight. It's visible but could be better.
3. OneUI : The main reason for upgrading to this phone was software. OneUI4.0 is the absolute best android skin right now. It has way too many customisations in it and let's you personalise your phone to a very high degree. Like there's a feature to read out the name of the person who's calling if your wearing headphones. It took me 3 days to fully go through all the settings and change them to my needs. Also Knoxx security is a special mention. Knoxx security is a software and hardware feature in samsung phones which protects your phone from all kinds of attacks and keeps your data safe. Even if it gets stolen you can remotely delete all your data. Secure folder allows you to store data in a separate storage. And many more such good features. While being a very feature rich and storage heavy skin, it still feels very very smooth and fast to use. Unlike MIUI or other skins, it doesn't stutter much and bugs are less.
There are many other small pros like good stereo speakers. Nice premium build quality. Good data and wifi speeds. Other such features that you won't notice but definitely make a difference in your experience.

Cons
1. Software. I know I said it's a pro but I say this in the aspect of updates. This phone was launched in 2021 March in India and samsung promises 3 year android version updates and 1 additional year of security updates. But there's a lot of confusion regarding if or not this phone will receive Android 14. It will receive A13 for sure. There's a lot of debate on what they will do with14 because of global version launch date being earlier and yada yada. Basically the phones life maybe 2.5 to 3 years if they give a14. But 1.5 to 2 if not. I researched on the Internet a few people say that it will receive a14 while I was few say it's not. It's hard to say who's correct. So assume it's not getting a14 if you are going for it.
2. Battery. The battery on this phone is 4500mah and it's good enough for a days use. But that's because I use it lightly. Not much online streaming. No gaming light social media and other usual stuff. If you use it even a tad bit more heavily, you will run out within a day. If you're going outside for the better part of a day,like a day trip to somewhere nearby,it's better keep a power bank handy. In terms of Screen on time numbers, I once got 7 hours of sot on light usage, 1 hr YouTube and 1.5 hr streaming. I was at home and used wifi all the time.
I got 3 hrs sot when I went outside for a day trip. I took many photos and videos and the phone shutdown before I could reach home. On a mixed use day, you can get 4.5 to 5.5 hours of sot.

Final verdict : The life of the phone in terms of Software Support is not great but you will get on time updates and almost no bugs in the software. So if you want to buy it you can and exchange it after maybe 2 years for other models. But if you planning on using it for longer than 2 years, better avoid it. In the upcoming diwali and dussera sales, the price might further drop to 25k even. I am just speculating but keep in mind your requirements and go accordingly.
As always amazing delivery by Amazon."
3021,4.0,"To begin with, I had to return the initial product delivered to me. It had minor bumps on the left side of the screen in the (edgy) place where the screen is fitted to the body but had no other problems with it functionally. I made a complaint call to amazon and got my replacement the same day itself. I have been using the replacement for a week now.

Overall cost was around 31k INR via coupons & Amazon Summer Sale'22.

First and foremost, I had made a conscious decision to replace this phone by the end of they year even before I clicked the purchase button because I somehow felt that I was very late to buy it (was released in 2020; and the 2022 variant is not available in India so far). But the handset is impressive and those of you looking for a future proof phone, this product will definitely be viable for another couple of years at the least if not more.

Its a bit lengthy and definitely is chunkier than most phones I have handled (which is actually not that many; definitely no flagships or ultras) but the weight is nicely distributed and is very comfortable to hold. However, the finish both front and back despite looking so elegant are prone to be muddled by finger prints (I constantly wipe the screen and back with a micro fiber cloth just to admire it in its pristine form ;p).

Display is extra-ordinary (120 Hz by default). Perhaps it is the USP of this product and Samsung screens are anyway the golden standard in this part of the globe at least. Smooth screen transitions, buttery responsive to touch (can be adjusted). Overall display and screen are flagship-grade. I am very careful with most of my electronics so the gorilla glass 3 (I have seen some reviews where people have dropped this phone and completely lost their screen - usually through shattering) does not really bother me and there is no direct impact on resolution or touch as far as I am concerned.

The snapdragon 865 compliments the screen and display with good handling of most common applications, the phone OS and the manufacturer specific features. I have never had any stutter or slowness so far but then it has only been a week and I will update this section after a few months of usage. There was noticeable heating while setting up the phone and never after that

I am in no means a power user (but the SD865 is making me feel like one :p). I consume high amounts of streaming media, moderate time with messenger & email apps and the occasional games and I can say that my phone sees moderate to less screen-on time on a regular day. The battery is fit enough and more to handle these requirements and the 8GB RAM is sufficient. I plan to do some stress tests on the battery and RAM; will add the outcomes in the next update to this review. The charging is also fast (via the in box 15W adapter) and I have not plugged in my phone more than once in 48 hrs (for a full charge-discharge cycle: 100% to 10%).

The cameras for which I had no expectations because I am not a big user of them seem to be a very big step up from my Nokia 6.1. Good colors when there is sufficient lighting around, good quality of zoomed in/out pics; adequate for a user like me and from the reviews I have heard of the phone they can be punchy enough to produce some magical shots in the hands of a knowledgeable user.

Audio is excellent; could not expect more. Strong but filtered output from the receiver even if I keep the phone around my ears instead of pressing them against the ears. The bottom speaker is also sturdy and it pairs well with the receiver to produce a fluent stereo experience. I have already moved on from the 3.5mm jack; I am using the Samsung buds pro and loving it.

So as you may have observed, I have just graduated to a no-compromise midship segment of smartphones and my next handset will definitely be a pure flagship. The S20 FE has in its first week, made a great impression and I do not see myself going back to budget or mid range phones from here (that in my opinion is a good impact for a fan edition handset).

People, this is a very underrated phone (S21 FE seems like an unimpressive hollywood sequel to the S20 FE as per my understanding). Go for this phone - it is a blessing at the 30-40k range for users like me who are looking to move up towards the flagship experience."
3022,4.0,"Battery charging speed is the only negative point , it takes one hour 40 mins for 0 to 100% with the 15w adapter they provided in the box , display is average not that much vibrant samsung display is always good but not this one , in outdoor the display brightness is not upto the level , camera quality is top notch , design is so good , i didn't expected that much for the design, but really impressed for the design in hand feel is very good, I satisfied with the Mobile except the display and the battery"
3023,4.0,"Purchased samsung S20 FE for my brother, totally happy with the festive price and Samsung never disappoints the purchase
Only thing that would have been good was battery capacity, fact that fast charging was supported, but the charger could have been type C to type C. Where as USB to type C was given this phone which is sad. Love the camera quality as it gives best shots with primary sensors and amazing selfie cam."
3024,4.0,"Pros:-
#Cameras in videos and photos both
#Display Amoled 👌
#Sterieo Speakers Dual mics while recording
#lag free Perfomance
#One Ui some features like objecteraser, inbuilt video editor, gallery organizer,remaster s22 ultra feature etc
#wireless & Reverse wireless charging and ip68 Bonus
Price is big 👍 Got it for 27k during Diwali sale 30k is also better price for this device

Small Cons:-
#Charging Speed it takes 1.5 hour from 15% to 100%
#battery backup heavy use 5hours
Normal use YouTube insta etc igets 6 to7hours
#Fingerprint hit or miss sometimes
#Front camera for photos not that great for videos ok 4k 60fps
#Outdoor sunlight visibility was ok"
3025,4.0,"Cons
1. U can't have a 'guest account/second space' (realme /mi have it to use all second app like KITE to install)
2. Cant use 2nd sim or memory card together
3. Camera is good but AI beautification (for selfie etc) is not there. U hav to edit if u need those as it clicks original. Girls did not like selfie cam.

Pros
Rest all(battery, display, ui) good."
3026,4.0,"Pro.
Camera- Rear camera are one among the best performing in the market
Performance- Flagship level
UI-less bloatwares
Con
Battery getting drained very fastly.
they could have given a 45w charging instead of 25 and inside 15w charger.
Display with less brightness.
Heating if you are using mobile data even if there no activities hence they had given a separate 5G modem inside.
If you are using wifi data there is no heating.

Verdict
Purchase this if you need a camera phone with best performance and less battery backup"
3027,4.0,"pros-
1) CAMERAS- almost flagship level quality, no nonsensical cameras, almost all flagship features, manageable cutout
2) DESIGN- it's simple matt finish design; not clumsy and shining like most phones now a days
3) FEATURES- almost all flagship level features incl. IP 68, wireless charging, etc.
4) CUSTOMIZATION- insane level of customisation any phone can do. it'll take weeks to try all CUSTOMIZATION features for normal users
5) light weight
6) SPEED- earlier samsung used to be slow but now a days ONE UI has changed the picture, especially this one is SD 865; no heating issues as such for average users.
plus 120 hz display with S-AMOLED feels so fast and smooth like butter
7) most of the bloatwares can be deleted
8) SOUND- enough for day to day task+ dolby atmos feels so awesome bcs of stereo speakers
9) SOFT. UPDATES- almost each month. samsung has now become the king in software update
10) 5G- it's 5g ready with enough band unlike most phones with 1-2 bands.

CONS-
1) battery back-up- average( though can be managed throughout the day for average users)
2) average battery back-up coupled with average charging speed
3) night mode isn't working after the update
4) the chin is noticeable

CONCLUSION-
plastic back( though very good quality and seems glass), little bezels, etc is understandable for me as this is almost flagship level phone with mid range level price tag. i got it @below 30k+ card disc. which is such a respectable price tag for this phone. no other phone(even 2022 released phone) can stand a chance in this price range.
believe me if you're no frills, logical person who understands the real use of a smartphone, this phone is for you.
otherwise, there're phones with 5-6 cameras and 8 inch displays with 7k power batteries with no actual use and average quality like oneplus now a days.
also, i ignored s21 fe bcs of EXYNOS and design.

Enjoy the precious life.

edit- night mode issue solved after update"
3028,4.0,It is a wonderful mobile mainly in camera performance was very impressively and i am big fan of Samsung mobiles that's why i bought this mobile and i am fully satisfied but there is some cons also there like battery was drained early and charge mobile twice a day and fingerprint was slowly however overall product was very good and reasonable to buy
3029,4.0,"Writing this review after 3 months of usage.
Will divide this review into pros and cons.

First, the Pros:
1.Software and One UI-Many people complain that One UI is bloated and it's bad compared to stock android or other brands.This is not the case, It comes with a lot of useful features like improved security (knox) and app management. There are no ADS apart from a couple of apps like weather which can be disabled, Also, ads will be disabled in future updates. Samsung also is excellent in providing software and security updates,with 3years software support.So you won't feel let down on the software experience.
2.Performance-Snapdragon 865 is Snappy and efficient, no lags whatsoever Can handle heavy applications and games thanks to 8 GB RAM, improved thermal and battery performance compared to exynos variant.Lot of people complaining about Samsung phones heating up, There is a difference between getting warm and heating up. This device never heats up and getting warm is normal on any smartphone. this is not the case only with Samsung but I have used phones from other brands and they too get warm after using it for an hour or so continuously.
. I'm not a samsung fan but criticizing a product without proper research can prevent prospective users from buying good products.
3.Network Connectivity: Have used the phone while traveling and did not experience network drops, Radio reception is very good and call experience was great.
4.Camera: This device comes with good set of cameras (triple camera)and takes great pictures, Samsung's camera optimization is good compared to competition at this price point.
5.Sound and Media experience: Excellent sound output thanks to dual stereo speakers, watching media even without a headset is a great experience. Comes with dolby atmos support. Amazing experience with galaxy buds 2 which you can buy separately.
6.Display-Samoled Display is amazing. Supports upto 120hz refresh rate which makes things buttery smooth.The color reproduction is excellent and samsung makes displays for other renowned brands.Supports HDR videos, tested on YouTube but doesn't work on Netflix because Netflix has to certify the device and not a problem with the device. Overall, media consumption has been a great experience.
7.Great build quality: The phone can survive a few drops. Front is corning gorilla glass 3 back is premium plastic with metal frame. The phone is also IP68 certified for dust and water resistance.
8.Battery: This is not exactly a pro but included in the pro section because there are a lot of people criticizing battery life. The battery performance is neither a pro nor a con, similar to other devices available at this price point.The device has a 4500 MAH battery and easily lasts a day and half with heavy to moderate use and standby will last even longer, I charge the phone once a day, which is similar to all the smartphones in this price range. You can easily expect a screen on time of 7 to 8 hours which not really something that deserves criticizing.
9.5G ready with 9 5g bands.

Cons:
1. Only 15 watt charger included in the box by samsung which takes atleast 1.5 hours to charge the phone. Could have been better with atleast a 25 watt charger in the box. When competitors are providing 30+ watt chargers in this price range.
2.Fingerprint scanner: comes with an in display fingerprint sensor which works well most of the time but it is clumsy at times.
3.Average front camera.

Verdict: value for money smartphone at this pricepoint. A good smartphone investment for the next couple or 3 years.I liked this device and again it is personal preference. I have made an effort to highlight the device's pros and cons which could help a prospective buyer."
3030,4.0,"Was never a fan of Samsung mobiles, but this phone caught my attention from past 2 years. I preferred this over the latest samsung devices mainly bcoz of Snapdragon.
Almost all the things looks pretty decent. Battery life is around 1.5 days on my medium usage. One thing I really don't like about this phone is the biometrics, be it fingerprint reader or the face ID, they are very slow and most of the time fails to recognize me and have to take 2-3 tries, it's very frustrating."
3031,4.0,"This model is packed with bundles of features with grate photo and video quality. A true flagship experience within price range of 27K or 30K is admirable. However, need more improvement on battery life as i do observed notable reduction within usage of just 1 month. Hope Samsung will provide one UI 5 updates and android 13 upgradation for S20FE5G. This phone is really stand out from crowd."
3032,4.0,"This smartphone is working good overall and is value for money. I required to replace the display of this smartphone after just 1 month of purchase so, that is a negative."
3033,4.0,i think this product was refurbished because that time when i was open the box mobile seen not covered with safety cover and box like seen already open and repacked.
3034,4.0,"Well, I have been using this product for 30 days and then I an writing this review.

● Camera: a excellent camera quality..I have attached some of my clicks..night mode , hdr modes are superb. 30x zoom is good....not as like s21/s22 ultra..but moon photos looks nice .videos in 4k are super stable and have a great details.

● Battery: Battery is not the highlight...4500mah battery is quiet less for a regular user..and most disappointing part is 15wt charging ...2hrs to fully charged.you have to buy 25wt charger .

● Display: A great Display...shows awesome colours..brightness is not as flagships but I didn't face as visibility issue in direct sunlight. Support 4k HDR in youtube. 120hz feels super smooth.

● performance: Not at all a performance centric phone...but for regular users sd865 just killer. In bgmi it supports (smooth-HD)+ extreme or HDR+ ultra..for casual gaming..it is also good...a lil bit heating while playing bgmi but didn't affect the performance. But you can definitely get a better performance centric phone in this price range .

●Features: Samsung dex, bixby voice assistant, bixby routine, samsung AI photo editor, secure folder, AOD, Game booster,wireless and reverse wireless charging,"
3035,4.0,"Bought this phone on October 2021. Writing the review exactly after 1 year's of usage.

Pros:
1. Screen. Do I even need to say this? Typical Samsung with excellent screen. The only thing is missing here is HDR 10+ for content streaming on YouTube and Netflix.
2. Sound. The stereo speakers are magnificent.
3. Cameras. Practical no-nonsence, no gimmick cameras. Excellent quality. This phone can easily go toe-to-toe with iPhone 12 and 13 (not the pro models). Geeks, you don't need Gcams for this phone, trust me.
4. Processor. Snapdragon 865 is still a highly capable processor. Completely in a different league than any latest SD 7 series processors. Also, Samsung India provides 9 5G bands with this phone, which is not available in 60k+ OnePlus and many other brand phones. So now when 5G has finally started rolling out in India, you are covered with this phone.
5. OneUI. With OxygenOS is officially just a variant of ColorOS now, OneUI is the best Android skin after the stock Android. It is fast, fluid and highly interactive with Bixby. Yes, Bixby has come a long way, and it has evolved significantly.

Cons:
1. Battery could have been better. I usually get screen on time of 4 to 4.5 hours. Although, I keep my phone on 120 Hz, Always on Display and with Battery Protector, for which I don't charge my phone above 85%.
2. Screen brightness is a significant issue. The peak brightness is not among the highest in this range (30k to 40k), and hence visibility under direct sunlight is a problem with this phone."
3036,4.0,"A much balanced phone. It's my first samsung phone. And i am quite surprised with the performance. Snapdragon 865 is really really good. It tackles all the day to day task very easily.
One thing I am surprised that it comes with Android 12 . Which is good but has buggs. I wish it had Android 11 only.
Camera department is quite impressive. I recommend you to install Gcam. It will help you to utilize the camera fully.
Battery- a person like me who is a light user . Easily the battery last one day. If you are a rough user. U might need a powerbank🤭.
And one more thing battery is 4300 mah. Surprised? U should be. Samsung lied to its user😂"
3037,4.0,"This is totally my personal opinion about the phone, there are too many aspects to talk about and it will definitely help you with your buying...

1. Look and build: (8 out of 10) Firstly it is a good-looking phone for me, simple and sober, with a metallic frame the phone feels good on the hands too, back made of plastic and not too prone to scratches, even I dropped it a couple of times but it is fine as of now. So the plastic build is a key for those who don't use covers. but you must regret not having a 3.5mm jack.

2. DIsplay: (7 out of 10) To be honest display is good but not as good as other Samsung flagship, I was using it along with the Samsung S9 and Realme X2pro side by side on 1080p resolution but the s9 and X2pro look more sharp and bright as compared, Pixel density and brightness nits are satisfactory but not issue in outdoors. overall the display looks good.

3. Performace:(7 out of 10) It is the key part for me, with regular day-to-day tasks, multitasking app switching everything is fine unless it comes to gaming. the device comes with SD865 and on paper, it is a very good SOC for performance and for gaming also, but Samsung doing it very wrong in the part of gaming, I m daily driver Bgmi player and I play it a lot, in the term of gaming performance it works really poor as compared to my Realme X2pro with SD 855plus. with the smooth extreme setting, there are high Visible frame drops and stutters. frames drop as low as 40-35 fps as compared to X2pro which continues to maintain 55-60 fps. Samsung does not work well on gaming optimization. So as my view who looks for a good gaming phone go for Realme Oneplus or other but if gaming is not that matter then definitely go for this.

4. Camera:(9 out of 10) It is another key point for me, the camera performance on this phone looks excellent, I am fond of photography and for me, the camera works really well on color balance dynamic range, etc. wide-angle camera and portrait mode is excellent and the sensor works really good on low light conditions. the primary sensor OIS works really well but Video mode with the wide-angle lens is missing. Samsung must add it with updates. Overall the camera is really good.

5. Battery: (8 out of 10)4500 mah is kind of enough for a mid-user. it typically lasts for a day most of the time. Battery management and optimization are good. But for the heavy users with heavy app load and background load the phone needs to charge more than one time a day.

6. multimedia:(9 out of 10) Videos and movie watching experience is fun on this as the volume is loud and the Dolby sound and stereo effect works really well.

7.UI:(8 out of 10) Samsung One UI looks clean and good but comes with lots of preinstalled bloatware ( some of them are uninstallable ) and adds( can be disabled while device setup or from the settings) and Android 11 and Samsung Nox security is a key part of this phone as the device comes with hardware base extra layer of security. and Samsung is good at pushing regular security updates and 3 years platform update. and it makes the device future-proof.

8. Network reception:(9 out of 10) I am using airtel as primary sim. there is not carrier aggregation in my area. but devices support it also it supports Vowifi and dual-band WIFI so no issue with the network reception.

I brought it for 41k with an extra 7k discount. and it kind of value of money for me because of the Brand name. and it is a really good phone from Samsung. but in this price segment, and there are lots of other options to look for."
3038,4.0,Good phone but if you keep refresh rate 120 the phone barely lasts a whole day but if you set it on 60 hertz the phone can last upto 2 days with 7 hours screen on time
3039,4.0,Mobile is good but the time taken to deliver was too much.

3041,4.0,"Simply awesome. It's samsung S - Supreme series, wireless charging with reverse charging, ip68, flagship cameras, amazing processor, good finger print reader, 120hz refresh rate. All for 30k is a steal deal. Only worry is battery life. Lasts a whole day in moderate to slight heavy usage. Overall v good buy"

Overall happy with the phone as itvrunning OS12 which is charm to use.
Lets see how it perform in long run as my last phone Oppo F9pro lasted approx 4.5 years..."
3043,4.0,"I liked camera the most. I bought this phone at 24k during sale and I would say it fullfills all my requirements. Although battery backup could have been better but with 4500 mAh, you cannot expect more. Another lag is touchscreen fingerprint sensor. It takes about a second while unlocking while other phones take less than half second, but overall it is managable. Rest of the features are great, specially the camera. It generates best quality photos and videos. You can definitely purchase this phone but only when it costs less than 25k. If you want to spend more than 25k, I would recommend to go for other brands with better battery backup and more powerful camera quality."

3059,4.0,"PROS - Display , smooth UI , KNOX SECURITY.
Cons- limited Android updates , battery, headphone jack."
3060,4.0,"I will really recommend you this phone if you want to experience how a flagship phone experience.
Some points to remember-
Don't buy for gaming purpose it will give you a little good gaming performance like 40 to 50 fps fixed in bgmi and multi-player games also it also heat up so much because the chip used in it doesn't have inbuilt network modem or something which they have added separately as a chipset which always makes your phone heat up also increase battery consumption.
Reasons to buy-
Flagship experience
Bixby voice assistant can do things like
-Taking screenshot
-Call anyone without touching phone
-Taking photos by voice commands
-play any music
-open/close any app
Smooth 120 ghz amoled display
Clean one ui
Night cameras 🤯
And 30x zoom on camera
Better stabilization while recording video
4k 60 fps available on both side
Reverse wireless charging can charge your ear buds on the way if going on long trips.
After all in last I will say a perfect balanced phone for a normal user will satisfy all needs and normal user. And if you want gaming phone go for iPhone or or other Chinese midrangers. Overall conclusion buy it in 2022 if you can get it under 30k to 35k
I got it for 25k in sale and I still can't believe myself what a phone this is."
3061,4.0,"Nice experience, camera is awesome, battery life is shorter, normal use for one day"
3062,4.0,"Like : phone design, speaker, display clarity
Dislike: nothing"
3063,4.0,"I purchased one Chinese mobile 6 months back and i didnt like it. So i sold it for loss. I didn't want to purshase any mobile that costs more than 30 k. So i came across this mobile. Bought it for 25 k during great Indian festival. I think it's a great deal. Ver few people might got it at this lowest price I'm happy that I'm one among them. I literally fell in love with this mobile.
Pros
Superb display
Awsome camera (rear) performance during day light conditions
IP 68 rating
Stereo speakers
One UI is simple.
SD 865 procesessor at its best
Reverse charging
Wireless charging

Cons.
Average front camera but it's still good.
Average battery if you are a moderate user it will last for day.
only 25 watt charging support.

Note: you will get 18 watt charger Android 13 might be the last software update for this phone. Security updates will be available till 2024.

If you get it below 30 k just go for it. You will never regret your deicision."

3066,4.0,"The battery on this one is a disaster. On several occasions, I had to charge it twice a day and have to always carry a 10000 mah power bank with me whenever I go out. Rest everything is great - camera, processor, etc. The night mode is super awesome; beats iPhone’s night mode hands down."

3069,4.0,"I am not big on camera usage, personally. I was even mentally prepared for a bad camera, based on some reviews here. But I was pleasantly surprised that camera clicks good photos. They are not awesome, but they are decent photos that can even be shared.
Now coming to my biggest grouse; heating issue. The phone started heating up while charging, but it was just a little and so I could have ignored it. But then it started heating up more and got me very concerned. I even ordered a replacement thinking I got a defective piece. But then, after further tests, I found that it is heating more when I download huge amounts of data, for example, when I restore data of my old phone, from back up. This is ok with me as, I don't perform huge data loads regularly, definitely not on phone. Then I tested by running tasks I usually perform such as checking office mails, attending office meeting on phone, watching a video from Amazon Prime, and so on. The phone did not heat up even a little. Personally, this is good for me.
At this price range, this is a good phone. But if you are camera heavy user and expect to perform heavy downloads frequently, this phone may not for you. I am personally satisfied with this phone as it works for my type of usage. I will not go into plus points of this phone as they are covered by other reviews already. I am only attempting to clarify about how this phone can suit you (or not) in terms of camera and heating. I had many questions about these aspects before buying. Perhaps this review will help you make an informed decision to buy (or avoid). Cheers."

3100,4.0,"I am writing this review after using the phone for a month. I got it for 8.5k during the Amazon Great Indian Festival and it's a great purchase for the price. I bought this phone after reading a lot of reviews and watching many videos and I must say that I am happy with my decision.
I was looking for a phone with 4 GB ram and 64 GB internal storage as storage space was the biggest drawback of my old phone. Also, I am not a very heavy user, so the battery works great for me. However, my biggest concern was lagging - as many reviews had mentioned that this phone has lagging issues. However, after using it for a week, my concerns were put to rest. The phone may lag once in a while, but the overall user experience is good. It's great for watching content, listening to podcasts and audiobooks, checking emails and performing other daily tasks. The camera quality is decent. What more can one expect at this price.
So overall, I am happy with the purchase. It's a good option for those who are looking for a budget phone and are not very heavy users."

3365,4.0,"-Phone runs amazing with the dimensity 810 and I only have praise for the performance
-90Hz refresh rate is eye opening coming from a 60hz phone
-Build is pretty solid and the back has a nice texture that doesnt build up fingerprints much
-Redmi has packed the phone with some neat features such as the IR blaster and the surprisingly amazing DAC which redmi didnt even flex about in the marketing. (my headphones sound miles better out of this phone than my laptop smh)
-Included phone cover is alright and its nice of redmi to throw one in (hole around headphone jack couldve been bigger though as it interferes with any aux cables with chonky housings.)

-Only complaints id have are that the design is kinda mid; doesnt look very amazing, but nothing to complain about either hmhm
-Cannot comment on camera quality as I am a pleb who doesnt know how to nitpick at camera quality :P
-Included screen protector is reaally bad( its only been under a month and there are already scratches around the lower screen where id be typing). So highly recommend peeling it off and taking your chances with the Gorilla Glass or just getting something aftermarket

3463,4.0,"Update - Aug 8th:-

Bought Xiaomi 12 Pro today which will be replacing my iQOO 9 Pro.. Got the 12 Pro for 50K!! after discounts.. As I compare the 12 Pro is slightly better than 9 Pro due to top notch hardware & QC in hardware.. Also MiUI clearly shows it's superiority straight away!.. My last post here n good luck to all the iQOO 9 Pro buyers.. As my last rating I still retain 4/5 for 9 Pro & there are certain features I'm going to miss for sure like say the superior selfie cam & worlds best fingerorint sensor for example.. But every phone has its advantage & disadvantage that way.. Bye..

Update - Aug 4th:-
The phone continues to be same as my March review. I get prompt monthly security update.. The phone is running July 2022 Android security update from past 15 days for example.. YouTube (my most used app) keeps crashing atleast 2 time everyday!.. the UI still lacks the polish/ aesthetics/ user friendliness of more refined Android UIs of the primary competition.. Funtouch OS has just not improved at all over months.. The cameras remain solid if not overly impressive.. The telephoto cam for example uses digital zooming until 10X!!.. Only after 10X Zoom the optical zoom takes effect n does well.. The selfie cam is still restricted to just 1080p 30fps video at max.. The main rear cam (Samsung GN5) & Ultrawide cam (Samsung JN1) are very good as always.. The speaker quality is impressive for everything other than YouTube app where the loudness is worst!.. The volume n sound quality is impressive otherwise in Spotify/ YouTube Music.. The haptics are decent but I believe it's behind the competition.. also Funtouch is worst in haptics implementation in the UI.. The screen quality is generally very good but the pre applied screen protector gets oily n dirty very easily.. The low brightness dark room view easily shows the screen bleeding in the lower half of the whole screen and since its a hardware issue, nothing much can be done.. The phone just overheats randomly during normal operation.. battery backup has been above average (I always use the phone in 1440p & 120hz combo only).. Antutu score could barely breach 8 lacs rarely.. mostly it is at around 7.5 lacs which is a big disappointment as that's not the score you expect out of a 8Gen1!.. It's more of a Snapdragon 870 level of performance.. Overall to say this phone is amongst the best options in the 50K to 70K range but the Xiaomi 12 Pro is possibly a slightly better phone overall due to better software experience.. Yet these phones are far better value than the overpriced Samsung S22 series.. I still retain 4/5 overall score for this phone..

Update - March 29th:-
Got 2 software updates. One came with March security update & the other said it is to resolve overheating issue on the phone. What it did was restrict the full performance of the phone to a mid ranger level!!.. Now the Antutu score can't even touch 7 lacs overall score and CPU is good for 1.63K!!.. Geekbench figures are like 900+ & 3100+!!.. The phone is able to perform any stress test app completely now!.. The maximum temperature is under control during stress test now (under 45 degrees).. All these benchmark performance apart, the phone is feeling sluggish n working very average in terms of speed & smoothness and this is always in 120hz mode!!.. The phone is overheating unwantedly now in regular use now!.. No difference in battery performance.. iQOO is really really poor in software optimization & experience and it shows!!.. They have just made a great performing phone a sluggish one that's it!!.. Adding on is fingerprint sensor becoming slow over time & even accuracy is reduced!!.. Still retaining 4 stars with a hope that they will do something to resolve all of these issues with an update soon..

Update - March 18th:-
Very happy with the phone performance overall.. Yes my phone does have screen bleeding issue under pitch dark conditions (brightness 20% n above).. Yes dual speaker loudness is Average n most of the times I have to keep the volume at near it's max in YouTube.. But other than these, I'm really happy with the super fast Snapdragon 8 Gen1 processor's performance.. Very good screen quality under normal usage.. Got used to FunTouch OS and now I'm starting to like the iQOO UI's feature rich n neatness.. have removed the unwanted apps easily using the adb function using my laptop.. The camera's front n back are top notch.. the lens' notify us to clean literally every time we shoot & therefore ensuring great pics.. very good battery life that enables a full day use easily.. the haptic motor seems decent now after setting it at the strongest level.. fingerprint sensor's combination of accuracy + security is the best on any smartphone in the world today!.. Overall the phone convinced me to sell my Samsung Note 20 Ultra and make the iQOO 9 Pro my primary phone now.. wish I could give a 4.5/ 5 at this point but don't want to give it a 5 due to aforementioned issues.. so will retain the score at 4 still..

Update - March 8th:-
I got the screen tint issue fixed by doing a factory reset. I found that it's a setting in developer options that needed to be turned off for the issue to be resolved. However still the screen lacks color calibration of a Samsung/ Apple panels still and inspite of being an E5 Amoled panel, still looks like a blue tinged 20K budget Realme Amoled screen!.. The default color settings and options don't help in this matter unfortunately.. The lower half of the phone screen has slight screen bleeding issue to add on!!..

The phones speaker loudness is strictly average shockingly!!.. GSMArena review of iQOO 9 Pro had Very Good rating for speaker loudness but Indian model has very average speaker loudness for media playback!.. surprisingly loudness isn't an issue for speaker calls where it is fine.. i have downloaded a Volume Booster 3rd party app to improve speaker loudness, so that is a workaround and what that also proves is the phone has the hardware to be loud but the stupid software isn't allowing it be fully capable!.. The haptic feedback of the phone is very average and is of my parents' Realme X7 Max/ Master Edition level!!.. The haptic feedback of our Samsung Note 20 Ultra & iPhone 12 are multiple times superior n it's nowhere close!..

The phone has a brilliant camera that goes toe to toe with the likes of top Samsung's & Apples.. Very happy with the cameras overall and that includes brilliant selfie snaps too.. The camera software is also very nice n better than other Android UIs..

UI n Software overall is lacking the features & finess of OneUI/ ColorOS/ MiUI.. hope that gets improved over time.. Google Chrome isn't even working on my phone at all!!.. some app crashes noticed already..

Great network coverage/ reception & call quality so far..

Snapdragon 8Gen1 is a monster n I got a mind-boggling score of 9.75 lacs overall score in Antutu with the CPU consistently scoring over 2 lacs no matter what.. Geekbench scores very also very good at over 1100 single core n 3500+ multi core.. The processor & phone do overheat unbearably while pushed to limits.. for example the phone could not run an Antutu stress test beyond 15 mins as the temperature crosses 45 degrees with ease.. but I'm hoping iQOO push some improvements in the future (I have seen Samsung improve their highly criticised Exynos 990 processor performance by leaps n bounds over time).. Overall very happy with having the best Android processor around..

Phone has brilliant looks but the supplied back cover is very slippery n lacks grip or comfort.. so have to buy a good one..

Fingerprint sensor is just awesome with its technology n the way it works in real life.. face unlock is unsafely fast n can recognise faces when you don't want it to also!!..

Battery life is very good and setting the phone to dark mode always as a hack for Amoled phones really helps.. Also twerking the battery settings n usage pattern/ background performance of apps goes a long way to improve battery life on present day phones and that helps here too.. very satisfied with battery life overall while standby times don't seem great but that's a minor gripe.. Supplied fast charger is a monster and one of the highlights of the phone! It's an absolute treat to charge the phone so quickly.. but the phone does get warm with charge but nothing alarming or worrying anyways..

Overall improving the rating due to its overall performance..

March 6th:-
Got my phone from Amazon on 6th March & I already own a Samsung Note 20 Ultra. I saw a major difference between both screens in display!.. When I do some R&D I found out the iQOO 9 Pro display has Green & Magenta tint issue!!.. Also the Screen Test Pro app showed that the phone Screen Leak issue!!..

I have requested for a return of this phone. Guys please be aware of this issue which is a Quality Consistency issue from iQOO!.. I find that even earlier iQOO phones like 7 & 7 Legend had these issues very commonly!!.. So don't be fooled by all the On Paper Specs & the expert reviews ok YouTube!!..

FYI my wife owns an iPhone 12 & I own Samsung Note 20 Ultra and both phones have a top notch display that showed the chalk n cheese between them and iQOO!!.."
3464,3.0,"Overall, I like IQOO 9 Pro.

But not able to accept the issues which I observed in 10 days.

I bought IQOO 9 Pro in the last week and using it for 9 days. I am just disappointed!

Below are few issues which facing and these are very basic interactions with any device but not working:

1. I was playing song in Spotify, I wanted to change the song after 10 minutes then unlocked and did slide down status bar but Spotify app was not there. It expect me to open Spotify app again from the home screen. Felt very bad.

2. I got a WhatsApp notification in the status bar while using Google map, wanted to check my WhatsApp message so I did slid down the status bar but notification list was not showing my WhatsApp message.

3. I am using a 6 digit number to unlock my phone, when I try to enter these 6 numbers in the same speed as how I used to try in any other basic model smart phones but it's not unlocking the screen. It works only when I type my 6 digit numbers very slowly.

4. Lock screen is flickering when I type my 6 digit pin, really it's annoying me.

5. I have set auto brightness in my phone. I made a WhatsApp video call and when I finished my WhatsApp video call screen brightness we t to very high automatically and it didn't reduce even though I reduced brightness manualy. It came to normal after I locked and unlocked the screen.

These are all very basic usages. Please do the needful to fix these issues and give priority to device and software stability..

I expect to get a software update to have fixes for all these issues and make the software bug free..

I contacted support team, they gave me convincing words and asked me to give the phone for physical inspection. They told they will arrange a pick up to collect my phone. But I didn’t get any further information/update from them. I m just disappointed with all☹️"
3465,4.0,"This review would be big, so please have a patience.

I came after op5t. It is a monster phone wrt to build quality and everything. Some of the things which I like to have in a phone is:

1. Core android experience as far as possible.
2. Don't give the feature, its ok, but if giving the feature please test all the edge cases.
3. Give user the ability to sideload the custom rom, (ok you can void the warranty, if its in warranty) or give the option like op where you can unlock the bootloader then sideload and in case you have an issue, please lock the bootloader and have original recovery with original os then go to service center.
4. Please test the core functionalities 3x number of times then the functionalities which might be used once in a while, for example: My default launcher sometimes goes blank and i have no other option then to restart.

Now coming to this phone, I waited a long long time to buy the phone you can easily understand my last phone IS (not was, is) op5t which is still running with Android 11 (custom rom, sideloaded it by unlocking the bootloader), and its kind a good(not the awesome, but ok) now.

1. I bought iqoo9 pro phone and spent 70k on it, my first expectation will be experience should be seamless, but you can feel many a time that the flow is missing or the seamlessness is missing.
2. for example: many times my PIP (Picture in Picture) does not show shortcuts to play pause close it.
3. I really don't like the launcher, its so basic literally why, if you can't put an effort just ask the user which launcher to use nova, lawnchair or something, in that way the swipe gesture to last app will work, FYI, swipe gesture to last app only works with default launchers and not with 3rd party installed launcher, please google it you will understand what I am saying
4. There are no Android 12 widgets, like the clock the weather widget or the contact one, I mean why, 70k phone is there man, please provide
5. Vivo is not allowing the user to do the sideload of custom rom, (facepalm) why, you are worrying about user having the bricked handset, let him do whatever he wants to with the phone you just void the warranty and mention in policy we will not take the custom rom sideloaded phone or unlocked bootloader phone, simple.
6. The live wallpaper provided with the default installation does not works in the Default Launcher, although works in Lock screen, but not in home screen, (facepalm), come on man so basic stuff to test.
7. You can't change the icon shapes in the notification drawer, its squarish and be with it, like Vivo doesn't care if you like to have circle icons, (facepalm) moment again.
8. Bloatwares, so many of them, God why I need browser when you are giving chrome with the default installation, so you think user will use your browser on top of chrome (really). All the power users either use chrome or install any other available browsers and not use yours, that is for sure.

Now coming to the pros:

1. Camera is good no doubt in that, it takes some really good shots, and I appreciate that, but but but, the border detection program needs A LOT (A LOT) improvement.
2. Touch response is good, and I love it.
3. Charging is the MVP, man literally 20 25 mins full charge and I hardly worry about the battery anymore.
4. The style statement, no doubt its good, although I feel designer should have utilised the camera modules remaining part much efficiently, but thats ok.
5. The display, oof awesome, just awesome.
6. The curved screen is good in hand feel.
7. And no doubt its a good phone, but for a phone of 70k i feel my asks were not that of a big deal.

Edit#1: Returned the phone back on 4th April and waiting for refund, hope it will happen soon, but really felt bad in returning coz I took this phone after a long long wait, and did not go well, will update once the refund start.

Edit#2: Got the refund in the CC statement this month, although, I took one lesson, never return that is in EMI and that too in CC, it was a headache, chasing for so long, to get the refund, also, picked on 4th and the update came by 21 that the phone reached their centre after that it took 5 working days, leaving sat and sun, then ICICI took 2 days time to reflect,"
3466,4.0,"Being an OnePlus user for 4 years, I switched to this device with mixed feeling. But, after 3 days of usage I am satisfied so far.
Pros:
- Looks really great 👍. Feels nice in hand, though it's a heavy phone.
- Fast finger print unlock. I was using a OnePlus 6 and the physical finger print reader started to age - it would often fail to unlock. Not here. The unlock is consistent and fast.
- Battery and Charging is a pleasant experience. To see phone getting charged in around 15 mins from 10% was a new experience.
- Call quality : Till now never had an issue and this is a biggest positive for me so far. Call over wifi is great.
- WiFi connectivity : Works like a charm and connectivity doesn't get lost even when the signal is poor. This is a delightful experience since I take lot of zoom calls on my phone.
- Love the haptic feedback.
- Camera : I have been very happy with my OnePlus 6 cameras and I had seen lot of review/comparison of the cameras of IQOO 9PRO. Again this was an area of doubt for me and till now I am pleased with the choice. The camera system has some issues with focus in close distance which is disturbing but other than that it's good enough for my occasional photography. Watch out for some wiered colour in the low light captures (may be over sharpening) but good thing is I didn't need night mode.

Cons:
A smart phone isn't smart enough if it fails to address daily usage requirement by providing a complete experience and in that aspect there noticable short comings (and my mind will not stop comparing with OnePlus 6).
- OS Experience : It is good and has many customisations but the ease of use factor is missing. Example : You swipe down from middle of the screen hoping the notification tray to open but it opens a search and it was not apparent how to change this. It's such a messy experience, specially with a big screen like this!
Or you can search the sound profile to customise it for different situations but God knows where it's hidden.
- Screen : 120Hz is great experience for someone like me, coming from 60Hz but colour profile was not pleasing. I had to alter few settings to get it to my liking. For flagship screen, this was a letdown.
- Audio jack missing : This is touted as a gaming friendly phone and there no IP certification as far as I know, then why remove the 3.5 mm jack? Please note the provided type-C to 3.5mm connector works like a charm.
- Gets warm when I use it with Android auto for driving, not sure if this will go away later.
Verdict : I got a sweet deal with exchange of my old phone and using an SBI card togather. For the 48k that I finally paid for this phone, I am pleased with my purchase so far.
25/03 : The small ui glitches are everywhere! So much so that now I am feeling stupid to not have gone with a more reputed brand! Ex - message app : Pinning a message won't work, grouping doesn't work consistently. Settings : there occassions when we do a change and it doesn't get saved at all."
3467,3.0,"Curved Edge, I've been looking for that for a long time with the Specs I look forward. Not all the Spec Expectations are available especially Battery, but a nice weighful Phone with an addictive look to expose and to stare at."
3468,5.0," Disclosure: I have been a Vivo fan and my last phone was Vivo Nex.

It's been 2 days with the phone now. I've updated the phone to the latest firmware and all apps are upto date. I don't use GPS, and almost always my phone is on data and not wifi and background apps are shut off.

1. Battery Drain

- Even after all the above mentioned settings, the battery drain was unbelievably tremoundous. On a simple YouTube video of 144 fps with manual screen brightness in a normally lit room, the battery was draining 2% at the end of 3-4 min YouTube video.

- The main problem was the battery drain when the phone was on standby. As I said, my phone wasn't connected to internet or searching for wifi at standby. I slept at 70% in the night and woke up to a 56% in the morning after 7 hours.

- My phone was at 94% when I started writing this review. Right now it's 90% at the end of 5 minutes writing in below average brightness and default settings of refresh rates and screen resolution.

2. Spontaneous Hanging

Screen recording sample is attached herewith of two instances. First sample shows random disappearance of home screen icons and the app drawer not responding to commands.

The second sample shows YouTube app malfunctioning. This however I believe can be fixed with a firmware update.

3. 'Supposed 120 watt fast charging'

With the settings as mentioned above, my phone took 35 minutes to full charge from 1% to 100% . But my phone didn't heat up, so it's a nice add on. But the claim of 20 mins isn't true, at least for the device that I got.

4. Subpar front camera

I've attached a sample of the front camera trying to record a product I got from Amazon. I'm trying to focus the camera on to the product but it's neither autofocussing not manually focussing.

Upfront, I hated that the autofocus on the secondary camera is bad! I didn't expect this from a device which costs a premium. The skin colour reproduction is very artificial but I like that their automatic beautification of the skin thereby softening all features is less this time. But yet, something needs to be done about the autofocus. I clicked at least 20 times for the lens to focus on me but it failed every single time, so I had to give up.

That being said some of the highlights of the phone are:

- Absolutely stunning display.
- Good stereo speakers
- SP 8 Gen 1 (Unfortunately it's battery drain is real as well)
- The physical aesthetics of the device
- Good quality USB Type c to Type C cable and providing free good quality case and Type C to 3.5 mm jack adapter. In a world of taking away charging adapters from the box, these bundles are a breath of fresh air.
- Great unboxing experience with the premium box.

My summary:

- Average Camera
- Below average battery
- Average UI
- Awesome display
- Awesome processing power
- Awesome aesthetics

IQOO/Vivo, if you are reading this, please fix these problems with the next firmware update."
3469,5.0,"I'm writing a review for the first time for any of my owned smart phones till date. I pre-ordered IQOO 9 Pro on the launch date it-self i.e. 23rd February and got it on 11th March (a long long wait). I would like to point out few positives and negatives about this phone which I've observed till now:

Positives:
1. Screen of the phone is amazing, the minimum and maximum brightness is class leading. It is easily legible in direct sun light and low minimum brightness doesn't strain the eyes in dark room. You won't find a better display (2k resolution, dynamic 1-120hz refresh rate, 1500 nits peak brightness) phone in this price segment.

2. The fingerprint reader of the phone has biggest reading surface area in any phone including all US and Chinese brands. The unlock speed is on-par with latest S22 series. It is a ultrasonic fingerprint reader not the optical one like all other android phone (excluding Samsung top dogs). It works with wet fingers without any issues. If you finger is very dry then it takes more time to unlock the phone.

3. On the camera front, the main (50MP Samsung (S5K)GN5 1/1.57"") and ultrawide (50MP Samsung (S5K)JN1 1/2.76"") camera sensors are class leading. 2.5x optical and front camera usage same (16MP Samsung S5K3P9 1/3.1"") censor which is above average but not class leading. Photos from main and ultrawide are excellent. Contrast, dynamic range, saturation and noise levels of main and ultrawide cameras are flagship grade.

4. IQOO 9 Pro does have an IR blaster, that means you can control your TV, Set-top box and AC using the phone. This feature might not sound very compelling at first but it is very handy specially if you are having faulty remotes with some non-working buttons.

5. Call quality and signal reception is very good. The earpiece sound output is very loud and rich.

6. It has stereo speakers and sound output it very good and loudness is also great. One issue I would like to point out is that, the volume is YouTude application is very low as compared to other apps. If you play YouTube videos on chrome browser then the sound output is loud. This is a software bug specific to YouTube app only and should get resolved in future updates.

7. Build quality and in-hand feel is very premium. The glass sandwich design with curved display looks top class.

8. Charging speed is just insane, plugin the phone and goto shower and by the time you come, it's already 100%.

-Negatives:
1. No official IP rating for a phone costing this much.

2. I couldn't digest why IQOO didn't use USB Type C standard 3.1 or higher so that we can get wired display output from the phone. The IQOO 9 Pro has USB Type C 2.0 standard with does not support wired display output.

3. Telephoto and Front camera hardware could have been better.

4. No bootloader unlock supported that means no rooting and no custom rom.

As the endnote, this phone has some cutting edge hardware which you won't find in any smartphone. I'm impressed with this phone and would buy it again if given the chance."
3470,4.0,"On paper great specs, and look and build quality, but what can I say 9 months since purchase..and still having software stability issues..dint expect that from a flagship...so selling it off and picking up Google pixel even though its lower specs."
3471,2.0,Very Good
3472,4.0,"Review edited after 1 month.

Pros:
- Super fast charging with 120W, which peaks at 101W don't know why.

- SD 8 Gen 1 and LPDDR5 RAM very smooth experience. UFS 3.1 storage.

- Qualcomm Ultrasonic fingerprint scanner. Super fast and secure.

- 2K E5 Amoled with120Hz display. Not LTPO 2.0 as described in website. Smart option takes from 30-120. If it's LTPO 2.0 AMOLED it should at least go as low 1Hz to save battery.

- 4700mah battery. Gives on average 10hrs of screentime without gaming.

- Camera module. 50MP Gimbal main + 50MP 150° ultra wide + 16MP OIS telephoto. I got some good clicks but many saying bad don't know why.

Cons:
- UI/UX worst no regular updates no customization. Rectangle notification icons which manufacturer gives rectangle icons in 2022. Zero customization.

- Charger makes a weird buzzing sound when charging at peak or when display is on during charging. My phone heats up to 40-44°C even with cooling equipment inside the hood while charging.

- Battery drain SD 8 Gen 1 is power hungry chip. Drains lot of battery even phone is idle. Frequently observed 20% power drain over night with no background application. May be a Software update can fix this. But I'm not confident that IQOO / Vivo gives any damn about customers issues.

- Updates very less compared to Oneplus or Samsung. IQOO only gives 2 android upgrades and 3 years security updates, worst for a flagship.

- IQOO or Vivo have zero successful flagships, being their first flagship I should have waited for one plus 10 pro.

- Bug fixes are never received via OTA. They fix one and add many bugs, their updates are very inconsistent and lame.

- No accessories available for this product in market from good brands like Spigen, Rhinosheild etc., not even Vivo or IQOO gives good accessories for their phone. Case in box matches phone but its very loose and slippery. I have contacted IQOO service center for free screen protector as promised but they don't have them in stock.

- The User Experience is worst in this mobile. Not even as refined as MIUI or even Oppo's ColorOS. Lot of bugs while using mobile. Home screen is worst of worst no customization whatsoever. Android 12 is best customizable in History of android, with 12 out of box this is worst OS. FUNTOUCH OS IS THE WORST OS IN THE ANDROID COMMUNITY.

****Humble suggestion better buy Oneplus 10 pro or Motorola Edge 30 pro. If you can double the price Samsung S22 Ultra. Don't purchase and regret buying this mobile.****

*****FINALLY IF IQOO OR VIVO REPRESENTATIVES SEE THIS REVIEW. FIX YOUR OS. DON'T LAUNCH A HALF COOKED PRODUCT AND BOAST ABOUT IT. UNDERSTAND CUSTOMER ISSUES AND TRY TO RESOLVE THEM.*****"
3473,4.0,"Hi All,

I received the fone on 5th of March (Legend 12 gb, 256gb) overall the fone looks good.
I got it with a good deal for this fone after an exchange with old fone and ICICI discount. I can tell one thing that people who are planning to spend some amount and for a people above good users can plan for this fone if they are okay with the OS.
I am facing little bit challenges while using this fone as I was a Motorola user with an almost stock Android user.
But this fone has some good features compare to other fones.
Here are few things I liked and didn't like. But this like and dislike is not a pros and cons. FYI.
Likes:
Has a fast charge and don’t have to worry about battery drain as this fone charges in 20 to 25 mins 100%.
Looks great in hand and if its black this makes still stunning.
Has given 3.5mm jack converter.
Fingerprint scanner is so accurate and unlocks very fast in a wider area.
With the case provided in the box also supports wireless charging after a test I did. I like that option. But the case is smooth and slippery.
The fone supports lots of 5g bands and down the lane this should work.
The camera pics are pretty good as I am not a guy clicks lots of pic’s but its better than my previous Motorola fone. So, I am happy.
Performance is great as 8 Gen1 is very fast and robust.
Dislikes:
The fone is slippery as its curvy. I suggest going for a good back cover as the one provided in the box is slippery and looks odd for guys b’coz its white in color.
Fone is lengthy and cannot operate in one hand. Big guys can handle but average and short hands will have a challenge.
I didn’t like the Funtouch OS as I was Motorola user from ages. This has some apps which cannot be removed and modified. (I must get used to this one).

Will use the fone more and will provide the review in next 3 to 4 months of time.

Thank you All."
3474,5.0,"DO NOT INSTALL tempered glass as the finger print sensor will not work thereafter.
Phone already installed with a screen protector that does the basic job.

The high power charger makes faint hissing noise while charging."
3475,4.0,"Previously I was used S21 Fe 256 gb variant . It was around 58k. I was satisfied but I was missing speedy and snappy performence as we get in flagship phone and also haptics , fast charging also not good. but one UI and service support is amazing in Samsung. My brother is using s21 ultra he is mostly satisfied with that. But he is a lite user. But in that phone also I was noticed performence and optimisation issues after 8 months of usage (especially camera focussing and quality issues after update)and charging speeds also very less. So I was decided to go for out and out performer.
That is the reason I took iqoo 9 pro for 58k.

Now best things about the device....
1. Best indisplay fingerprint scanner in the world right now( Samsung also behind in this)
2. Best 2k Ltpo 2.0 display....diffinetly this is the best in segment (for 58k). Quality is superb and sharp and very bright panel. but not up to Samsung dynamic amoled level. (Even though this display is provided by samsung itself)
3.120w flash charging top up battery in 0 to 100 in 23 mins 30 to 90 in 11 mins.(tested)
4. Snappy super cool performence, flyes through every tasks. (8 gen 1) no over heating issues.
5.8gb ram with 256 gb rom variant. (This is the pro point i feel, other brands giving 8 and 128 gn variant)
6. Good set of cameras ( no gimmics 2 mp macro bla bla etc)
7. Great haptic feedback.
8.excellent build quality.... Feel premium ness in your hand, weight distribution also good.
7. Finally gaming i am a casual gamer....this is the beast in gaming performence. Super snappy and 4d vibration, memc technology is a boon for gamers.
8. Wireless charging and reverse wireless is a cherry on the top. (Because i have wireless charger and galaxy watch 4)

Now it's Cons time:
1. Funtounch is not up to flagship level. Here and there noticing some optimisation issues.
2. Cameras performing well for this price range...but not flagship worthy.( Especially on potrait mode)
3. Stereo speakers are mostly average. (Clear but not loud)
4. Battery giving up to on an avg 5 hours of Sot. ( 2k screen with 120 hz and 8 gen 1 this is acceptable) in s21 Fe with full hd screen I was getting same back up.

Overall I am totally happy with this device...because I was getting what I was want ( speed and flagship performence). Here Iqoo is giving up to date hardware specs for 58k. I was hoping iqoo and Vivo will give updates on time. (By the way I was got 3 updates since bought this mobile)"
3476,4.0,"I wish they had their own operating system. everything else is up to mark
Funtoush OS is irritating a bit"
3477,4.0, Super
3478,4.0," Phone heats for sure with too much use and also while charging it heats, but with cover its bearable when you using the phone without charger.
Battery drain but for a heavy user like my its giving me battery time upto 5 and half.
Trust me i am mostly on my phone, and i have turned on most of things like NFC, different animations, hypatics are on, i play games then brightness is on full, so many other things.
Intially i got jitters but after update, I restarted phone so far it's going smooth.

Now likes.
Charger is superb as of now i have charged it from 24%, it charged super super quick to 100%
I really liked the in hand feel, bit heavy and big in screen size, i really liked it.
Camera seems good to me in night and day, still gonna use more, but it's good.Takes natural photos you just have switch off AI for that, with AI mode on i liked it.
Face lock and security with finger print is really working great, with finger it took time for me as i press at the bottom of the screen because of my habit with previous phone.
Screen is really bright and crisp.
Update is for Feb only, anroid 12 so many other small things to enjoy.
Need proper software updated to fix bugs in customization. Please Iqoo push proper updates.
Going good so far, got it on heavy discount so i really liked it so far."
3479,4.0,"Battery drain so much even when the device is on standby

Edited (after replacement) : battery is fine now but has heat issue while using camera or taking, guess it will be fix after some optimisation update

Anyway great smart phone and for this price range absolutely beast
Pro: Great camera, night mode etc
Super fast charging 100 in 21 min
Great display
And many more
Cons: heat issue while using camera or taking video, playing games etc
Battery capacity could be more like OnePlus 10 pro
Battery backup not upto the mare

Overall performance is good. So go for it"
3480,4.0,"Writing a review after three months of usage. I would feel that either the Xiaomi 12 pro or One plus 10 pro would have the same pros and cons. For this price range should have gone for Apple 13.

Pros:
Good camera
Battery life
Display
Built up quality
Premium look
Cons:
Video quality - If we take video on direct outdoor with direct exposure to sunlight then phone becomes hot and videos wil come shacky and imperfect
Phone has ceramic back and with company provided case, as day passes it becomes yellow due to daily usage. Pleased go for best and branded back case.
Front camera quality is so mediocre, not upto the mark.
One of the major set back is UI"
3481,5.0,Excellent product but price should be little lower.
3482,4.0,"Powerful device but it has some flaws.
Pros:
* The phone is very snappy and fast. You can handle any task in a blink of an eye. Games are better than op 10 pro as it loads games faster than OnePlus.
* The display is just mind blowing and the smart switch feature is fantastic.. the display is bright, crisp, vibrant and we'll saturated.. watching hdr contents is a treat 😋
* The design is just so stunning and something which you would appreciate.
* Charging speed is really good although it takes 25 mins in my case to charge the phone from 1 to 100.
* Camera is again really good i have seen some comparisons and my friend purchased op 10 pro the rear camera is slightly better than op 10 pro and specially the ultrawide mode can really shoot at a great wide angle which looks more realistic than op. Also, the night mode can can really shoot some bright pics.
* It has IR blaster which means you don't have to ask for remote from your dad 😝 you can operate devices like AC, TV without remote.

Cons:
* First of all the UI sucks all the time it's not at all optimised.. sometimes I notice some frame drops while switching apps. Also, it has a lot of bloatwares.
* Battery backup is not good it's a new phone yet, I charge it almost twice a day some times.
* Camera is really great but I think it could have been better.. if I compare this with Vivo x70 pro plus then Vivo being the last year's flagship outperforms iqoo in most of the scenarios. But it's still great. Night mode shots are good but edges ar not sharp but captures good details.
* Speaker quality is not good. It has dual stereo speakers but the quality is not upto the mark..op 10 pro has better speakers.. they gave an update on speaker quality but the speaker loudness is still not good. Even when you use earphones you will get better output on op 10 pro than this. Sound needs to be optimised a lot if iqoo is watching this review then please work on it..

Verdict: you can go for it.. it has flagship specs but only if you can consider these flaws."
3483,5.0,"Switched from OnePlus 8 Pro to iQoo 9 Pro. Expectations were already high and upto an certain extent it does feel satisfactory but also feels some off things which I'll mention in MISSES below.

BONUS - 1.
Display is beyond Excellence and I wish to keep looking@the screen cntnsly. Kept screen at Smart Switch and it goes best Refresh Rate automatically handled as per the screen usage. No Accidental Touches on Curved Screen.
2. Overall Hardware looks pretty decent and attractive but I personally do not go with how it looks outside but how it behaves Inside. Sporty Stripes are just as useless as they are on real BMW vehicle. Asthetic attraction.
3. Connected to my Home wifi which delivers upto 96 MBPS. Tested download speed on phone and it reached 14.8.MBPS highest I have visually witnessed on any device ever.
4. Camera Test Pending.
5. Battery charging at 120 Watt is just Unbelievable to watch. Drained 1st charge at 6%- Plugged in the Fast charger-10 mins into charging and it was 91%. And battery doesn't drain as much as far experienced. Will test Wireless charging in a day or two.

MISSES -
1. IP66+ rating. Spending a lot from pocket and no IP rating is little demeaning.
2. Feels slightly over priced considering the brand is still not built as compared to other pros in the market.(OnePlus,Samsung,Oppo,Xiaomi)
3. Too big and Protruding Camera Panel. Feels like designer was given too much of free space and he built a Brick wall at back of the phone."
3484,3.0,"I wanted to switch to better display from my current Samsung Galaxy A52 due to eye strain and irritation. Hence was looking for display offering 3200 X 1440 resolution display. Saw this phone which offers QHD+ LTPO display and with top notch hardware specs. However was hesitant to pay such a price for the brand which not popular. But as I got good exchange price and some discount, dared to buy this one. After usage for few days, jotting down my observations below

Screen Resolution:
Initial setup itself revealed by my urge of switching to a better display is addressed. The phone presents gorgeous screen which is preventing any eye strain for me. There are 3 color options and I use standard one which is more bright compared to professional mode (which may suit some of the people). Dynamic refresh adjusts automatically as per need.

Audio:
Phone speaker are very good and sounds quite loud. Sound is also well balanced highlighting low and mid more to my liking. Phone offers various customization options to further adjust the audio. Not new compared to Galaxy S series. I however found audio output bit low through bluetooth and wired earphones (I am using Huawei True wireless and Boat wired) earbuds. May be over the year headphones will be loud enough.

Camera:
I typically clicks only 10-12 photos a year and hence this really doesn't matter much to me. However the photos looked great to me but as I am not photography enthusiast, cannot really comment.

Battery:
Easily lasts for more than a day. Additionally when you have 120 W flash charge, there is not worry about battery. It charges in less than 20 Minutes as we generally do not wait till full battery drain

Others:
1) Phone has fantastic eye-catching design and should work well with most.
2) Ultrasonic fingerprint scanner is simply amazing.
3) It seems that the phone has IR blaster as the Smart Remote App (pre-installed) perfectly works with almost all my home appliances.
4) I do not see any issues with Funtouch OS also. It provides required functions easily.

Negatives:
Not much really but I mentioned about low audio on earbuds. Further for such premium phone, IQOO should remove some of unnecessary the pre-installed apps.

Overall a nice purchase. Satisfied after few days of usage."
3485,3.0,my Suggestion is go with IQOO 9 / 9T which is much better than this and prices is also low.

1. Despite the features camera quality is a mixed bag. At times shoots great low lights pics and at times it's atrocious. 8 k video is nothing great.
2. Battery consumption is fairly high.
Heavy usage of phone means it won't last beyond 6-7 hours. Regular ~ 12. Low usage probably 20 hours
3. Fingerprint reader requires me to press my finger quite hard to detect. It's a pain.
Overall a good phone
But the camera needs to be consistent"
3487,4.0,"Don't consider those negative reviews. This mobile is awesome. If you are coming from low end or mid range Device this mobile will surprise you. I'm writing this review after 1 day usage, I mean I used it for nearly18 hours and looked into every corner of the mobile and tested out everything.
Display - 9/10
Camera - 9/10
Battery-7/10 (discharge is happening slightly fast but can be improved when it's getting update)
Charging -9/10 ( heats up Little bit) , ( full charge in 20mins)
Gaming - 9/10 (heating only in ultra HD graphics)
UI - 8/10 ( I'm coming from pixel experience so trust me this UI is really awesome when you are from other UI full of bloatware and irritating things, some minor bugs are there but can be removed by updating)
Speaker - 10/10 ( impressive speaker, louder and very good clarity) (even half the volume it over takes my realme 4k TVs volume 😂)
Call quality - 9/10
Multimedia - 10/10 ( if you are watching movies and series all the time just go for it)

Don't forget to maintain your battery health, charge only 1 or 2 times in a day and maintain 20-90% always."
3488,3.0,"Hardware of the mobile is pretty good. Fast charging, Responses and finger print are quite good.
But the OS is really lacks many features compared to Samsung or Oneplus. Quite disappointed with it. Wanted to give 2 stars due to hardware quality giving 3 starts."
3489,5.0,"After 8 months Using I'm writing this review.

Initially I gave 3*/5 with 2 days of usage,

After update.
After 3 months of using
Now I'm giving 4.7*/5

Now ots 8 months of usage
I gave 4.8*/5

But after using two months my opinion is changed.

# Design and Body of mobile 📲 5*/5.

# Edge Display 📱 5*/5

# 🔊 Speaker 🔊 5*/5 out put quality is very clarity.

# Call Quality 5*/5

# Camera 📸/🤳 5*/5 both Especially back cam Portrait nailed it.

#Finger Print top in it's kind super fast.(before applying matte tampered glass make sure it will work for finger 🤞 print perfectly or not.
In my case my matte tampered glass not allowed finger print scanner.)

#Face unlock 🔓 excellent.

# Wireless Charging 5*/5 Unbelievable fast.

# The best part is u will get type-C to 3.5mm Jack in box 🎁

# Last but not least Charging speed 8Mins to 50% 18 Mins to 100%.
(After 8 months i noticed if i charge with laptop it gives very good backup than vooc 120w)

# Battery 🔋🔋 BackUp also excellent 👌👍 for moderate user it will gives 1.5 days for minimal usages.

(If you want to achieve fast charging,
disable wifi, Bluetooth, gps and connect mobile to charger. Don't use at all while charging. Mobile data is not a problem).

I'm in Hyderabad I'm ising airtel 5G without any problem.
Recently I got 13 update as well few improvements are there extra smooth UI.

( My personal suggestion connect charger when battery is 22%-25%. Remove when it reaches 93%-96% don't connect upto 100%. If you follow my tips your battery life will improve a lot )

I brought mobile for 48K only.
after ICICI & Old mobile exchange.

Initially I'm wrong about mobile now Im Happy.

Mobile really worth it.

(4.8 bcz Mobile after 13 update no heat while charging)

Not a water Resistant but Splash , Dust Proof.
Need to Improve some more features.)"
3490,4.0,"Hardware of the phone, without doubt is top notch. The finger print reader especially works like a charm. The 120W charging and 4700 mah battery back up are the wndt highlights, too good. Coming to the performance it's very good from the hardware side. Camera is very good too. Software side needs fixes. Funtouch is fun but not very reliable at times; negligible glitches here and there which can be corrected through software upgrades.

Overall worth it. I exchanged my OnePlus 6T for 11800 alo with 6000 Cashback on credit card. Actual price: 64+K; Post exchange and Cashback: 45K."
3491,4.0,"I bought this device twice as the 1st device I received having faulty battery. Sadly I didn't get a replacement but I recived refund so I have to order again.
It provides an average battery back up like 5 hrs on continuous screen on time aslo it keep dropibg battery level quickly while daily uses like call or messaging. it Drops exact 20% battery for bgmi in every hour. Sometime it took more than usual time to fully charged like 25-28 minutes. Game lags if you make the screen recorder on for 15 minutes. Display and bulid quality are most powerful and provides awesome performance at outside.I dropped this device twice but no damages without screen guard as Curve screen has to come with U V ray glass and the finger sensor won't work , so have to use with screen guard.
Overally premium phone in display and build quality but not recommended in this price range as they could have optimised the device more for stable perfomance."
3492,4.0, If i talk about the shape it has nice look and design. Slightly slippery when i hold but its manageable. The phone was 28% charged when i booted it i did all the formalities setting up the device and all. I also got an system update and i downloaded it. The phone went warm while the things were going on and i also noticed frame drops when i updated my phone but it is normal because the phone was warm and it was just updated. One thing i was confused about was battery. It gave me 30 minutes of backup i guess.... when i did all the things. And i think its good because i did alot of things updating the phone checking all the apps and all stuff you do on your new phone. These were my first impressions and overall it was a good experience 4 stars from my side. I only wrote the problems i faced and the things i didn't write about are top notch. This phone is amazing you can go for it.
3493,5.0, Camera & battery all are nice superb phone
3494,3.0,"Cons:

1. THIS IS THE MAIN ISSUE. Fix your OS. too buggy. and all the unwanted pre-installed software is useless.

2. please dont buy this phone for camera quality. my 3 yo asus 6z can take better pics in multiple situations. the camera is so slow to click a picture I can go get a cup of coffee and its still asking me to hold it steady to take the pic and is still loading. this needs to be fixed ASAP. if you cant fix this issue dont market it as gimbel camera. because that makes almost no difference. every customer always wants a point and shoot camera which can click pictures faster. this is a mobile phone and not a professional camera

3. some apps are incompatible but this is a little rare
4. could have had a headphone jack but oh well. everyone wants to follow apple. take out headphone jack. Hey atleast 120W charger comes with the box be happy

Pros:
1. charging speed. dont mind people complaining about charging speed. this phone charges in 20 minutes if you leave the phone alone and do something else. this is not advertised as a gaming phone that charges in 20 minutes on the go.
2. screen
3. decent battery life. people complaining about battery life, reduce the resolution and refresh rate. no phone can give you more than 3-4 hours screen on time with 1440p 120hz
4. speakers"
3495,4.0,"prons
1 superb display and fingerprint reader
2 super camera quality
3 good looking
4 fast charging

cons
1 battery drains faster.. even in stand by mode which losses 1 persent in every 8 min.. if we unplug after full charge at morning 9 battery becomes empty at evening 7.. if we use camera, by evening 4 ith will die..
2 heating while using camera.. video recording gets jerky in a lengthy recording.
3 software is average.. animations are not smooth
4 not optimised.. it have 8 gen 1 but we are not getting it's actual power..
5 not optimised we have ltpo 2 display but refresh rate shifting is not in professional manner..

verdict..
best hardware with least optimisation with weakest battery.. but a price of 59000 including offers its worthy"
3496,3.0,"This is my conclusion of 6 days of usage.
Like - charging speed (16-20minutes), Display (best one for me yet), fingerprint reader (3d sonic scanner really good but still not as fast as built in body scanner), camera (good overall)
Dislike - bloatware (absolutely hate and the sole reason of not recommending this), idle power consumption (battery drains even if you are not doing anything), NO HEADPHONE JACK (there is a dongle in the box but why not give it in the body), Average speakers (good but could have been a little bit louder)

Lastly I would only say in conclusion that if you are buying this for the sole purpose of gaming then there are better options than to buy this. I had bought this as a daily overall good phone to use but so far it has been only good for gaming. YouTube watching hours are good too. The absolutely reason for not recommending this is 'the bloatware are permanent'. Most of them. If anyone finds a way to uninstall them then please. I'll be really thankful. And the phone does heatup while charging although nothing alarming. I would to wait for the time it charges and do something else for the time it charges. I played bgmi classic matches for approx 5 hours. This is my first iqoo phone and I seriously didn't like the overall experience."
3497,4.0,"I've been using the device for over 3 months now, Obviously when you pay this amount for the phone is not going to be crap but its no where near perfect. I bought it because of 8gen1 but now regret because of it . Lol be careful what you wish for."
3498,5.0,"Super performance
Great and beautiful display
Excellent camera
Battery performance is good
Finger sensor is excellent

Overall an excellent experience with this beautiful 😍 smartphone."
3499,1.0," I know we can't judge the whole brand by this 1. But trust me it has so many defects, over-heating feels like a hot metal in your pocket (just record 2-3 4k videos), no hardware quality in camera module, OIS motor goes round and round (check the attached video from 00:18 secs) etc.. Plz Don't buy to support the new brand with good specs which i did, with especially low grade scam premium service like IQOO center, they themselves says heating is common on IQOO products if we use camera or watch more videos which i didn't see on other metal devices like OnePlus and Xiaomi. I got these issues with in first use of 3-4 hrs after full charge. Unfortunately, i was out of station and couldn't return product in time like 1 day.. even if the seller can give me a refund with a cut of 5k, i would happily take the deal.
So called premium service centers couldn't help you with anything. They themselves will not have stock will take easily 10-15 days but we can find it on ecommerce sites, that's how pathetic IQOO is organized. they couldn't reach out to HOs and speak. They will be there only to pass info as a proxy, they are of no use. Even they don't bother to call you rather they expect us to call and know about the status, and it seems they don't have time to listen to us and says they had work which i don't know what a service center guy does other than supporting the customer :( , that's how premium is the service of IQOO. i had seen a weird policy of replacement, they doesn't replace the whole box, they only take the handset from the new box and replace the old one with the new cable etc.. and send it back to factory. Most probably I got one of these kind of defect pieces.. Don't at all trust the word premium service, it's all scam and i can write pages but lastly i would say don't go for IQOO product-wise and escpecially service wise. Thank You IQOO..

Update 1: mobile is been more than 2 weeks like 17 days at the premium service center.. no mobile replacement done.. even after 1 month purchase, no mobile at my hand. So don't buy IQOO phones, their service is the worst. I think they are launching some other phones Z6 pro etc.. don't fall in their trap.

Update 2: Just got an update it will take again a week to get my mobile. Thank You #IQuestOnAndOn4MyMobile (IQOO)

Update 3: Just i called the service center guys for 100 times got the status, saying mobile got delayed due to saturdays and sundays. #IQuestOnAndOn4MyMobile (IQOO)"
3500,4.0,"I have been using phone for a while , phone is fully loaded with features and feels premium with super fast charging to 100% within 15-20 min , only problem is it's battery life as it drains quickly, which is a very big negative point for such an expensive smartphone."
3501,4.0,"Things which are cons

3502,5.0,"I've been a OnePlus user for the past 6 years. Decided to take a leap of faith with the purchase of 9pro. I've been using it for the past 2 weeks and I'm very happy with the purchase.

The phone is built well and the design is impressive. You won't mistake it for any other phone. it feels premium to hold and the camera bump actually makes the large phone easier to hold. Buttons are clicky and well built but I do miss the alert slider.

The screen is top notch. Great colours and brightness, super responsive. I've set it to 120hz permanently. Speakers are excellent. Good to watch your fav shows without a headset. The cameras are great too. The IR blaster is a welcome feature, means you don't have to keep searching for any remotes.

My main concern was the OS. Coming from oxygen OS I had my fair share of doubts about Funtouch OS. Some features are not as easy to access as in colorOS but other than that the UI has really grown on me. Funtouch OS has come a long way but oxygen OS still has the edge here.

120watts charging is a life saver. the phone always tops up to 100% within minutes. Battery life is however average and can barely make thru a day.

I've found some random bugs here and there such as the playstore being a bit jittery and whatsapp cam not able to take photos. Hopefully it gets ironed out in software updates.

I've seen some comments where some people have received faulty screen, heating issues etc. So far I've not faced any such problems."
3503,5.0,"I ain't a heavy gamer. I play 8 ball pool, cricket n ludo :p . And For normal day to day regular use, It is not heating up at all. UI is super smooth.

No lags nothing. Huge curved display. Super fast ui. So yeah till now its going great for me. Cheers!"

3507,3.0,"After using 2 month my honest review.

Pros:-
1. Nice display
2. Superb finger print censor.
3. Curved design
4. Camera
5. Charging speed

Cons:-
1. DisCharging speed is as fast as charging.
2. Complete unfit phone to use in India in summer.
3. Super heating issue. During charging, during WhatsApp call, during normal call, video call you can say anything & yes it heating everytime.
4. If you are a gamer , boss don't go with adds ,it's unable to balance heat with WhatsApp. Don't know if company is working on it or not.
5. Minor ui glitch( which is fine & gradually will be fixed, not a big deal)

Overall feedback:- if you are worried for old phone that is getting heat. They avoid this phone. I switched from OnePlus 6 due to heating issue. I feel sorry for me. Look wise & add wise it's flagship. That's all"
3508,5.0,"Great performance , screen and camera"
3509,5.0,"I see many reviews complaining about the phone and I do not understand why? It's not like we live in 40's or 60's. Consumers had enough reviews to read and watch before buying the phone. You knew exactly what you were buying.

Anyways, I wanted two things on my phone fast charging and big screen. Iqoo 9 pro satisfied my requirement and it hasn't disappointed me. Watching videos on YouTube and movies or TV series on Netflix or Hotstar is fun.

People will argue why buy a phone which provides only two years of major Android upgrades and three years of security updates for Rs. 69,990. Let's be honest after a year or two better phones will be available. Also, I won't be using the same phone for more than 2-3 years. I think many people are on the same boat.

I was considering Samsung Galaxy s22 models but it charges so slow and Realme gt 2 pro the signature of whoever that guy is turned me off. I don't want any signature on my phone even if it's of a very famous person. I don't want it. People gonna say why not OnePlus 10 pro. No thanks, I don't want a phone whose camera setup looks like my 4 stove burner. So, IQ00 9 PRO was the PERFECT phone for me."

3512,5.0,"Update - Aug 8th:-

Bought Xiaomi 12 Pro today which will be replacing my iQOO 9 Pro.. Got the 12 Pro for 50K!! after discounts.. As I compare the 12 Pro is slightly better than 9 Pro due to top notch hardware & QC in hardware.. Also MiUI clearly shows it's superiority straight away!.. My last post here n good luck to all the iQOO 9 Pro buyers.. As my last rating I still retain 4/5 for 9 Pro & there are certain features I'm going to miss for sure like say the superior selfie cam & worlds best fingerorint sensor for example.. But every phone has its advantage & disadvantage that way.. Bye..

Update - Aug 4th:-
The phone continues to be same as my March review. I get prompt monthly security update.. The phone is running July 2022 Android security update from past 15 days for example.. YouTube (my most used app) keeps crashing atleast 2 time everyday!.. the UI still lacks the polish/ aesthetics/ user friendliness of more refined Android UIs of the primary competition.. Funtouch OS has just not improved at all over months.. The cameras remain solid if not overly impressive.. The telephoto cam for example uses digital zooming until 10X!!.. Only after 10X Zoom the optical zoom takes effect n does well.. The selfie cam is still restricted to just 1080p 30fps video at max.. The main rear cam (Samsung GN5) & Ultrawide cam (Samsung JN1) are very good as always.. The speaker quality is impressive for everything other than YouTube app where the loudness is worst!.. The volume n sound quality is impressive otherwise in Spotify/ YouTube Music.. The haptics are decent but I believe it's behind the competition.. also Funtouch is worst in haptics implementation in the UI.. The screen quality is generally very good but the pre applied screen protector gets oily n dirty very easily.. The low brightness dark room view easily shows the screen bleeding in the lower half of the whole screen and since its a hardware issue, nothing much can be done.. The phone just overheats randomly during normal operation.. battery backup has been above average (I always use the phone in 1440p & 120hz combo only).. Antutu score could barely breach 8 lacs rarely.. mostly it is at around 7.5 lacs which is a big disappointment as that's not the score you expect out of a 8Gen1!.. It's more of a Snapdragon 870 level of performance.. Overall to say this phone is amongst the best options in the 50K to 70K range but the Xiaomi 12 Pro is possibly a slightly better phone overall due to better software experience.. Yet these phones are far better value than the overpriced Samsung S22 series.. I still retain 4/5 overall score for this phone..

Update - March 29th:-
Got 2 software updates. One came with March security update & the other said it is to resolve overheating issue on the phone. What it did was restrict the full performance of the phone to a mid ranger level!!.. Now the Antutu score can't even touch 7 lacs overall score and CPU is good for 1.63K!!.. Geekbench figures are like 900+ & 3100+!!.. The phone is able to perform any stress test app completely now!.. The maximum temperature is under control during stress test now (under 45 degrees).. All these benchmark performance apart, the phone is feeling sluggish n working very average in terms of speed & smoothness and this is always in 120hz mode!!.. The phone is overheating unwantedly now in regular use now!.. No difference in battery performance.. iQOO is really really poor in software optimization & experience and it shows!!.. They have just made a great performing phone a sluggish one that's it!!.. Adding on is fingerprint sensor becoming slow over time & even accuracy is reduced!!.. Still retaining 4 stars with a hope that they will do something to resolve all of these issues with an update soon..

Update - March 18th:-
Very happy with the phone performance overall.. Yes my phone does have screen bleeding issue under pitch dark conditions (brightness 20% n above).. Yes dual speaker loudness is Average n most of the times I have to keep the volume at near it's max in YouTube.. But other than these, I'm really happy with the super fast Snapdragon 8 Gen1 processor's performance.. Very good screen quality under normal usage.. Got used to FunTouch OS and now I'm starting to like the iQOO UI's feature rich n neatness.. have removed the unwanted apps easily using the adb function using my laptop.. The camera's front n back are top notch.. the lens' notify us to clean literally every time we shoot & therefore ensuring great pics.. very good battery life that enables a full day use easily.. the haptic motor seems decent now after setting it at the strongest level.. fingerprint sensor's combination of accuracy + security is the best on any smartphone in the world today!.. Overall the phone convinced me to sell my Samsung Note 20 Ultra and make the iQOO 9 Pro my primary phone now.. wish I could give a 4.5/ 5 at this point but don't want to give it a 5 due to aforementioned issues.. so will retain the score at 4 still..

Update - March 8th:-
I got the screen tint issue fixed by doing a factory reset. I found that it's a setting in developer options that needed to be turned off for the issue to be resolved. However still the screen lacks color calibration of a Samsung/ Apple panels still and inspite of being an E5 Amoled panel, still looks like a blue tinged 20K budget Realme Amoled screen!.. The default color settings and options don't help in this matter unfortunately.. The lower half of the phone screen has slight screen bleeding issue to add on!!..

The phones speaker loudness is strictly average shockingly!!.. GSMArena review of iQOO 9 Pro had Very Good rating for speaker loudness but Indian model has very average speaker loudness for media playback!.. surprisingly loudness isn't an issue for speaker calls where it is fine.. i have downloaded a Volume Booster 3rd party app to improve speaker loudness, so that is a workaround and what that also proves is the phone has the hardware to be loud but the stupid software isn't allowing it be fully capable!.. The haptic feedback of the phone is very average and is of my parents' Realme X7 Max/ Master Edition level!!.. The haptic feedback of our Samsung Note 20 Ultra & iPhone 12 are multiple times superior n it's nowhere close!..

The phone has a brilliant camera that goes toe to toe with the likes of top Samsung's & Apples.. Very happy with the cameras overall and that includes brilliant selfie snaps too.. The camera software is also very nice n better than other Android UIs..

UI n Software overall is lacking the features & finess of OneUI/ ColorOS/ MiUI.. hope that gets improved over time.. Google Chrome isn't even working on my phone at all!!.. some app crashes noticed already..

Great network coverage/ reception & call quality so far..

Snapdragon 8Gen1 is a monster n I got a mind-boggling score of 9.75 lacs overall score in Antutu with the CPU consistently scoring over 2 lacs no matter what.. Geekbench scores very also very good at over 1100 single core n 3500+ multi core.. The processor & phone do overheat unbearably while pushed to limits.. for example the phone could not run an Antutu stress test beyond 15 mins as the temperature crosses 45 degrees with ease.. but I'm hoping iQOO push some improvements in the future (I have seen Samsung improve their highly criticised Exynos 990 processor performance by leaps n bounds over time).. Overall very happy with having the best Android processor around..

Phone has brilliant looks but the supplied back cover is very slippery n lacks grip or comfort.. so have to buy a good one..

Fingerprint sensor is just awesome with its technology n the way it works in real life.. face unlock is unsafely fast n can recognise faces when you don't want it to also!!..

Battery life is very good and setting the phone to dark mode always as a hack for Amoled phones really helps.. Also twerking the battery settings n usage pattern/ background performance of apps goes a long way to improve battery life on present day phones and that helps here too.. very satisfied with battery life overall while standby times don't seem great but that's a minor gripe.. Supplied fast charger is a monster and one of the highlights of the phone! It's an absolute treat to charge the phone so quickly.. but the phone does get warm with charge but nothing alarming or worrying anyways..

Overall improving the rating due to its overall performance..

March 6th:-
Got my phone from Amazon on 6th March & I already own a Samsung Note 20 Ultra. I saw a major difference between both screens in display!.. When I do some R&D I found out the iQOO 9 Pro display has Green & Magenta tint issue!!.. Also the Screen Test Pro app showed that the phone Screen Leak issue!!..

I have requested for a return of this phone. Guys please be aware of this issue which is a Quality Consistency issue from iQOO!.. I find that even earlier iQOO phones like 7 & 7 Legend had these issues very commonly!!.. So don't be fooled by all the On Paper Specs & the expert reviews ok YouTube!!..

FYI my wife owns an iPhone 12 & I own Samsung Note 20 Ultra and both phones have a top notch display that showed the chalk n cheese between them and iQOO!!.."
3513,5.0,"Overall, I like IQOO 9 Pro.

But not able to accept the issues which I observed in 10 days.

I bought IQOO 9 Pro in the last week and using it for 9 days. I am just disappointed!

Below are few issues which facing and these are very basic interactions with any device but not working:

1. I was playing song in Spotify, I wanted to change the song after 10 minutes then unlocked and did slide down status bar but Spotify app was not there. It expect me to open Spotify app again from the home screen. Felt very bad.

2. I got a WhatsApp notification in the status bar while using Google map, wanted to check my WhatsApp message so I did slid down the status bar but notification list was not showing my WhatsApp message.

3. I am using a 6 digit number to unlock my phone, when I try to enter these 6 numbers in the same speed as how I used to try in any other basic model smart phones but it's not unlocking the screen. It works only when I type my 6 digit numbers very slowly.

4. Lock screen is flickering when I type my 6 digit pin, really it's annoying me.

5. I have set auto brightness in my phone. I made a WhatsApp video call and when I finished my WhatsApp video call screen brightness we t to very high automatically and it didn't reduce even though I reduced brightness manualy. It came to normal after I locked and unlocked the screen.

These are all very basic usages. Please do the needful to fix these issues and give priority to device and software stability..

I expect to get a software update to have fixes for all these issues and make the software bug free..

I contacted support team, they gave me convincing words and asked me to give the phone for physical inspection. They told they will arrange a pick up to collect my phone. But I didn’t get any further information/update from them. I m just disappointed with all☹️"
3514,5.0,"This review would be big, so please have a patience.

I came after op5t. It is a monster phone wrt to build quality and everything. Some of the things which I like to have in a phone is:

1. Core android experience as far as possible.
2. Don't give the feature, its ok, but if giving the feature please test all the edge cases.
3. Give user the ability to sideload the custom rom, (ok you can void the warranty, if its in warranty) or give the option like op where you can unlock the bootloader then sideload and in case you have an issue, please lock the bootloader and have original recovery with original os then go to service center.
4. Please test the core functionalities 3x number of times then the functionalities which might be used once in a while, for example: My default launcher sometimes goes blank and i have no other option then to restart.

Now coming to this phone, I waited a long long time to buy the phone you can easily understand my last phone IS (not was, is) op5t which is still running with Android 11 (custom rom, sideloaded it by unlocking the bootloader), and its kind a good(not the awesome, but ok) now.

1. I bought iqoo9 pro phone and spent 70k on it, my first expectation will be experience should be seamless, but you can feel many a time that the flow is missing or the seamlessness is missing.
2. for example: many times my PIP (Picture in Picture) does not show shortcuts to play pause close it.
3. I really don't like the launcher, its so basic literally why, if you can't put an effort just ask the user which launcher to use nova, lawnchair or something, in that way the swipe gesture to last app will work, FYI, swipe gesture to last app only works with default launchers and not with 3rd party installed launcher, please google it you will understand what I am saying
4. There are no Android 12 widgets, like the clock the weather widget or the contact one, I mean why, 70k phone is there man, please provide
5. Vivo is not allowing the user to do the sideload of custom rom, (facepalm) why, you are worrying about user having the bricked handset, let him do whatever he wants to with the phone you just void the warranty and mention in policy we will not take the custom rom sideloaded phone or unlocked bootloader phone, simple.
6. The live wallpaper provided with the default installation does not works in the Default Launcher, although works in Lock screen, but not in home screen, (facepalm), come on man so basic stuff to test.
7. You can't change the icon shapes in the notification drawer, its squarish and be with it, like Vivo doesn't care if you like to have circle icons, (facepalm) moment again.
8. Bloatwares, so many of them, God why I need browser when you are giving chrome with the default installation, so you think user will use your browser on top of chrome (really). All the power users either use chrome or install any other available browsers and not use yours, that is for sure.

Now coming to the pros:

1. Camera is good no doubt in that, it takes some really good shots, and I appreciate that, but but but, the border detection program needs A LOT (A LOT) improvement.
2. Touch response is good, and I love it.
3. Charging is the MVP, man literally 20 25 mins full charge and I hardly worry about the battery anymore.
4. The style statement, no doubt its good, although I feel designer should have utilised the camera modules remaining part much efficiently, but thats ok.
5. The display, oof awesome, just awesome.
6. The curved screen is good in hand feel.
7. And no doubt its a good phone, but for a phone of 70k i feel my asks were not that of a big deal.

Edit#1: Returned the phone back on 4th April and waiting for refund, hope it will happen soon, but really felt bad in returning coz I took this phone after a long long wait, and did not go well, will update once the refund start.

Edit#2: Got the refund in the CC statement this month, although, I took one lesson, never return that is in EMI and that too in CC, it was a headache, chasing for so long, to get the refund, also, picked on 4th and the update came by 21 that the phone reached their centre after that it took 5 working days, leaving sat and sun, then ICICI took 2 days time to reflect,"
3515,5.0,"Being an OnePlus user for 4 years, I switched to this device with mixed feeling. But, after 3 days of usage I am satisfied so far.
Pros:
- Looks really great 👍. Feels nice in hand, though it's a heavy phone.
- Fast finger print unlock. I was using a OnePlus 6 and the physical finger print reader started to age - it would often fail to unlock. Not here. The unlock is consistent and fast.
- Battery and Charging is a pleasant experience. To see phone getting charged in around 15 mins from 10% was a new experience.
- Call quality : Till now never had an issue and this is a biggest positive for me so far. Call over wifi is great.
- WiFi connectivity : Works like a charm and connectivity doesn't get lost even when the signal is poor. This is a delightful experience since I take lot of zoom calls on my phone.
- Love the haptic feedback.
- Camera : I have been very happy with my OnePlus 6 cameras and I had seen lot of review/comparison of the cameras of IQOO 9PRO. Again this was an area of doubt for me and till now I am pleased with the choice. The camera system has some issues with focus in close distance which is disturbing but other than that it's good enough for my occasional photography. Watch out for some wiered colour in the low light captures (may be over sharpening) but good thing is I didn't need night mode.

Cons:
A smart phone isn't smart enough if it fails to address daily usage requirement by providing a complete experience and in that aspect there noticable short comings (and my mind will not stop comparing with OnePlus 6).
- OS Experience : It is good and has many customisations but the ease of use factor is missing. Example : You swipe down from middle of the screen hoping the notification tray to open but it opens a search and it was not apparent how to change this. It's such a messy experience, specially with a big screen like this!
Or you can search the sound profile to customise it for different situations but God knows where it's hidden.
- Screen : 120Hz is great experience for someone like me, coming from 60Hz but colour profile was not pleasing. I had to alter few settings to get it to my liking. For flagship screen, this was a letdown.
- Audio jack missing : This is touted as a gaming friendly phone and there no IP certification as far as I know, then why remove the 3.5 mm jack? Please note the provided type-C to 3.5mm connector works like a charm.
- Gets warm when I use it with Android auto for driving, not sure if this will go away later.
Verdict : I got a sweet deal with exchange of my old phone and using an SBI card togather. For the 48k that I finally paid for this phone, I am pleased with my purchase so far.
25/03 : The small ui glitches are everywhere! So much so that now I am feeling stupid to not have gone with a more reputed brand! Ex - message app : Pinning a message won't work, grouping doesn't work consistently. Settings : there occassions when we do a change and it doesn't get saved at all."
3516,5.0,"Curved Edge, I've been looking for that for a long time with the Specs I look forward. Not all the Spec Expectations are available especially Battery, but a nice weighful Phone with an addictive look to expose and to stare at."
3517,5.0," Disclosure: I have been a Vivo fan and my last phone was Vivo Nex.

It's been 2 days with the phone now. I've updated the phone to the latest firmware and all apps are upto date. I don't use GPS, and almost always my phone is on data and not wifi and background apps are shut off.

1. Battery Drain

- Even after all the above mentioned settings, the battery drain was unbelievably tremoundous. On a simple YouTube video of 144 fps with manual screen brightness in a normally lit room, the battery was draining 2% at the end of 3-4 min YouTube video.

- The main problem was the battery drain when the phone was on standby. As I said, my phone wasn't connected to internet or searching for wifi at standby. I slept at 70% in the night and woke up to a 56% in the morning after 7 hours.

- My phone was at 94% when I started writing this review. Right now it's 90% at the end of 5 minutes writing in below average brightness and default settings of refresh rates and screen resolution.

2. Spontaneous Hanging

Screen recording sample is attached herewith of two instances. First sample shows random disappearance of home screen icons and the app drawer not responding to commands.

The second sample shows YouTube app malfunctioning. This however I believe can be fixed with a firmware update.

3. 'Supposed 120 watt fast charging'

With the settings as mentioned above, my phone took 35 minutes to full charge from 1% to 100% . But my phone didn't heat up, so it's a nice add on. But the claim of 20 mins isn't true, at least for the device that I got.

4. Subpar front camera

I've attached a sample of the front camera trying to record a product I got from Amazon. I'm trying to focus the camera on to the product but it's neither autofocussing not manually focussing.

Upfront, I hated that the autofocus on the secondary camera is bad! I didn't expect this from a device which costs a premium. The skin colour reproduction is very artificial but I like that their automatic beautification of the skin thereby softening all features is less this time. But yet, something needs to be done about the autofocus. I clicked at least 20 times for the lens to focus on me but it failed every single time, so I had to give up.

That being said some of the highlights of the phone are:

- Absolutely stunning display.
- Good stereo speakers
- SP 8 Gen 1 (Unfortunately it's battery drain is real as well)
- The physical aesthetics of the device
- Good quality USB Type c to Type C cable and providing free good quality case and Type C to 3.5 mm jack adapter. In a world of taking away charging adapters from the box, these bundles are a breath of fresh air.
- Great unboxing experience with the premium box.

My summary:

- Average Camera
- Below average battery
- Average UI
- Awesome display
- Awesome processing power
- Awesome aesthetics

IQOO/Vivo, if you are reading this, please fix these problems with the next firmware update."
3518,5.0,"I'm writing a review for the first time for any of my owned smart phones till date. I pre-ordered IQOO 9 Pro on the launch date it-self i.e. 23rd February and got it on 11th March (a long long wait). I would like to point out few positives and negatives about this phone which I've observed till now:

Positives:
1. Screen of the phone is amazing, the minimum and maximum brightness is class leading. It is easily legible in direct sun light and low minimum brightness doesn't strain the eyes in dark room. You won't find a better display (2k resolution, dynamic 1-120hz refresh rate, 1500 nits peak brightness) phone in this price segment.

2. The fingerprint reader of the phone has biggest reading surface area in any phone including all US and Chinese brands. The unlock speed is on-par with latest S22 series. It is a ultrasonic fingerprint reader not the optical one like all other android phone (excluding Samsung top dogs). It works with wet fingers without any issues. If you finger is very dry then it takes more time to unlock the phone.

3. On the camera front, the main (50MP Samsung (S5K)GN5 1/1.57"") and ultrawide (50MP Samsung (S5K)JN1 1/2.76"") camera sensors are class leading. 2.5x optical and front camera usage same (16MP Samsung S5K3P9 1/3.1"") censor which is above average but not class leading. Photos from main and ultrawide are excellent. Contrast, dynamic range, saturation and noise levels of main and ultrawide cameras are flagship grade.

4. IQOO 9 Pro does have an IR blaster, that means you can control your TV, Set-top box and AC using the phone. This feature might not sound very compelling at first but it is very handy specially if you are having faulty remotes with some non-working buttons.

5. Call quality and signal reception is very good. The earpiece sound output is very loud and rich.

6. It has stereo speakers and sound output it very good and loudness is also great. One issue I would like to point out is that, the volume is YouTude application is very low as compared to other apps. If you play YouTube videos on chrome browser then the sound output is loud. This is a software bug specific to YouTube app only and should get resolved in future updates.

7. Build quality and in-hand feel is very premium. The glass sandwich design with curved display looks top class.

8. Charging speed is just insane, plugin the phone and goto shower and by the time you come, it's already 100%.

-Negatives:
1. No official IP rating for a phone costing this much.

2. I couldn't digest why IQOO didn't use USB Type C standard 3.1 or higher so that we can get wired display output from the phone. The IQOO 9 Pro has USB Type C 2.0 standard with does not support wired display output.

3. Telephoto and Front camera hardware could have been better.

4. No bootloader unlock supported that means no rooting and no custom rom.

As the endnote, this phone has some cutting edge hardware which you won't find in any smartphone. I'm impressed with this phone and would buy it again if given the chance."
3519,5.0,"On paper great specs, and look and build quality, but what can I say 9 months since purchase..and still having software stability issues..dint expect that from a flagship...so selling it off and picking up Google pixel even though its lower specs."
3520,5.0,Very Good
3521,5.0,"Review edited after 1 month.

Pros:
- Super fast charging with 120W, which peaks at 101W don't know why.

- SD 8 Gen 1 and LPDDR5 RAM very smooth experience. UFS 3.1 storage.

- Qualcomm Ultrasonic fingerprint scanner. Super fast and secure.

- 2K E5 Amoled with120Hz display. Not LTPO 2.0 as described in website. Smart option takes from 30-120. If it's LTPO 2.0 AMOLED it should at least go as low 1Hz to save battery.

- 4700mah battery. Gives on average 10hrs of screentime without gaming.

- Camera module. 50MP Gimbal main + 50MP 150° ultra wide + 16MP OIS telephoto. I got some good clicks but many saying bad don't know why.

Cons:
- UI/UX worst no regular updates no customization. Rectangle notification icons which manufacturer gives rectangle icons in 2022. Zero customization.

- Charger makes a weird buzzing sound when charging at peak or when display is on during charging. My phone heats up to 40-44°C even with cooling equipment inside the hood while charging.

- Battery drain SD 8 Gen 1 is power hungry chip. Drains lot of battery even phone is idle. Frequently observed 20% power drain over night with no background application. May be a Software update can fix this. But I'm not confident that IQOO / Vivo gives any damn about customers issues.

- Updates very less compared to Oneplus or Samsung. IQOO only gives 2 android upgrades and 3 years security updates, worst for a flagship.

- IQOO or Vivo have zero successful flagships, being their first flagship I should have waited for one plus 10 pro.

- Bug fixes are never received via OTA. They fix one and add many bugs, their updates are very inconsistent and lame.

- No accessories available for this product in market from good brands like Spigen, Rhinosheild etc., not even Vivo or IQOO gives good accessories for their phone. Case in box matches phone but its very loose and slippery. I have contacted IQOO service center for free screen protector as promised but they don't have them in stock.

- The User Experience is worst in this mobile. Not even as refined as MIUI or even Oppo's ColorOS. Lot of bugs while using mobile. Home screen is worst of worst no customization whatsoever. Android 12 is best customizable in History of android, with 12 out of box this is worst OS. FUNTOUCH OS IS THE WORST OS IN THE ANDROID COMMUNITY.

****Humble suggestion better buy Oneplus 10 pro or Motorola Edge 30 pro. If you can double the price Samsung S22 Ultra. Don't purchase and regret buying this mobile.****

*****FINALLY IF IQOO OR VIVO REPRESENTATIVES SEE THIS REVIEW. FIX YOUR OS. DON'T LAUNCH A HALF COOKED PRODUCT AND BOAST ABOUT IT. UNDERSTAND CUSTOMER ISSUES AND TRY TO RESOLVE THEM.*****"
3522,5.0,"Hi All,

I received the fone on 5th of March (Legend 12 gb, 256gb) overall the fone looks good.
I got it with a good deal for this fone after an exchange with old fone and ICICI discount. I can tell one thing that people who are planning to spend some amount and for a people above good users can plan for this fone if they are okay with the OS.
I am facing little bit challenges while using this fone as I was a Motorola user with an almost stock Android user.
But this fone has some good features compare to other fones.
Here are few things I liked and didn't like. But this like and dislike is not a pros and cons. FYI.
Likes:
Has a fast charge and don’t have to worry about battery drain as this fone charges in 20 to 25 mins 100%.
Looks great in hand and if its black this makes still stunning.
Has given 3.5mm jack converter.
Fingerprint scanner is so accurate and unlocks very fast in a wider area.
With the case provided in the box also supports wireless charging after a test I did. I like that option. But the case is smooth and slippery.
The fone supports lots of 5g bands and down the lane this should work.
The camera pics are pretty good as I am not a guy clicks lots of pic’s but its better than my previous Motorola fone. So, I am happy.
Performance is great as 8 Gen1 is very fast and robust.
Dislikes:
The fone is slippery as its curvy. I suggest going for a good back cover as the one provided in the box is slippery and looks odd for guys b’coz its white in color.
Fone is lengthy and cannot operate in one hand. Big guys can handle but average and short hands will have a challenge.
I didn’t like the Funtouch OS as I was Motorola user from ages. This has some apps which cannot be removed and modified. (I must get used to this one).

Will use the fone more and will provide the review in next 3 to 4 months of time.

Thank you All."
3523,4.0,"DO NOT INSTALL tempered glass as the finger print sensor will not work thereafter.
Phone already installed with a screen protector that does the basic job.

The high power charger makes faint hissing noise while charging."
3524,4.0,"Previously I was used S21 Fe 256 gb variant . It was around 58k. I was satisfied but I was missing speedy and snappy performence as we get in flagship phone and also haptics , fast charging also not good. but one UI and service support is amazing in Samsung. My brother is using s21 ultra he is mostly satisfied with that. But he is a lite user. But in that phone also I was noticed performence and optimisation issues after 8 months of usage (especially camera focussing and quality issues after update)and charging speeds also very less. So I was decided to go for out and out performer.
That is the reason I took iqoo 9 pro for 58k.

Now best things about the device....
1. Best indisplay fingerprint scanner in the world right now( Samsung also behind in this)
2. Best 2k Ltpo 2.0 display....diffinetly this is the best in segment (for 58k). Quality is superb and sharp and very bright panel. but not up to Samsung dynamic amoled level. (Even though this display is provided by samsung itself)
3.120w flash charging top up battery in 0 to 100 in 23 mins 30 to 90 in 11 mins.(tested)
4. Snappy super cool performence, flyes through every tasks. (8 gen 1) no over heating issues.
5.8gb ram with 256 gb rom variant. (This is the pro point i feel, other brands giving 8 and 128 gn variant)
6. Good set of cameras ( no gimmics 2 mp macro bla bla etc)
7. Great haptic feedback.
8.excellent build quality.... Feel premium ness in your hand, weight distribution also good.
7. Finally gaming i am a casual gamer....this is the beast in gaming performence. Super snappy and 4d vibration, memc technology is a boon for gamers.
8. Wireless charging and reverse wireless is a cherry on the top. (Because i have wireless charger and galaxy watch 4)

Now it's Cons time:
1. Funtounch is not up to flagship level. Here and there noticing some optimisation issues.
2. Cameras performing well for this price range...but not flagship worthy.( Especially on potrait mode)
3. Stereo speakers are mostly average. (Clear but not loud)
4. Battery giving up to on an avg 5 hours of Sot. ( 2k screen with 120 hz and 8 gen 1 this is acceptable) in s21 Fe with full hd screen I was getting same back up.

Overall I am totally happy with this device...because I was getting what I was want ( speed and flagship performence). Here Iqoo is giving up to date hardware specs for 58k. I was hoping iqoo and Vivo will give updates on time. (By the way I was got 3 updates since bought this mobile)"
3525,5.0,"I wish they had their own operating system. everything else is up to mark
Funtoush OS is irritating a bit"
3526,5.0, Super
3527,5.0," Phone heats for sure with too much use and also while charging it heats, but with cover its bearable when you using the phone without charger.
Battery drain but for a heavy user like my its giving me battery time upto 5 and half.
Trust me i am mostly on my phone, and i have turned on most of things like NFC, different animations, hypatics are on, i play games then brightness is on full, so many other things.
Intially i got jitters but after update, I restarted phone so far it's going smooth.

Now likes.
Charger is superb as of now i have charged it from 24%, it charged super super quick to 100%
I really liked the in hand feel, bit heavy and big in screen size, i really liked it.
Camera seems good to me in night and day, still gonna use more, but it's good.Takes natural photos you just have switch off AI for that, with AI mode on i liked it.
Face lock and security with finger print is really working great, with finger it took time for me as i press at the bottom of the screen because of my habit with previous phone.
Screen is really bright and crisp.
Update is for Feb only, anroid 12 so many other small things to enjoy.
Need proper software updated to fix bugs in customization. Please Iqoo push proper updates.
Going good so far, got it on heavy discount so i really liked it so far."
3528,5.0,"Battery drain so much even when the device is on standby

Edited (after replacement) : battery is fine now but has heat issue while using camera or taking, guess it will be fix after some optimisation update

Anyway great smart phone and for this price range absolutely beast
Pro: Great camera, night mode etc
Super fast charging 100 in 21 min
Great display
And many more
Cons: heat issue while using camera or taking video, playing games etc
Battery capacity could be more like OnePlus 10 pro
Battery backup not upto the mare

Overall performance is good. So go for it"
3529,1.0,"Writing a review after three months of usage. I would feel that either the Xiaomi 12 pro or One plus 10 pro would have the same pros and cons. For this price range should have gone for Apple 13.

Pros:
Good camera
Battery life
Display
Built up quality
Premium look
Cons:
Video quality - If we take video on direct outdoor with direct exposure to sunlight then phone becomes hot and videos wil come shacky and imperfect
Phone has ceramic back and with company provided case, as day passes it becomes yellow due to daily usage. Pleased go for best and branded back case.
Front camera quality is so mediocre, not upto the mark.
One of the major set back is UI"
3530,1.0,Excellent product but price should be little lower.
3531,5.0,"Powerful device but it has some flaws.
Pros:
* The phone is very snappy and fast. You can handle any task in a blink of an eye. Games are better than op 10 pro as it loads games faster than OnePlus.
* The display is just mind blowing and the smart switch feature is fantastic.. the display is bright, crisp, vibrant and we'll saturated.. watching hdr contents is a treat 😋
* The design is just so stunning and something which you would appreciate.
* Charging speed is really good although it takes 25 mins in my case to charge the phone from 1 to 100.
* Camera is again really good i have seen some comparisons and my friend purchased op 10 pro the rear camera is slightly better than op 10 pro and specially the ultrawide mode can really shoot at a great wide angle which looks more realistic than op. Also, the night mode can can really shoot some bright pics.
* It has IR blaster which means you don't have to ask for remote from your dad 😝 you can operate devices like AC, TV without remote.

Cons:
* First of all the UI sucks all the time it's not at all optimised.. sometimes I notice some frame drops while switching apps. Also, it has a lot of bloatwares.
* Battery backup is not good it's a new phone yet, I charge it almost twice a day some times.
* Camera is really great but I think it could have been better.. if I compare this with Vivo x70 pro plus then Vivo being the last year's flagship outperforms iqoo in most of the scenarios. But it's still great. Night mode shots are good but edges ar not sharp but captures good details.
* Speaker quality is not good. It has dual stereo speakers but the quality is not upto the mark..op 10 pro has better speakers.. they gave an update on speaker quality but the speaker loudness is still not good. Even when you use earphones you will get better output on op 10 pro than this. Sound needs to be optimised a lot if iqoo is watching this review then please work on it..

Verdict: you can go for it.. it has flagship specs but only if you can consider these flaws."
3532,5.0,"Switched from OnePlus 8 Pro to iQoo 9 Pro. Expectations were already high and upto an certain extent it does feel satisfactory but also feels some off things which I'll mention in MISSES below.

BONUS - 1.
Display is beyond Excellence and I wish to keep looking@the screen cntnsly. Kept screen at Smart Switch and it goes best Refresh Rate automatically handled as per the screen usage. No Accidental Touches on Curved Screen.
2. Overall Hardware looks pretty decent and attractive but I personally do not go with how it looks outside but how it behaves Inside. Sporty Stripes are just as useless as they are on real BMW vehicle. Asthetic attraction.
3. Connected to my Home wifi which delivers upto 96 MBPS. Tested download speed on phone and it reached 14.8.MBPS highest I have visually witnessed on any device ever.
4. Camera Test Pending.
5. Battery charging at 120 Watt is just Unbelievable to watch. Drained 1st charge at 6%- Plugged in the Fast charger-10 mins into charging and it was 91%. And battery doesn't drain as much as far experienced. Will test Wireless charging in a day or two.

MISSES -
1. IP66+ rating. Spending a lot from pocket and no IP rating is little demeaning.
2. Feels slightly over priced considering the brand is still not built as compared to other pros in the market.(OnePlus,Samsung,Oppo,Xiaomi)
3. Too big and Protruding Camera Panel. Feels like designer was given too much of free space and he built a Brick wall at back of the phone."
3533,4.0,"I wanted to switch to better display from my current Samsung Galaxy A52 due to eye strain and irritation. Hence was looking for display offering 3200 X 1440 resolution display. Saw this phone which offers QHD+ LTPO display and with top notch hardware specs. However was hesitant to pay such a price for the brand which not popular. But as I got good exchange price and some discount, dared to buy this one. After usage for few days, jotting down my observations below

Screen Resolution:
Initial setup itself revealed by my urge of switching to a better display is addressed. The phone presents gorgeous screen which is preventing any eye strain for me. There are 3 color options and I use standard one which is more bright compared to professional mode (which may suit some of the people). Dynamic refresh adjusts automatically as per need.

Audio:
Phone speaker are very good and sounds quite loud. Sound is also well balanced highlighting low and mid more to my liking. Phone offers various customization options to further adjust the audio. Not new compared to Galaxy S series. I however found audio output bit low through bluetooth and wired earphones (I am using Huawei True wireless and Boat wired) earbuds. May be over the year headphones will be loud enough.

Camera:
I typically clicks only 10-12 photos a year and hence this really doesn't matter much to me. However the photos looked great to me but as I am not photography enthusiast, cannot really comment.

Battery:
Easily lasts for more than a day. Additionally when you have 120 W flash charge, there is not worry about battery. It charges in less than 20 Minutes as we generally do not wait till full battery drain

Others:
1) Phone has fantastic eye-catching design and should work well with most.
2) Ultrasonic fingerprint scanner is simply amazing.
3) It seems that the phone has IR blaster as the Smart Remote App (pre-installed) perfectly works with almost all my home appliances.
4) I do not see any issues with Funtouch OS also. It provides required functions easily.

Negatives:
Not much really but I mentioned about low audio on earbuds. Further for such premium phone, IQOO should remove some of unnecessary the pre-installed apps.

Overall a nice purchase. Satisfied after few days of usage."
3534,4.0,my Suggestion is go with IQOO 9 / 9T which is much better than this and prices is also low.
3535,5.0,"Only a few days into using
The pros.
1. Design and looks
2. Top specs
3. Good OS despite other reviews
4. Feature rich camera
5. Display is good
6. 120w flash charging
The Cons.
1. Despite the features camera quality is a mixed bag. At times shoots great low lights pics and at times it's atrocious. 8 k video is nothing great.
2. Battery consumption is fairly high.
Heavy usage of phone means it won't last beyond 6-7 hours. Regular ~ 12. Low usage probably 20 hours
3. Fingerprint reader requires me to press my finger quite hard to detect. It's a pain.
Overall a good phone
But the camera needs to be consistent"
3536,5.0,"Don't consider those negative reviews. This mobile is awesome. If you are coming from low end or mid range Device this mobile will surprise you.

Display - 9/10
Camera - 9/10
Battery-7/10 (discharge is happening slightly fast but can be improved when it's getting update)
Charging -9/10 ( heats up Little bit) , ( full charge in 20mins)
Gaming - 9/10 (heating only in ultra HD graphics)
UI - 8/10 ( I'm coming from pixel experience so trust me this UI is really awesome when you are from other UI full of bloatware and irritating things, some minor bugs are there but can be removed by updating)
Speaker - 10/10 ( impressive speaker, louder and very good clarity) (even half the volume it over takes my realme 4k TVs volume 😂)
Call quality - 9/10
Multimedia - 10/10 ( if you are watching movies and series all the time just go for it)

Don't forget to maintain your battery health, charge only 1 or 2 times in a day and maintain 20-90% always."
3537,5.0,"Hardware of the mobile is pretty good. Fast charging, Responses and finger print are quite good.

But after using two months my opinion is changed.

# Design and Body of mobile 📲 5*/5.

# Edge Display 📱 5*/5

# 🔊 Speaker 🔊 5*/5 out put quality is very clarity.

# Call Quality 5*/5

# Camera 📸/🤳 5*/5 both Especially back cam Portrait nailed it.

#Finger Print top in it's kind super fast.(before applying matte tampered glass make sure it will work for finger 🤞 print perfectly or not.
In my case my matte tampered glass not allowed finger print scanner.)

#Face unlock 🔓 excellent.

# Wireless Charging 5*/5 Unbelievable fast.

# The best part is u will get type-C to 3.5mm Jack in box 🎁

# Last but not least Charging speed 8Mins to 50% 18 Mins to 100%.
(After 8 months i noticed if i charge with laptop it gives very good backup than vooc 120w)

# Battery 🔋🔋 BackUp also excellent 👌👍 for moderate user it will gives 1.5 days for minimal usages.

(If you want to achieve fast charging,
disable wifi, Bluetooth, gps and connect mobile to charger. Don't use at all while charging. Mobile data is not a problem).

I'm in Hyderabad I'm ising airtel 5G without any problem.
Recently I got 13 update as well few improvements are there extra smooth UI.

( My personal suggestion connect charger when battery is 22%-25%. Remove when it reaches 93%-96% don't connect upto 100%. If you follow my tips your battery life will improve a lot )

I brought mobile for 48K only.
after ICICI & Old mobile exchange.

Initially I'm wrong about mobile now Im Happy.

Mobile really worth it.

(4.8 bcz Mobile after 13 update no heat while charging)

Not a water Resistant but Splash , Dust Proof.
Need to Improve some more features.)"
3539,1.0,"Hardware of the phone, without doubt is top notch. The finger print reader especially works like a charm. The 120W charging and 4700 mah battery back up are the wndt highlights, too good. Coming to the performance it's very good from the hardware side. Camera is very good too. Software side needs fixes. Funtouch is fun but not very reliable at times; negligible glitches here and there which can be corrected through software upgrades.

Overall worth it. I exchanged my OnePlus 6T for 11800 alo with 6000 Cashback on credit card. Actual price: 64+K; Post exchange and Cashback: 45K."
3540,1.0,"I bought this device twice as the 1st device I received having faulty battery. Sadly I didn't get a replacement but I recived refund so I have to order again.
It provides an average battery back up like 5 hrs on continuous screen on time aslo it keep dropibg battery level quickly while daily uses like call or messaging. it Drops exact 20% battery for bgmi in every hour. Sometime it took more than usual time to fully charged like 25-28 minutes. Game lags if you make the screen recorder on for 15 minutes. Display and bulid quality are most powerful and provides awesome performance at outside.I dropped this device twice but no damages without screen guard as Curve screen has to come with U V ray glass and the finger sensor won't work , so have to use with screen guard.
Overally premium phone in display and build quality but not recommended in this price range as they could have optimised the device more for stable perfomance."
3541,5.0, If i talk about the shape it has nice look and design. Slightly slippery when i hold but its manageable. The phone was 28% charged when i booted it i did all the formalities setting up the device and all. I also got an system update and i downloaded it. The phone went warm while the things were going on and i also noticed frame drops when i updated my phone but it is normal because the phone was warm and it was just updated. One thing i was confused about was battery. It gave me 30 minutes of backup i guess.... when i did all the things. And i think its good because i did alot of things updating the phone checking all the apps and all stuff you do on your new phone. These were my first impressions and overall it was a good experience 4 stars from my side. I only wrote the problems i faced and the things i didn't write about are top notch. This phone is amazing you can go for it.
3542,5.0, Camera & battery all are nice superb phone
3543,4.0,"Cons:

1. THIS IS THE MAIN ISSUE. Fix your OS. too buggy. and all the unwanted pre-installed software is useless.

2. please dont buy this phone for camera quality. my 3 yo asus 6z can take better pics in multiple situations. the camera is so slow to click a picture I can go get a cup of coffee and its still asking me to hold it steady to take the pic and is still loading. this needs to be fixed ASAP. if you cant fix this issue dont market it as gimbel camera. because that makes almost no difference. every customer always wants a point and shoot camera which can click pictures faster. this is a mobile phone and not a professional camera

3. some apps are incompatible but this is a little rare
4. could have had a headphone jack but oh well. everyone wants to follow apple. take out headphone jack. Hey atleast 120W charger comes with the box be happy

Pros:
1. charging speed. dont mind people complaining about charging speed. this phone charges in 20 minutes if you leave the phone alone and do something else. this is not advertised as a gaming phone that charges in 20 minutes on the go.
2. screen
3. decent battery life. people complaining about battery life, reduce the resolution and refresh rate. no phone can give you more than 3-4 hours screen on time with 1440p 120hz
4. speakers"
3544,4.0,"prons
1 superb display and fingerprint reader
2 super camera quality
3 good looking
4 fast charging

cons
1 battery drains faster.. even in stand by mode which losses 1 persent in every 8 min.. if we unplug after full charge at morning 9 battery becomes empty at evening 7.. if we use camera, by evening 4 ith will die..
2 heating while using camera.. video recording gets jerky in a lengthy recording.
3 software is average.. animations are not smooth
4 not optimised.. it have 8 gen 1 but we are not getting it's actual power..
5 not optimised we have ltpo 2 display but refresh rate shifting is not in professional manner..

verdict..
best hardware with least optimisation with weakest battery.. but a price of 59000 including offers its worthy"
3545,5.0,"This is my conclusion of 6 days of usage.
Like - charging speed (16-20minutes), Display (best one for me yet), fingerprint reader (3d sonic scanner really good but still not as fast as built in body scanner), camera (good overall)
Dislike - bloatware (absolutely hate and the sole reason of not recommending this), idle power consumption (battery drains even if you are not doing anything), NO HEADPHONE JACK (there is a dongle in the box but why not give it in the body), Average speakers (good but could have been a little bit louder)

Lastly I would only say in conclusion that if you are buying this for the sole purpose of gaming then there are better options than to buy this. I had bought this as a daily overall good phone to use but so far it has been only good for gaming. YouTube watching hours are good too. The absolutely reason for not recommending this is 'the bloatware are permanent'. Most of them. If anyone finds a way to uninstall them then please. I'll be really thankful. And the phone does heatup while charging although nothing alarming. I would to wait for the time it charges and do something else for the time it charges. I played bgmi classic matches for approx 5 hours. This is my first iqoo phone and I seriously didn't like the overall experience."
3546,5.0,"I've been using the device for over 3 months now, Obviously when you pay this amount for the phone is not going to be crap but its no where near perfect. I bought it because of 8gen1 but now regret because of it . Lol be careful what you wish for."
3547,5.0,"Super performance
Great and beautiful display
Excellent camera
Battery performance is good
Finger sensor is excellent

Overall an excellent experience with this beautiful 😍 smartphone."
3548,5.0," I know we can't judge the whole brand by this 1. But trust me it has so many defects, over-heating feels like a hot metal in your pocket (just record 2-3 4k videos), no hardware quality in camera module, OIS motor goes round and round (check the attached video from 00:18 secs) etc.. Plz Don't buy to support the new brand with good specs which i did, with especially low grade scam premium service like IQOO center, they themselves says heating is common on IQOO products if we use camera or watch more videos which i didn't see on other metal devices like OnePlus and Xiaomi. I got these issues with in first use of 3-4 hrs after full charge. Unfortunately, i was out of station and couldn't return product in time like 1 day.. even if the seller can give me a refund with a cut of 5k, i would happily take the deal.
So called premium service centers couldn't help you with anything. They themselves will not have stock will take easily 10-15 days but we can find it on ecommerce sites, that's how pathetic IQOO is organized. they couldn't reach out to HOs and speak. They will be there only to pass info as a proxy, they are of no use. Even they don't bother to call you rather they expect us to call and know about the status, and it seems they don't have time to listen to us and says they had work which i don't know what a service center guy does other than supporting the customer :( , that's how premium is the service of IQOO. i had seen a weird policy of replacement, they doesn't replace the whole box, they only take the handset from the new box and replace the old one with the new cable etc.. and send it back to factory. Most probably I got one of these kind of defect pieces.. Don't at all trust the word premium service, it's all scam and i can write pages but lastly i would say don't go for IQOO product-wise and escpecially service wise. Thank You IQOO..

Update 1: mobile is been more than 2 weeks like 17 days at the premium service center.. no mobile replacement done.. even after 1 month purchase, no mobile at my hand. So don't buy IQOO phones, their service is the worst. I think they are launching some other phones Z6 pro etc.. don't fall in their trap.

Update 2: Just got an update it will take again a week to get my mobile. Thank You #IQuestOnAndOn4MyMobile (IQOO)

Update 3: Just i called the service center guys for 100 times got the status, saying mobile got delayed due to saturdays and sundays. #IQuestOnAndOn4MyMobile (IQOO)"
3549,1.0,"I have been using phone for a while , phone is fully loaded with features and feels premium with super fast charging to 100% within 15-20 min , only problem is it's battery life as it drains quickly, which is a very big negative point for such an expensive smartphone."
3550,1.0,"Things which are cons
1) Battery stand by time
2) Missing of important feature like IP 68
3) Average night mode photos/Videos (Nightography)
4) Some basic features missing like decrease ringtone volume itself automatically after picking up phone etc.
5) Average Audio level over the speakers
6) Non availability of extra Charger online
6) Low quality of accesories exept rubber silicon back cover

Pro's
1) Superb Look & comfortable feel like real flagship phone
2) Not so much expensive compared with Samsung Smartphone (S,-22 Series)
3) Initial Discount offer while purchasing
4) Smart Vivo service support
5) Steardy & Solid build quality (Drop test successfully protect)
6) Rear Main Camera lenses has extra protective ring housing bump"
3551,5.0,"I've been a OnePlus user for the past 6 years. Decided to take a leap of faith with the purchase of 9pro. I've been using it for the past 2 weeks and I'm very happy with the purchase.

The phone is built well and the design is impressive. You won't mistake it for any other phone. it feels premium to hold and the camera bump actually makes the large phone easier to hold. Buttons are clicky and well built but I do miss the alert slider.

The screen is top notch. Great colours and brightness, super responsive. I've set it to 120hz permanently. Speakers are excellent. Good to watch your fav shows without a headset. The cameras are great too. The IR blaster is a welcome feature, means you don't have to keep searching for any remotes.

My main concern was the OS. Coming from oxygen OS I had my fair share of doubts about Funtouch OS. Some features are not as easy to access as in colorOS but other than that the UI has really grown on me. Funtouch OS has come a long way but oxygen OS still has the edge here.

120watts charging is a life saver. the phone always tops up to 100% within minutes. Battery life is however average and can barely make thru a day.

I've found some random bugs here and there such as the playstore being a bit jittery and whatsapp cam not able to take photos. Hopefully it gets ironed out in software updates.

I've seen some comments where some people have received faulty screen, heating issues etc. So far I've not faced any such problems."
3552,5.0,"I ain't a heavy gamer. I play 8 ball pool, cricket n ludo :p . And For normal day to day regular use, It is not heating up at all. UI is super smooth.

Decent battery life. Good thing is its getting fully charged in less than 15-20minutes.

No lags nothing. Huge curved display. Super fast ui. So yeah till now its going great for me. Cheers!"
3553,4.0,"Review updated after 1 and half month

3554,4.0,"I am using this phone from 2 days.. Mobile was very good,smooth, Performance was good and best part is charging,finger print
1.Os level I didn't felt any difference as I am using vivo before ,Some Android 12 features are missing(Colour Palette) and more shortcuts, personalizations should be added
2.Wide angle and potrait photos should be improved through software updates
3.Camera Features are more in IQOO9 than Pro like long exposure,super night video, documents etc...Little disappointed
4.IP68 rating was missing at this point (If this is included best all-rounder phone in 2022)
5.HDR Certificate is not available for Netflix when mobile has supported hardware
6.Privacy toggle shortcuts, other toggle shortcut,Drive mode , 3 Types of dark mode should be added"

3556,5.0,"After using 2 month my honest review.

Pros:-
1. Nice display
2. Superb finger print censor.
3. Curved design
4. Camera
5. Charging speed

Cons:-
1. DisCharging speed is as fast as charging.
2. Complete unfit phone to use in India in summer.
3. Super heating issue. During charging, during WhatsApp call, during normal call, video call you can say anything & yes it heating everytime.
4. If you are a gamer , boss don't go with adds ,it's unable to balance heat with WhatsApp. Don't know if company is working on it or not.
5. Minor ui glitch( which is fine & gradually will be fixed, not a big deal)

Overall feedback:- if you are worried for old phone that is getting heat. They avoid this phone. I switched from OnePlus 6 due to heating issue. I feel sorry for me. Look wise & add wise it's flagship. That's all"
3557,5.0,"Great performance , screen and camera"
3558,5.0,"I see many reviews complaining about the phone and I do not understand why? It's not like we live in 40's or 60's. Consumers had enough reviews to read and watch before buying the phone. You knew exactly what you were buying.

Anyways, I wanted two things on my phone fast charging and big screen. Iqoo 9 pro satisfied my requirement and it hasn't disappointed me. Watching videos on YouTube and movies or TV series on Netflix or Hotstar is fun.

People will argue why buy a phone which provides only two years of major Android upgrades and three years of security updates for Rs. 69,990. Let's be honest after a year or two better phones will be available. Also, I won't be using the same phone for more than 2-3 years. I think many people are on the same boat.

I was considering Samsung Galaxy s22 models but it charges so slow and Realme gt 2 pro the signature of whoever that guy is turned me off. I don't want any signature on my phone even if it's of a very famous person. I don't want it. People gonna say why not OnePlus 10 pro. No thanks, I don't want a phone whose camera setup looks like my 4 stove burner. So, IQ00 9 PRO was the PERFECT phone for me."
3559,1.0,"I taken for 90fps gameplay but it has only 60fps, other than device very good for other options but for gaming I'm not expect this much value phone having only 60fps, nw a days only 12k getting 60fps y we should invest this much for 60fps , BGMI as to reply for this."

3564,5.0,Better than apple 14 pro in all aspect
3565,5.0,"The design improvement is a big step forward. Had the Fold 2 before this and the tall thin top screen is replaced by this which feels more like the front of a regular smartphone. The camera is amazing. Also 2 physical Sims and an esim (though is either Sim2 or eSIM at a time) is a huge bonus. There is also a nice task bar at the bottom to switch between apps. The only down side .... these Folds depreciate too fast. The price at which I had to sell my old one made me cry. Oh yes, no cover on this beauty."

3568,5.0,"For its starting price of ₹ 1,55,000, the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4 is expensive, but regardless, it's still arguably the most incredible smartphone for tech enthusiasts and Android power users, to date.
With its many empowering multitasking features, stylus support, big and beautiful folding display, and respectable battery life, the Z Fold 4 can not only be a phone in your pocket and a tablet in your hands, but even your PC replacement."
3569,5.0,"Only if they had provided 25Watt PD adapter with this costly mobile. I had to buy that separately.
The premium you are paying is for the new technology and for uniqueness.
This is for someone who do multitasking a lot or he/she is a tech savvy person. Otherwise you can go for S22 Ultra."

The camera is amazing. Also 2 physical Sims and an esim (though is either Sim2 or eSIM at a time) is a huge bonus. There is also a nice task bar at the bottom to switch between apps. The only down side .... these Folds depreciate too fast. The price at which I had to sell my old one made me cry. Oh yes, no cover on this beauty."

3618,4.0,"For its starting price of ₹ 1,55,000, the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4 is expensive, but regardless, it's still arguably the most incredible smartphone for tech enthusiasts and Android power users, to date.

3660,5.0,Superb smartphone by Samsung . Fold 4 is unique in smartphone. Camera quality is good. Little bit expensive for this
3661,5.0,"Liked - Top notch display, gorgeous display, heavyly and seriously powerful device thanks to 8+ gen 1. Tremendous battery life in heavy usage. Super cool device. Silky buttery experience with blazing fast performance. good sound quality. The form factor is really good. I mean the screen is flat, so it feels like a wide(not actually wide but feels like) phone also it is tall, that's why it really feels good at hand. I have an iPad but all the work now can be done by phone so I am happy.

Didn't like it - As I had op5t i loved oxygen os, but now it feels like realme UI. Camera is worst for this price. Main sensor is good other two are useless. Company should provide a telephoto lens in this price range. I had op5t and previously op3t,both camera were good. Op10t camera is exactly same as nord 2t.

Conclusion - if you looking for speed, performance, battery life, longevity, best of display, premium feel then go for it.

If you are looking for OP experience like an alert slider, or a good camera then please don't choose this. Either u can wait for the next OP or go for other devices. if you don't bother about UI experience(i.e. oxygen) then go for iqoo9t(its far better in spec)

go to gsmarena compare op10r and op10t. exactly same specification except processor and charging speed(this much fast charge is not required by excluding important spec) ."
3662,4.0,"So , basically I am reviewing it after usage of 1 month and 2 days. I am giving it 4 star because of Alert slider missing. Let's me clear it by points.

1. Battery is awesome. It will get full charge in 19 minutes 20 seconds. It lasts more than 25 hours to me.

2. Camera quality is nice. Specially night mode is awesome. Some improvements should be done for selfie camera but it clicks nice picture.

3. No lagging , no hang. It runs smoothly and very fast.

4. Only thing that disappoints is alert slider that is missing in this phone.

5. Video quality is awesome while you record and it is stable.

6. While watching any OTT , streaming quality is awesome. You can fully enjoy it .

7. Speaker of phone is perfect, even at lowest volume you can clearly hear the voice on call."
3663,4.0,"Pros:
1.Mind-blowing charging speed, by the time you taken shower, your phone will be ready.
2. Powerfull chipset, no heating while playing CoD
3.Nice display, colors are punchy
Cons:
1. For the price, camera is the worst. On paper it's having 50Mp sensor. But You can't use it with pro mode or zoom. Idealy it's 12 mp sensor which you can do zoom or use in pro mode.
2. Not satisfied with the finger print sensor. Frequently landing on multiple attempt.
3. No wireless charging or IP rating or alert slider. they should have given atleast anyone of it.
4 faced network issue with Wi-Fi after update it's better
5. While unlocking, phone will hang for couple of seconds. This only happenz after Android 13 beta update. Hope it will not be a issue with stable version
If you are looking for a phone without much on camera definitely a pick. But camera is the villan."
3664,4.0,"Purchased it some days ago !!

Switched from my Asus so I had really high expectations and well, it did perform somewhat close to it but also many downgrades as well, I'm just gonna list as pros and cons !

Pros :
- I mean snapdragon 8+ Gen 1, you can expect amazing performance, why not top tier since it's the best processor android could offer? Well cause I feel the processor on this one is under clocked to reduce heating but it's holding up pretty good in terms of gaming and other benchmark tests and stuff.

- Build Quality is actually good, Especially the back, the back does feel amazing and while holding it does feel like a premium phone, expect for the frame ofc, it's made of polycarbonate but we can get a hang to it later.

- Software, I'm not gonna sit around and cry about their merging with oppo, I feel it's fast and a good ui, of course some old features not available now since I've used a OnePlus 5 in the past for some weeks but we can get a hang to this new oxygen os, just hope it's not completely turned to color os.

- Charging is just insanity on this one, switching from a phone which used to take around 2 hours to get fully charged to this one, almost finishing full charge under 20 minutes and I've witnessed it several times, it's just impressive but some issues and I'll talk about it in cons.

- Networking and connecting is fast and good! Haven't faced any major issues in my networking experiences! calling is a good experience, connecting with networks and bluetooth is extremely fast, good overall.

Cons :

- about the processor, like I said it is under clocked and the benchmark scores proved it a bit, although I don't care about benchmark scores and just want to keep my belief in real life usage so it is doing good.

- Polycarbonate frame and No alert slider? Like really? at least we deserved a metal frame at this price segment which is what upset me a bit, not really a big fan of alert slider so I didn't mind that part.

- the camera setup is so so so average and stupid, aside from the main lens, the wide and macro just did not make sense at all and are completely worthless in this segment, this is literally the same setup from Nord 2T but just a better software optimisation, front camera is alright too, nothing that great

- Charging indeed is one of the key factors in this phone but it takes a toll on the battery backup, usually in my usage I have to charge it 2 times for it to be used the whole day, it drains a bit more than I expected it to, also there's no option available to disable 150W charging to let it charge in usual speed to test the battery, only except for the night optimisation mode, which is kind of good in my opinion.

Phone is a good segment in this price range and If you do believe in the particular brand image and it's products then go for it. Although Iqoo 9T does provide a better camera setup with a bit more aggressive processor performance, but this device does the job too."
3665,3.0,"So here I am writing my review after having used this device for over two weeks.
Pros-

1. Processor- Processor is a beast. This latest Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 is so optimized that you're never gonna lag behind.

2. Battery life- Usually phones that have fast charging, their battery drains really fast but I dont know how oneplus has managed to ace in this department. It has a 160watt supervooc fast charger and charges the device withing 20 mins. And once you've charged the device completely it provides you enough juice for More than a day.

3. OS- I was totally disappointed when I heard that oppo has merged the OXygen os with color os, because Oxygen os had stock android like feeling. But believe me guys this new os is not that bad either. It has features of both the UIs and its super snappy.

4. Mutitasking- you dont have to worry about that department either because of the beast processor this phone is equipped with.

5- Build Quality- Build quality is okay since it has a plastic frame. Both sides are equipped with glass pannel. The in hand feel is good. It looks premium. And the Alert slider (those who know, know) is missing but you'll get used to it. My previous oneplus's aler slider got damaged just after 2 months of purchasing.

Cons-

1. Camera- Camera Sucks big time. Dont know what was their logic of 50 + 16 + 2 combination. Its a flagship device and I dont know why they din provice Hassleblad Cameras. 2 MP microscope lens is good for nothing useless.

2. Freezes- Although the UI is super snappy but it still freezes quite often. And what I do is press and hold the Power and Volume Up Button and it restarts the device. But its still annoying."
3666,4.0,"A rare combination of high-end specs delivering a stunning performance using a greatly optimized OS. I was not expecting such a blistering performance from an Android device. Although there are few compromises on the hardware front such as removal of alert slider button, it's certainly not a deal breaker. The design of the phone is not pathbreaking, but actually could differentiate from other me-too phones. The unique camera setup helps to differentiate this phone with others. It's a kind of proprietary design for One Plus 10 series. The photos come good if not excellent. I could buy it at 36k with ICICI bank CC offer, combined with an exchange. At 36k it's a steal for sure. If you are looking for a real fast phone, has a decent 6.7 inch-120 Hz screen, a unique look to flaunt, One Plus 10T presents itself as a worthy option to consider."
3667,4.0,Recieved a defective piece got it returned but to travel to service centre and get it returned has been hectic. The money I saved in discounts and festive offer most of it gone in travelling to service centre again and again. The exchange of the product for a replacement teh service centre people behave as they have fought a war to get the replacement. Would recommend one plus 10 pro for better camera or apple product
3668,4.0,">screen is good.
>main camera is good, rest 2 lenses are poor.
>Phone battery lasts for 12 hours according to my usage so no complain .
>Has Dolby for music output which many phones don't have.
>Theres no heating issue or lag.
>Call recorder has voice alert while recording.
>Phone gets charged very fast (apple fanboys can only dream about it).
>Overall a perfect phone with least issues under 50k....do miss old oxygen OS but will get used to with new os as well ."
3669,4.0,"I have Pixel 7. Yesterday I purchased this 8GB/128 GB varient.

Cons : Average selfie camera post day light.
Back camera and processing is also ok only.

Pros where it beats Pixel 7/Pro :

1) Fluidity, Performance in apps, multi tasking where you constantly switch open 5-10 apps throughout the day.
No one closes apps after introduction of gesture navigation.

None of apps are gaming apps.

2) No warming with 5G, wifi, 70-80% brightness.

3) Speakers Sound Quality and loudness.

4) Battery- Pixel barely manages 4:30-5:00 Hrs.
OnePlus 10T, easily goes 7:30-8:00 Hrs. Screen on time, with all AOD, haptics, location, Bluetooth etc on.

5) Charging: Pixel takes 1:30 Hrs, OnePlus took 19-20 mins from 0 to 100.

6) Haptics- Both are equal in everyday usage.

Summary: In 45-50K, this is best value for money as well as performance oriented device to buy for. Not just in gaming, but in all apps, it shows its power."

3691,4.0,Look like premium. Phone is so cool and charging 10 - 15 min full charge. But battery drain fast. If u use game internet max 5-6 hours.
3692,4.0,"Phone build - the phone feels premium at hand. It feels awesome. The case that comes in box feels cheap(but atleast we get a case) don't forget to order a case with phone.

Screen - the screen is just awesome. No bugs no lags during scrolling. As a heavy user and gamer I had an awesome experience with it. The screen quality and display are just wow.

Charging - the best part of the phone. In the times where all other phones are removing chargers. Oneplus 10t comes with a massive 150Watt charging brick. Its just the fastest charging I have seen. The phone goes 0 to 100 in 20 mins sharp. Constant performance, every single time. I am getting 5 percent per minute charging speed.

Battery life- the battery life is long. It can last 9 10 hours screen time. I have never felt battery drains and its fast charging never lets you down.

Processing and heating - I never felt any lags in phone or game. The phone is just buttery smooth. I didn't feel any heating issues even during 150 watt fast charging.

Camera-I am not a camera guy, but still I took few pics. The cameras are ok. Not the best in segment according to other reviews but I don't have camera expertise to speak up. For me the camera was same as any other. Pics quality were good, that's enough for most.

Overall at this price point-this is the best phone you can get. With oneplus brand name and all the latest value. I love the fact that I can just use the phone out of the box. There's case there's charger. Everything is present. I have exchanged my older oneplus so I just had to put my Sim in, put the case and started using it.
The most underrated phone I would say♥️"
3693,5.0,"It's good mobile,if you normal working guy not a chapri tik tokker and want higher specs phone which can run apps smoothly without draining much of battery.
Go for it
I got it for 36k after exchange and ICICi card offer"
3694,4.0,After week use...It is okay but too much price...Bought for gaming but looks like IQOO 7 12 gb ram is far better compared to Oneplus as there is too much frame drop. Other than that interface and multiple apps usgae has no issues. camera is average..
3695,5.0,"Good Phone, The Only Issue I am Facing is Just Battery Life, It's Not upto my Expectations. Otherwise it's a Golden Phone."
3696,5.0,"Good battery backup and camera is good.. slow motion and night mode is excellent

3697,4.0,Not that much good .. but ok
3698,4.0,"Phone is very good. Great display, crazy fast processor and oxygen OS is smoooth.. charging is really quick and battery lasts for really long time. Only issue I feel is that the vibration feedback for calls and notifications are weak in comparison to my Galaxy S10"
3699,5.0,This Mobil is good
3700,4.0,Mobile is heating during the charging
3701,5.0,Good performance and better deal.
3702,4.0,Good phone overall.. Quick Delivery On time..
3703,4.0,"Really superfast charging
It also drains somewhat quickly. So those who have heavy usage and don't want to charge a second time may wait for the gen 2 processor as I read that the battery drain issue is due to the processor. The charger is also somewhat bulky.
Camera is pretty good though I am no photo enthusiast.
Display is great
Weight, build, grip are good.
Fingerprint could have been better.
The case given by the company is really very cheap and looks like made from repeatedly recycled plastic.
Bought at a net price of 39.5k after discount of bank offer of 5k and exchange of two year old redmi note 9 pro max for 10.5k.
I feel sorry for the customers who got defective pieces but that is how it would have been even if we bought from a shop. However Amazon customer service is deteriorating possibly because of government policies and abuse of return policy by many of the customers.
Except battery issue and the cheap case, I feel it is a value for money product."
3704,4.0,Bought this phone for camera and battery but they're not upto the expectations. Rest are good enough for this price range
3705,4.0,"Super fast charging - 5 to 100% goes in 20-25 mins.
Battery life - Good battery for heavy users
Camera - Not much impressed. Samsung and iPhone have better cameras
Finger print scanner - lightning fast
Display - Excellent display
Speaker - good dual speakers

All in all good for daily users, gamers. Not great for people who love clicking high quality photos. Fast Charging is life saver."
3706,4.0,Could have been much better given the price tag. User interface is complicated. I have been using I Phone since 2007 as I was in Singapore & London. I also used Samsung Galaxy S21 5 G Ultra which is a fantastic phone. I purchased this one for my wife. Look wise fine. Camera is very good. User interface could have been much better. They tried to copy I Phone but then I Phones are I Phones.
3707,4.0,"Main Camera is Good, clicks natural photos. Ultrawide is crap. Selfie is okish. Performance is KILLER. Display is GOOD. Battery is better than average. Charging is mind blowing."
3708,4.0,"I purchased 16GB variant. I am very happy with this product.

Battery charring speed is excellent.

Phone operating speed is amazing.
Overall, this is very good phone."
3709,4.0,"Liked - Top notch display, gorgeous display, heavyly and seriously powerful device thanks to 8+ gen 1. Tremendous battery life in heavy usage. Super cool device. Silky buttery experience with blazing fast performance. good sound quality. The form factor is really good. I mean the screen is flat, so it feels like a wide(not actually wide but feels like) phone also it is tall, that's why it really feels good at hand. I have an iPad but all the work now can be done by phone so I am happy.

Didn't like it - As I had op5t i loved oxygen os, but now it feels like realme UI. Camera is worst for this price. Main sensor is good other two are useless. Company should provide a telephoto lens in this price range. I had op5t and previously op3t,both camera were good. Op10t camera is exactly same as nord 2t.

Conclusion - if you looking for speed, performance, battery life, longevity, best of display, premium feel then go for it.

If you are looking for OP experience like an alert slider, or a good camera then please don't choose this. Either u can wait for the next OP or go for other devices. if you don't bother about UI experience(i.e. oxygen) then go for iqoo9t(its far better in spec)

go to gsmarena compare op10r and op10t. exactly same specification except processor and charging speed(this much fast charge is not required by excluding important spec) ."
3710,5.0,"So , basically I am reviewing it after usage of 1 month and 2 days. I am giving it 4 star because of Alert slider missing. Let's me clear it by points.

1. Battery is awesome. It will get full charge in 19 minutes 20 seconds. It lasts more than 25 hours to me.

2. Camera quality is nice. Specially night mode is awesome. Some improvements should be done for selfie camera but it clicks nice picture.

3. No lagging , no hang. It runs smoothly and very fast.

4. Only thing that disappoints is alert slider that is missing in this phone.

5. Video quality is awesome while you record and it is stable.

6. While watching any OTT , streaming quality is awesome. You can fully enjoy it .

7. Speaker of phone is perfect, even at lowest volume you can clearly hear the voice on call."
3711,5.0,"Pros:
1.Mind-blowing charging speed, by the time you taken shower, your phone will be ready.
2. Powerfull chipset, no heating while playing CoD
3.Nice display, colors are punchy
Cons:
1. For the price, camera is the worst. On paper it's having 50Mp sensor. But You can't use it with pro mode or zoom. Idealy it's 12 mp sensor which you can do zoom or use in pro mode.
2. Not satisfied with the finger print sensor. Frequently landing on multiple attempt.
3. No wireless charging or IP rating or alert slider. they should have given atleast anyone of it.
4 faced network issue with Wi-Fi after update it's better
5. While unlocking, phone will hang for couple of seconds. This only happenz after Android 13 beta update. Hope it will not be a issue with stable version
If you are looking for a phone without much on camera definitely a pick. But camera is the villan."
3712,5.0,"Purchased it some days ago !!

Switched from my Asus so I had really high expectations and well, it did perform somewhat close to it but also many downgrades as well, I'm just gonna list as pros and cons !

Pros :
- I mean snapdragon 8+ Gen 1, you can expect amazing performance, why not top tier since it's the best processor android could offer? Well cause I feel the processor on this one is under clocked to reduce heating but it's holding up pretty good in terms of gaming and other benchmark tests and stuff.

- Build Quality is actually good, Especially the back, the back does feel amazing and while holding it does feel like a premium phone, expect for the frame ofc, it's made of polycarbonate but we can get a hang to it later.

- Software, I'm not gonna sit around and cry about their merging with oppo, I feel it's fast and a good ui, of course some old features not available now since I've used a OnePlus 5 in the past for some weeks but we can get a hang to this new oxygen os, just hope it's not completely turned to color os.

- Charging is just insanity on this one, switching from a phone which used to take around 2 hours to get fully charged to this one, almost finishing full charge under 20 minutes and I've witnessed it several times, it's just impressive but some issues and I'll talk about it in cons.

- Networking and connecting is fast and good! Haven't faced any major issues in my networking experiences! calling is a good experience, connecting with networks and bluetooth is extremely fast, good overall.

Cons :

- about the processor, like I said it is under clocked and the benchmark scores proved it a bit, although I don't care about benchmark scores and just want to keep my belief in real life usage so it is doing good.

- Polycarbonate frame and No alert slider? Like really? at least we deserved a metal frame at this price segment which is what upset me a bit, not really a big fan of alert slider so I didn't mind that part.

- the camera setup is so so so average and stupid, aside from the main lens, the wide and macro just did not make sense at all and are completely worthless in this segment, this is literally the same setup from Nord 2T but just a better software optimisation, front camera is alright too, nothing that great

- Charging indeed is one of the key factors in this phone but it takes a toll on the battery backup, usually in my usage I have to charge it 2 times for it to be used the whole day, it drains a bit more than I expected it to, also there's no option available to disable 150W charging to let it charge in usual speed to test the battery, only except for the night optimisation mode, which is kind of good in my opinion.

Phone is a good segment in this price range and If you do believe in the particular brand image and it's products then go for it. Although Iqoo 9T does provide a better camera setup with a bit more aggressive processor performance, but this device does the job too."
3713,4.0,"So here I am writing my review after having used this device for over two weeks.
Pros-

1. Processor- Processor is a beast. This latest Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 is so optimized that you're never gonna lag behind.

2. Battery life- Usually phones that have fast charging, their battery drains really fast but I dont know how oneplus has managed to ace in this department. It has a 160watt supervooc fast charger and charges the device withing 20 mins. And once you've charged the device completely it provides you enough juice for More than a day.

3. OS- I was totally disappointed when I heard that oppo has merged the OXygen os with color os, because Oxygen os had stock android like feeling. But believe me guys this new os is not that bad either. It has features of both the UIs and its super snappy.

4. Mutitasking- you dont have to worry about that department either because of the beast processor this phone is equipped with.

5- Build Quality- Build quality is okay since it has a plastic frame. Both sides are equipped with glass pannel. The in hand feel is good. It looks premium. And the Alert slider (those who know, know) is missing but you'll get used to it. My previous oneplus's aler slider got damaged just after 2 months of purchasing.

Cons-

1. Camera- Camera Sucks big time. Dont know what was their logic of 50 + 16 + 2 combination. Its a flagship device and I dont know why they din provice Hassleblad Cameras. 2 MP microscope lens is good for nothing useless.

2. Freezes- Although the UI is super snappy but it still freezes quite often. And what I do is press and hold the Power and Volume Up Button and it restarts the device. But its still annoying."
3714,5.0,"A rare combination of high-end specs delivering a stunning performance using a greatly optimized OS. I was not expecting such a blistering performance from an Android device. Although there are few compromises on the hardware front such as removal of alert slider button, it's certainly not a deal breaker. The design of the phone is not pathbreaking, but actually could differentiate from other me-too phones. The unique camera setup helps to differentiate this phone with others. It's a kind of proprietary design for One Plus 10 series. The photos come good if not excellent. I could buy it at 36k with ICICI bank CC offer, combined with an exchange. At 36k it's a steal for sure. If you are looking for a real fast phone, has a decent 6.7 inch-120 Hz screen, a unique look to flaunt, One Plus 10T presents itself as a worthy option to consider."
3715,5.0,Recieved a defective piece got it returned but to travel to service centre and get it returned has been hectic. The money I saved in discounts and festive offer most of it gone in travelling to service centre again and again. The exchange of the product for a replacement teh service centre people behave as they have fought a war to get the replacement. Would recommend one plus 10 pro for better camera or apple product
3716,5.0,">screen is good.
>main camera is good, rest 2 lenses are poor.
>Phone battery lasts for 12 hours according to my usage so no complain .
>Has Dolby for music output which many phones don't have.
>Theres no heating issue or lag.
>Call recorder has voice alert while recording.
>Phone gets charged very fast (apple fanboys can only dream about it).
>Overall a perfect phone with least issues under 50k....do miss old oxygen OS but will get used to with new os as well ."
3717,5.0,"I have Pixel 7. Yesterday I purchased this 8GB/128 GB varient.

Cons : Average selfie camera post day light.
Back camera and processing is also ok only.

Pros where it beats Pixel 7/Pro :

1) Fluidity, Performance in apps, multi tasking where you constantly switch open 5-10 apps throughout the day.
No one closes apps after introduction of gesture navigation.

None of apps are gaming apps.

2) No warming with 5G, wifi, 70-80% brightness.

3) Speakers Sound Quality and loudness.

4) Battery- Pixel barely manages 4:30-5:00 Hrs.
OnePlus 10T, easily goes 7:30-8:00 Hrs. Screen on time, with all AOD, haptics, location, Bluetooth etc on.

5) Charging: Pixel takes 1:30 Hrs, OnePlus took 19-20 mins from 0 to 100.

6) Haptics- Both are equal in everyday usage.

Summary: In 45-50K, this is best value for money as well as performance oriented device to buy for. Not just in gaming, but in all apps, it shows its power."

3739,5.0,Look like premium. Phone is so cool and charging 10 - 15 min full charge. But battery drain fast. If u use game internet max 5-6 hours.
3740,5.0,"Phone build - the phone feels premium at hand. It feels awesome. The case that comes in box feels cheap(but atleast we get a case) don't forget to order a case with phone.

Screen - the screen is just awesome. No bugs no lags during scrolling. As a heavy user and gamer I had an awesome experience with it. The screen quality and display are just wow.

Charging - the best part of the phone. In the times where all other phones are removing chargers. Oneplus 10t comes with a massive 150Watt charging brick. Its just the fastest charging I have seen. The phone goes 0 to 100 in 20 mins sharp. Constant performance, every single time. I am getting 5 percent per minute charging speed.

Battery life- the battery life is long. It can last 9 10 hours screen time. I have never felt battery drains and its fast charging never lets you down.

Processing and heating - I never felt any lags in phone or game. The phone is just buttery smooth. I didn't feel any heating issues even during 150 watt fast charging.

Camera-I am not a camera guy, but still I took few pics. The cameras are ok. Not the best in segment according to other reviews but I don't have camera expertise to speak up. For me the camera was same as any other. Pics quality were good, that's enough for most.

Overall at this price point-this is the best phone you can get. With oneplus brand name and all the latest value. I love the fact that I can just use the phone out of the box. There's case there's charger. Everything is present. I have exchanged my older oneplus so I just had to put my Sim in, put the case and started using it.
The most underrated phone I would say♥️"
3741,5.0,"It's good mobile,if you normal working guy not a chapri tik tokker and want higher specs phone which can run apps smoothly without draining much of battery.

3751,4.0,"Really superfast charging
It also drains somewhat quickly. So those who have heavy usage and don't want to charge a second time may wait for the gen 2 processor as I read that the battery drain issue is due to the processor. The charger is also somewhat bulky.
Camera is pretty good though I am no photo enthusiast.
Display is great
Weight, build, grip are good.
Fingerprint could have been better.
The case given by the company is really very cheap and looks like made from repeatedly recycled plastic.
Bought at a net price of 39.5k after discount of bank offer of 5k and exchange of two year old redmi note 9 pro max for 10.5k.
I feel sorry for the customers who got defective pieces but that is how it would have been even if we bought from a shop. However Amazon customer service is deteriorating possibly because of government policies and abuse of return policy by many of the customers.
Except battery issue and the cheap case, I feel it is a value for money product."

3759,4.0,"So I'm an android user for 15 years posting this review after one week of usage

Pros
1. Security - without your permission no app can track you
2. Camera - the quality and features and detailing is amazing. U can shoot a cinema with this beast !
3. Battery - huge battery that lasts easily one full day despite heavy usage
4. Fast and sleek - 0 lag experienced
5. Looks - I bought red and it's a killer
6. Display - big screen 6.7 and nothing to complaint at all
7. Features - it even tells u how long u slept last night 😂 lots of options available under "" health "" that android can only dream of

Cons
1. iOS is not as easy/simple as android without the BACK button
2. It is expensive
As u can see the cons are literally nothing if u want a solid all-round mobile phone for the next 3-4 years atleast.. iPhone 14+ is amazing ❤️"
3760,4.0,"Booked this on 14th October and received product on 15th October. Super fast delviery from Amazon. Product is genuine.
I am an Andriod user from past 10 years, I have apple products (Macbook, Ipod and Ipad), but first time I am buying iphone.
After using for 13 days I can give my feedback as below:

Pros:
1) Superb display
2) Camera is really good. I think nobody can beat Iphone camera pictures quality.
3) Battery after heavy usage I got it for more than 24 hours (100% to 25%)
4) For phone banking and money transaction, apple has highest security.
5) Speed is good

Cons:
1) Apple should have incorporated 120 Hz flash rate instead they kept at 60Hz in this model.
2) No call recording option.
3) If you have used to Andriod, then it will take time to adjust to IOS OS."
3761,4.0,"This is my first Apple product. I was android user through out life, but apple experience is different. Camera and battery performance is awesome."
3762,4.0,i would recommend iphone 13 which i feel is VFM and 14 plus for those who just needs a bigger screen and better battery life. Android has still a lot to catch up especially with the battery management.

3774,4.0,"This is going to be a detailed review. It is for both Iphone users as well as for someone who is thinking of shifting to Iphone from an Android phone.
Price: I bought the phone on Diwali day from a local popular mobile vendor in Surat. MRP was 90k. But With GST credit, HDFC credit card discount, Apple's discount for exchange and the exchange value for my old Android phone (1plus7 pro), it costed me approx. Rs. 50k. I would definitely not spend 90k for a phone and am pretty sure most average indian would not. I think all in all the phone is Value for money if it costs you between 50 and 60k. Most android flagships too have started costing upwards of 45k. My rating for price I bought: 4.5/5
Looks of Phone: I liked the overall look of the phone. I bought blue colour which has a nice premium and sophisticated look to it. Design and feel is pretty solid in hands. With right back cover to highlight that logo on back,, it attracts gaze of others and after an android experience, you do feel privileged to hold an Iphone in your hands. The flat side strip screams sophistication and glass back is also nice. Compared to my last phone 1plus 7 pro, the only thing I found lacking was the curved screen which gives an added appeal to looks. Overall I was satisfied. My rating for looks: 4/5
Screen and display: I bought the 14 plus and not 14 only because I was already accustomed to a big 6.7"" screen and did not want to compromise on it. So am happy with the screen size on 14plus. However I have two big grouses against the screen. Firstly I expected a faster refresh rate considering it's a phone with an MRP almost double of android flagship phones. 60Hz is too less when even my 4 year old 1plus 7 pro had 90Hz as refresh rate. It definitely affects the clarity of fast moving vidoes and clarity when scrolling the screen. Secondly, I was just not prepared for the ""Big Notch effect"" on my viewing screen. My older phone was a no notch phone as it had a sliding front camera. It was just 6.7 inches of uninterrupted real estate. Further, the curved screen looked gorgeous and fullscreen videos were a viewing pleasure. But in Iphone this notch is an ugly eyesore and I am already feeling irritated and dread the thought of putting up with it for the rest of our life together. My overall rating 3.5/5
Speed of performance: This is one area which I was really looking forward to, especially after reading so many reviews online and hearing from friends. Frankly, I have not been disappointed. It was a relief to finally interact with all my favourite apps without any lag or stutter. And to stop checking if too many apps were open and thus slowing down my phone performance. I guess the made-for-each-other software and hardware really helps apple to outshine any competition in speed. Full marks to apple for creating this phenomenal athlete. My rating 4.5/5
TV Connectivity: I have an android smart TV at home and was a bit apprehensive how I will be able to cast stuff from my phone to the TV. But it seems that almost all OTT apps now have an inbuilt chromecast feature. And truth be told, the phone was casting much more lag free and without any stutters compared to my old android flagship. Further I discovered Air Screen app on TV which allows my Iphone screen to be cast on an android TV using inbuilt airplay. My rating 5/5
Mobile, bluetooth and Wifi connectivity: There is one physical SIM tray for indian Iphone 14 series and option to add 8 E-sims if you want more than one connection in phone. You can install upto 8 esims but only one will be active while other 7 will be inactive. I added my JIO esim at home, which although easy for me could be a bit formidable for non-tech people. Phone seemed to be good in latching onto the network , although it was same as my old phone. Bluetooth is 5.3 and works well with all soundbars, earphones, TWS earbuds, etc. Wifi connectivity was also good and no issues with it even after I upgraded to OS 16.1 although few users were complaining online. My overall rating 5/5
Battery life: This is where the Iphone 14 plus has been a game changer for me. Battery seems to be huge and inspite of heavy usage full day, I am left with 40-50% battery at end of day. I am extremely pleased with the performance and strongly recommend to heavy users this phone just for it's battery. It is a huge relief and I am no longer anxious or stressed of running out of battery before end of day. Total peace of mind. My rating 5/5
Privacy and Security: Every app that asks for tracking my activity has to now ask for permission. Although Android has also improved its system of permissions and more importantly access to hardware like camera, mic, etc, it is still behind when it comes to user security. One thing that I missed initially and still do occasionally is finger print reader. In low light conditions and especially when my phone is lying on side and not in front of my face, I have to type in the security code. That is just so tiresome in 2022. Otherwise, Face ID is blazing fast and very accurate. My rating 4.5/5
User interface: This is one area where I am yet to come to terms with as compared to an android phone. I am still puzzled at the obstinacy and insistence of Apple to not provide a universal back button on Iphone. Why Apple why? It makes using the various apps on Iphone a steep learning curve for most. Especially in frequently used apps like e.g., whatsapp, I curse apple everytime I have to move my hand on top left corner to go back. It is just not that intuitive or simple. My rating for this 2.5/5
Customisation: This is another area which I feel Iphone needs huge improvement. Although I was aware that Apple is nowhere in allowing customisation compared to an android phone, I was still not expecting such a dull and monotonous environment. Even you can't change wallpapers on the go by choosing any picture and setting it as a wallpaper. You can only do it a certain way. My rating for this 3.5/5
Apps availability: Almost as soon as I got the phone I wanted to create parallel (cloned) apps for some of the social media and messaging apps. Alas, there is no option for the same. Further, few apps that did promise had pathetic reviews and wanted me to subscribe before allowing to clone any apps. This is one major lacuna. Having said that, I was happy to see that almost the apps that I had been using in my old android phone were available to download on Iphone. Support for all Google apps like maps, drive, gboard, photos, gmail, etc. is also excellent. That was such a relief and made the transition to new OS and phone so much easy. My rating 4/5
Sound: The phone has Dolby atmos (which I had in my 4 years old 1plus 7 pro too) which is still the cutting edge sound quality as of date. Speakers are well placed and give good output like most other phones, although they can never replace a dedicated speaker set. My rating 4.5/5
Camera: The camera quality is what is supposed to set Iphone apart from most other phones out there. I did not go for the 3 camera setup of pro or pro max as I was okay as long as I got good quality pics in my budget. While the camera is definitely good, coming from 1plus 7 pro, I do not think it has induced a major change in my life. My 1plus 7 pro pics were also almost always well-appreciated by friends and family. I guess phone is important but it is also important who takes the pics and how well. Anyways, I am still learning the nuances of my new phone's camera so maybe I may ultimately learn how to take earth-shattering pics on an Iphone. Until then my rating is 4/5.
This review was written after 10 days of usage. I admit that it is early days yet and as time passes I will get more accustomed to the new OS and quirks and features of the new Iphone. But these are my initial observations and I wanted to share them with wannabe Iphone users before I forgot them.
Inspite of some poor ratings in individual areas, I feel that the phone does have a lot of good things going for it. Therefore my overall rating is 4.5/5 for the new Iphone14 plus."

3779,4.0,Amazing product this time apple I upgraded from OnePlus 8pro to plus this time apple doing great job love this phone
3780,4.0,"I have never seen like this phone in my life.
Best phone in iphone
I like all functions in this"
3781,4.0,"Coming from an iPhone XR (which I used happily with no complaints at all for 3+ years), the iPhone 14 plus made for a huge upgrade, in terms of display, battery, camera etc. Now, if you already have an iPhone 13, it doesn't make sense to go for the 14 given that the upgrade is negligible, but if you have an older iPhone (X/XS/XR/11/12), the new iPhone/Plus is a visual treat.

I wanted a larger display without splurging on the Pro variant, and I love that Apple has introduced a Plus variant (something they did last with the iPhone 7 in 2016), for folks like me.

I've had the 14 plus 256gb variant for just a day now, and here are my initial thoughts:

1. Battery: An absolute beast. Out of the box it had ~45% charge, and 24 hours later it's just touching the 15% mark now after fairly extensive usage (browsing, gaming, streaming music). Make sure to buy a 20W charger to reap the fast charging benefits :)

2. Setup: Buttery-smooth onboarding, took all of 15 mins to transfer data from my old phone to my new one. Had a bit of trouble pairing my Apple Watch with my 14 plus though, that wasn't the best of experiences.

3. Display: A treat for the eyes! The supersized 6.7 inch screen makes for a beautiful experience as you stream OTT content, play games, or use the camera for photography/filming. However, since the display is so large, a lot of content tends to look blurred/out of focus.

4. Camera: Gorgeous, gorgeous picture quality even in low light. Again, not an upgrade from the 13, but for people like me, the camera is an absolute delight.

5. Build: The supersized 6.7 inch screen feels large in my hands, but no heavier than my iPhone XR. It feels comfortable enough to hold for hours as you watch, browse and game. In other words, despite the mammoth size, it feels as light as its smaller iPhone counterparts.

6. Colour: Ordered the lavender shade, but it's not a very pronounced colour. In daylight it looks almost white.

7. Delivery: Pre-ordered on 23rd September, received it on 9th October (2 days after it released). Kudos to Amazon for the super prompt delivery!

Verdict: this is a worthwhile option if you have the funds and if you are coming from a much older variant of the iPhone or switching from Android. If you have a 13 or 13 pro, this one will feel like a disappointment.

Will update this review as I continue using it, but so far I am extremely impressed!"
3782,4.0,Good product for price.
3783,4.0,value for money
3784,4.0,If you are planning for iPhone with larger display and larger battery. Go for this. Pro max is 50k higher than this model. But for most users this will be awesome!

3793,5.0,"Almost perfect for the price of 15k.

Misses on the wide angle lens and the camera quality is good for normal pics. Videos and nightography is pathetic. Macro is surprisingly great! Overall average camera.

Battery is above average with around 9 hrs screen time at 60 Hz and around 7.5 with 90 Hz refresh rate.

Performance is the best for the price... Snapdragon 480 ~ Snapdragon 600 series

Best display for the price. 90 Hz is very good and the colours are perfect. Loving the display!"
3794,4.0,"I bought it yesterday, so I'm writing honestly, this phone is osm , display is very gud , bettry life perfect , looks to mza hi aagya... But if front camera be 16 mp so it's going crazy pr overall selfie camera perform well in day. But noise is too much in night. But if u r not a selfie lover u can go for it."
3795,4.0,Every feature are awesome 😎 cool but Camera 📸 quality is worst and battery is taking longer time to charge next can be upgraded this so it can be considered as best budget phone
3796,4.0,"After using iphone for years wanted to have new secondary phone, never had expectations on Android for flawless performance basis past experience, but this phone performance had changed my perception on Android phones n Oppo brand.

The battery is really good. With 6gb ram octa-core processor and 128gb ram it's a good phone. However it should not be compared with other similar products available at higher Price because those products use different processors for which the price goes up. The camera is just a decent one but not very good.
It depends what are you looking for. If you want a good camera with better processor then you have to spend more. At such price it will replace redmi phones, because it does outshine redmi phones in all aspects."

Her only grudge is that the colours are a little muted and not as rich as she wanted it. Even when we tinkered with settings, it did not change much. Secondly, the micro USB port is a let down in the times of USB C. We had junked all our Micro USB chargers ... thankfully, they included one. THE BIGGEST LETDOWN of all is the absence of an earphone in the set. That is a big letdown. After spending so much, cannot understand the issue in providing an earphone. We had to invest money additionally in buying an earphone."

4. Speaker quality is good without too much treble.
5. Camera is ok for selfie and main camera performance is above average with less noise.
6. Camera in front is small so notch is not distracting while playing video.
Cons :-
1.Main camera struggles after 3x zoom.And video call performance of front camera is inferior to stock selfie photo.
2. 18 watt charger took 1hr30 mins to charge 80% of the phone.So charging speed is not time saving for this big battery."

Yeah it is 4G and not 5G, but in India 4G is still very much available and I guess it will take another 3 to 4 years to obsolete 4G fully. Also, considering the fact of durability of an android phone for 4 years, it is now one of the best in the market. Display is super good with amoled screen. Battery power and 44watt charger is really good. It takes around 50 minutes to fully charge the phone. Android 12 is available from the beginning only. Sound quality is nice. Design is an eye catchy thing, specially the backside. Camera is 3.5 out of 5 as I personally like Iphone's camera very much. At the end I will say this is a value for money product."

1. Poor Camera quality, its ok-ish.
2. High delay in Gyro (Something to be noted by gamers)
3. Although it has 18W charging speed which does the work for me but still 33W would have been great.
Apart from this I am happy with the device. The battery backup is great, the screen quality is phenomenal with 120 Hz and the Snapdragon Gen 4 1 processor is working phenomenal."

Yeah it is 4G and not 5G, but in India 4G is still very much available and I guess it will take another 3 to 4 years to obsolete 4G fully. Also, considering the fact of durability of an android phone for 4 years, it is now one of the best in the market. Display is super good with amoled screen. Battery power and 44watt charger is really good. It takes around 50 minutes to fully charge the phone. Android 12 is available from the beginning only. Sound quality is nice. Design is an eye catchy thing, specially the backside. Camera is 3.5 out of 5 as I personally like Iphone's camera very much. At the end I will say this is a value for money product."

4001,4.0,"The device is working phenomenally and the processor is just great. The only three drawbacks which I have come across are:
1. Poor Camera quality, its ok-ish.
2. High delay in Gyro (Something to be noted by gamers)
3. Although it has 18W charging speed which does the work for me but still 33W would have been great.
Apart from this I am happy with the device. The battery backup is great, the screen quality is phenomenal with 120 Hz and the Snapdragon Gen 4 1 processor is working phenomenal."
4002,4.0,"I'do like the most combination of things

4034,4.0,"I am not big on camera usage, personally. I was even mentally prepared for a bad camera, based on some reviews here. But I was pleasantly surprised that camera clicks good photos. They are not awesome, but they are decent photos that can even be shared.
Now coming to my biggest grouse; heating issue. The phone started heating up while charging, but it was just a little and so I could have ignored it. But then it started heating up more and got me very concerned. I even ordered a replacement thinking I got a defective piece. But then, after further tests, I found that it is heating more when I download huge amounts of data, for example, when I restore data of my old phone, from back up. This is ok with me as, I don't perform huge data loads regularly, definitely not on phone. Then I tested by running tasks I usually perform such as checking office mails, attending office meeting on phone, watching a video from Amazon Prime, and so on. The phone did not heat up even a little. Personally, this is good for me.
At this price range, this is a good phone. But if you are camera heavy user and expect to perform heavy downloads frequently, this phone may not for you. I am personally satisfied with this phone as it works for my type of usage. I will not go into plus points of this phone as they are covered by other reviews already. I am only attempting to clarify about how this phone can suit you (or not) in terms of camera and heating. I had many questions about these aspects before buying. Perhaps this review will help you make an informed decision to buy (or avoid). Cheers."

4065,4.0,"I am writing this review after using the phone for a month. I got it for 8.5k during the Amazon Great Indian Festival and it's a great purchase for the price. I bought this phone after reading a lot of reviews and watching many videos and I must say that I am happy with my decision.
I was looking for a phone with 4 GB ram and 64 GB internal storage as storage space was the biggest drawback of my old phone. Also, I am not a very heavy user, so the battery works great for me. However, my biggest concern was lagging - as many reviews had mentioned that this phone has lagging issues. However, after using it for a week, my concerns were put to rest. The phone may lag once in a while, but the overall user experience is good. It's great for watching content, listening to podcasts and audiobooks, checking emails and performing other daily tasks. The camera quality is decent. What more can one expect at this price.
So overall, I am happy with the purchase. It's a good option for those who are looking for a budget phone and are not very heavy users."

4219,4.0,"The Samsung Galaxy M53 5G mobile phone is awesome.I like its design- slim trim and the way the 4 back camera are crafted. Design wise Its *****(5 star).The coffee colour body gives a special beauty too !!.

What a CRAP this phone is !!!!. Totally not worthy for Rs 22,000/-. The 108 Megapixel camera photo quality is very poor and the vdo shot on this mobile does not give a good vdo, sometime hard to identify clear objects.Its light sensitivity and AI adjustment to light effect is extremely poor. My earlier phone Redmi note 9 pro which cost Rs14000 has 64 megapixel camera is far far better in photo quality and vdo pixel. Also, the youtube vdo watch on this samsung phone got hanged up sometimes and sometimes unable to play it inspite of a good internet connection. I need to restart the phone for re playing the youtube vdo. In my opinion technically this phone should be worth not more than Rs.10,000. Huge amount has been charged by the brand 'Samsung' .What a loss for us !!!"

For instinct your speaker volume gets reduced when some notifications comes.but after notification has gone the speaker sound remain same and does not increase. The better life is moderate and camera quality is good. Although the image you see while taking the photo and image after are completely different. I bought this on a sale at 18k only. worth the money.

Worse - There is no 3MM jack. So searching USB type C to 3mm Jack corrector to fit my mic and other devices
Battery - Battery drains very fastly compared to my old samsung M20 . Worse Thing is that Charger is not there. Using my old Samsung Charger. Also the cable supplied has both side Type C.

Before buying pls check whether you are adept in Type C only . Also Charger costs around 1800/-"

4232,4.0,"I am a loyal Samsung mobile user. it's been years, haven't used any other mobile except Samsung ones.
To start with it has a sleek body, look and feel of a high end smart phone
Display is the best thing.
Cam with 108 mega pix - super quality pics.
Same selfie cam but so many features, I like the object eraser feature a lot. as if you have a photoshop program inbuilt in your mobile itself.
rest all is at par.
Con : No provision for audio card input, you have to use wireless headphones!
So sleek and delicate that you need to be careful all the time.

Overall : Loved it ! am writing it after using for more than 4 months. no complaints at all."
4233,4.0,All fetcher is best but ir sensor issue

1.Battery life is Nice.

4.Inbuilt Video recording nice.
5.To take Screenshot it's required Power+Volume button. Different to use Pam swipe inbuilt facilities for screenshot.

7. Initial connection it require near by Wifi Source Comper to my other mobile.."
4237,4.0,Like
4238,4.0,It is the best mobile device I had ever had.
4239,4.0,"1.both Camera quality must be good in this high range but not.
2.beside battery capacity is 5000 mAH but performance is not so good.
3.tuch panel is Good.
4.sound quality is good in one speaker.
5.fast charging is not fast charging it takes a lot time.
Overall phone price should be within range of 15 k to 18k but not more than 20k"
4240,4.0,"I like it's design, build quality, bright display ,call quality and camera. The cons are, battery does not last a day with average use. No 3.5mm headphone jack and no stereo speakers. Side mounted FP sensor is old fashioned. I bought this phone because it's a non Chinese phone and Samsung is a trusted brand with best service network.My Samsung M51 with massive battery is still giving flawless service."
4241,4.0,Battery thodi bakar h
4242,4.0,The Samsung Galaxy M53 is a great display phone but rest everything is just an average for the cost....Even you need to buy the phone charger seperately which cost you around Rs. 1300/- for 25 Watt which is not worth as per the charging speed @2022 . Only the display was exceptional but rest other features were just okay.....the heart of this phone which is call processor Mediteck 900 can just handle basic task Without any issues but can't do heavy multitasking and long gaming sessions..... overall this not the packege for any gamers but basic Day to day users.
4243,4.0,Good product
4244,4.0,"All features are good but needs improvement in following aspects..
1.there should have been a short cut for Taking screenshot
2.the feature of blocking unknown and private number is non functional
3.when we click on recent call log then it should also show call history of that contact without any further click"
4245,4.0,"Date of purchase: 26.09.22

Actual Price = 21999 - 2000 (SBI card discount) - 2000 (coupon) = 17999/- = 18000/-
Additional Charges = 1279 (charger) + 500 (c type to 3.5mm connector for your headphone and mic etc.) + 100 (screen guard) + 200 (back case) = 2079/-
Total min. price including all discount: (18000 + 2000) = 20000/-

I wasted very much time finding a case & a 3.5 mm connector. still, the connector is not compatible. this should be provided with a mobile.

General Quality:
Very Slim, Lightweight, best display, screen size is perfect for reading, good finishing, Camera quality is good in this range. elegant look etc.

The main problem is not providing type C to 3.5mm connectors. Due to this, my other accessories like headphones & Mic can not be used with this mobile. case & screen guard should provide. Low performance..."
4246,4.0,"All good. Night mode Camera is average.
But, what's the point in buying without charging adapter. That too a C-Type charging cable comes with both ends C-type.
Have to shed extra 1,500/- for adapter"
4247,4.0,"Best camera, finger print, face lock, display etc but battery 🔋 life not long for 24 hours. Charger not get, other adapter not suit for best charging , it take so many times. Finally I bought an original samsung 25 watt adapter, it's fast"
4248,4.0,Good
4249,4.0,"Its been the 2nd day i have been using this phone... The overall phone is average & with way description and phone features are highlighted, it doesn't stand to that good quality vs price.

- Camera not matching 108 Pixels
- Battery 1 Day for average usage. For movies /gaming it won't last more that 1/2 day
- Built & design is good
- Phone screen is not that responsive. Gets stucked sometimes.."
4250,4.0,I liked the colour ...camera was good
4251,4.0,Sometimes phone is hang this is an only issue
4252,4.0,Sidemounted fingerprint is good battery gets drain for heavy usage user friendly.
4253,3.0,Looks like classy specially back panel.Fingure print should be in screen.Then this would beat any phone ranges between 30 to 35k.
4254,4.0,"I'm using this phone from around 15 days...what I experienced I'm writing....display is beautiful...camera is descent ,not super...but many inbuilt camera features are there that helps a lot to edit pics....after tempered glass , sometimes touch doesn't respond on time...don't know why...speaker is ok...price is high because samsung has its brand value...other brands also providing same features in less amount...battery is also average...Software experience is good with UI 4...let's see how it behaves in long run."
4255,4.0,"The look is very good, camera quality is quite good and the performance is also quite good. The nfc is not there in the phone and that is the bad thing."
4256,4.0,Exchange of my old phone amount was too low
4257,4.0,Display is gorgeous. But the 32 MP front camera is the worst. Its so bad I cant even describe. Dont buy it if you want to click selfies.
4258,4.0,Quality is great .. but it doesn't come with adapter... If you are planning to buy samsung M53 5g..you have to buy adapter seperately
4259,4.0,"The phone is slim which makes it look attractive.
Samsung is the brand so the sensitivity and touch is descent.Expecting a fast sensitivity.No adapter so little to worry here as fast charge would support or not so I am going with 25W adapter only.
Camera is not upto the mark when it talks about 108 MP. Samsung should provide enhancer built in with camera.
Budgeted phone overall."
4260,4.0,Good in performance after software update
4261,4.0,"Samsung m53 mobile ka touch Achha nhi he. Bar bar touch krne pr bhi kam nhi krta.
Bettery life b kam he din bhar bina use krne pr bhi kam ho jati he."
4262,4.0,It did get hot a few times but overall it's a good value
4263,4.0,Good camera with sAmoled display under 23000
4264,4.0,"No earphone slot, very very difficult to take selfie by swapping Palm. Touch is also not of high quality. Lags to Reddme in Quantity, features and at price front"
4265,4.0,"Like the face unlock better than my previous A51 version
RAM plus actually works - for an average user you can opt for 6gb version.... in terms of RAM definitely better than 6gb A51 with no ram plus
Camera is good
Wifi is worse thN Redmi6 keeps disconnecting- extremely annoying if you have multiple routers in you home"
4266,4.0,"Side Fingerprint reader is legendary instead of amoled ,,, I m not advertising but purchase under 21k
Not deserve more than 21k"
4267,4.0,"The Samsung Galaxy M53 5G mobile phone is awesome.I like its design- slim trim and the way the 4 back camera are crafted. Design wise Its *****(5 star).The coffee colour body gives a special beauty too !!.

What a CRAP this phone is !!!!. Totally not worthy for Rs 22,000/-. The 108 Megapixel camera photo quality is very poor and the vdo shot on this mobile does not give a good vdo, sometime hard to identify clear objects.Its light sensitivity and AI adjustment to light effect is extremely poor. My earlier phone Redmi note 9 pro which cost Rs14000 has 64 megapixel camera is far far better in photo quality and vdo pixel. Also, the youtube vdo watch on this samsung phone got hanged up sometimes and sometimes unable to play it inspite of a good internet connection. I need to restart the phone for re playing the youtube vdo. In my opinion technically this phone should be worth not more than Rs.10,000. Huge amount has been charged by the brand 'Samsung' .What a loss for us !!!"
4268,4.0,Great phone in budget. Back panel is kind of cheap quality plastic. Otherwise it works well. Camera quality is good.display quality is good.
4269,4.0,avarage tipe mobile not better
4270,4.0,"I like it's thickness....
There is only one issue on samsung all smartphone...that is network issue....
I am using this but network very slow as compare to my realme device.."
4271,4.0,The display is amazing. A little downside of this phone is the minor bugs. For instinct your speaker volume gets reduced when some notifications comes.but after notification has gone the speaker sound remain same and does not increase. The better life is moderate and camera quality is good. Although the image you see while taking the photo and image after are completely different. I bought this on a sale at 18k only. worth the money.
4272,4.0,"Finger print me thoda sa problem hai , battery life bohot achhi hai or sath hi camera bhi bohot achha hai"

4418,3.0,"PROS:
1.Design is best at price of 7k and 4 64 with fingerprint
2.Display is acceptable (it's a long phone)
3. Battery life is around 9hours but
You need to disable some important settings of Google and MIUI
You can visit TECHNOBUZZNET channel to disable miui and Google tracker

It would increase performance and battery backup so much now I get around 12 hours

4. PERFORMANCE IS NOT good cuz it hangs a lot during set up
But now after updating device and system app also Google play store app
It works now normally

Cons:
1. MIUI 12.5 with a Android 11 is difficult to handle for G25
It's lag sometimes not always

2. Camera is simply worst
Even my redmi 8a dual take better picture than it( cuz I don't updating it)
But it's portrait mode works lovely

3. Don't update this device to MIUI 13 in future cuz G25 can't handle Android 12 and MIUI 13 together
And u would find so performance gap and poor battery backup
As usual MIUI update

Additional - pictures given in sample is captured in pro mode settings

4438,4.0,Although most of things about purchase can be considered decent given the price I paid for it but the most unjustifiable problem with the phone was it's performance.

I first thought it's just happening because we're setting it up but it persisted and is still quite slow. Also the fingerprint sensor is also not that responsive. Overall Average to poor experience.

4516,4.0,"Bought this phone recently. I got it for 6759/- something, basically under 7k. MRP was 9,999/- + I've exchanged my Redmi 7 for 2600. Felt like a fair deal to me. Now let's get to the phone part.
See,this is a decent phone if you are planning to buy it for parents,or for yourself. Make sure you buy it under 10k.
If you can exchange,do that. But if you are looking for a phone in 11-12k, I'd suggest,go for Realme Narzo 50. It's better in terms of charging (33W),in hand feel is same I'd say,but the processor is better as well (G95) compared to Redmi 10 Prime (G88).
Nevertheless,if you want this phone only,here are a couple of things you should know about it.
Camera:- Decent. The Color reproduction is good. Don't expect much from dark mode,but in good daylight conditions,with the 50 MP main sensor, you'd get detailed photos. Selfie is decent as well,as you expect from 10-15k smartphones.

Processor:- Good enough,no major heating issues,plus it is superior compared to the generic Snapdragon 680 which every smartphone company is using these days. HDR content is supported on YouTube. The only con G88 has compared to the Snapdragon 680 is the battery life,since the latter is 6 nm based,and the former is 12nm. But you don't have to worry about it,since it has 6000 mAh battery packed inside.
Feel:- The phone is thick on paper,like really thick,but you won't feel the thickness while holding it. It could've been slimmer but this is what we get. The vibration motor is good enough,not smooth like Z- Axis in some Redmi smartphones,but you can change the intensity and you are good to go.

Display:- The display is good and big enough. It has a full HD IPS panel,and a good one. Viewing content on Netflix and Prime Video is good. Supports Widevine L1 as well. The refresh rate is good. I felt it. It might not be as smooth in some third party apps like Reddit or twitter but it's smooth in the UI. It has a punch hole display which is rare in this price range.

Software:- It runs on Android 11,and MIUI 12.5,which is a bummer. I can bear Android 11 at this price range,but they should have at least given MIUI 13. 12.5 gets the job done too,but it's not as polished,plus the animations are limited. Like when you close the app,you don't get the animation and it closes abruptly. Apart from that,no bugs found yet. No screen flickering issue in low brightness. Nothing of that sort. I hate to say it,but I am kind of liking MIUI,only because of the familiarity of it. Everyone has once used a MI phone in their life,so it feels like a familiar territory.

Battery and Charging:- As I previously stated,it has 6000 mAh battery which lasts longer. You can easily get upto 1.5-2 days on normal usage.
Charger is 22.5 W inside the box,but the phone supports 18W. So,you can charge the phone in almost 2 hours,from 0. No complains there.

Conclusion:- So,this is all you need to know about the phone. I recommend it,but make sure you get it under 10k. If not,go for POCO M4 Pro,or Realme Narzo 50. You could get it around 12k. They are superior in most of the aspects than Redmi 10 Prime. Thank you for reading,hope that helped.
And if some of you are curious about 2021 and 2022 version of 10 Prime, don't worry. They are exactly the same.

Edit:- Surprisingly,it has got MIUI 13, Android 12 based in November. Just wanted to let you guys know."
4517,4.0,"Used this phone for a week and here's my initial experience with this phone :

> My previous phone was Honor 10 Lite which I bought for ₹7,999 in 2019. Now this Redmi 10 Prime which I bought for ₹11,999 doesn't seem to be a big upgrade.

> Display is good and almost same as my previous phone except for the 90Hz display which is kind of useless. Lags a lot while scrolling in Twitter, YouTube, etc. while my Honor doesn't. In 60Hz, it's fine. So for me, 90Hz is just a gimmick.

> 6000mAh Battery is too good. Lasts for 2 days without recharging with 9Hours+ SOT. My Honor has a 3400mAh battery and it used to give 6.5hours+ when it was new.
Only a small problem, it drains around 3% battery overnight and still misses notifications when I check in the morning, while my Honor doesn't even drain a single percent without missing a single notification. It hardly drains 1% sometimes. But this isn't a big issue. Overall, its battery performance is impressive.

> Camera is disappointing. This one has a 50+8+2+2MP camera setup and my Honor has 13+2MP. But they perform almost same. Macro, Ultrawide is useless. UW makes everything grainy. Main camera does well when switched to 50MP mode, otherwise details are same as my Honor. Edge detection is worse than Honor. Takes around 3-4 tries to tap and focus and then it works and still blurs ears and hair. Front camera is fine for the price but the image in viewfinder is too much grainy, it looks like a VGA camera. But after taking picture, it processes and gives far better output. It has an 8MP camera and is on par with my Honor's 24MP camera. If HDR/AI mode isn't turned on, then the selfies are also useless.
AI adds too much over sharpening. However I'm impressed by the night mode. It processes and gives a really appealing result.

> Software is good. I haven't received any ADs yet. I carefully checked the TnC & unticked AD personalizations. Also, I uninstalled all the bloatwares immediately after opening. Only GetApps isn't getting uninstalled/disabled. I've restricted its background processes, notifications etc and it's not bothering me. I had also heard that MIUI has a lot of bugs, but thank god I've not encountered any yet. Also, I love its animations. They're fluid and pleasing. However lags in third party apps are easily noticeable. I don't play games, so can't comment about it. I can say, My Honor phone at 60Hz is smoother in third party apps than this phone's 90Hz. It gets warm at the top when using Twitter/Disney+ Hotstar/SonyLIV/Prime Video and while playing FHD+ or higher resolution videos on any app which was not an issue on my Honor

> Best thing I like about this phone is its dual speakers. It's a pleasure to listen to it. The bass, the treble, the highs and lows are just awesome. It's equally loud as my old LCD TV. After buying this device, I came to know on twitter that this is the only device in that price segment that comes with a balanced stereo speaker.

> Network Reception is good. No proximity sensor issue(as many faced in other Xiaomi devices). 4G+ works fine at my location and easily gets 30Mbps+ speed. Though it supports only B40C(2 or 3 other combos are useless like 1C, 3C because Indian operators don't support them yet) , but at least better than many phones which don't even support CA and are prices higher than this. Only problem is BT & Wi-Fi connectivity. It takes about 40-50 seconds to find a hotspot kept next to it, while it only takes 1-2 seconds in my Honor phone. Sometimes, it doesn't even find it and I have to restart Wi-Fi/BT. This is a bug and I hope it's fixed soon. IR remote works with my TV but only On/Off & volume buttons work. Submitted my TV's model number and I hope they'll fix it.

Overall, this phone isn't upto my expectations. Neither am I completely satisfied with it. But it's a good phone for the price. Not worth a penny more than ₹12,000. If it came for ₹11,499 or less, then it was completely value for money.
Redmi Note 10 was launched around the same price but got a price hike otherwise it was 3 times better option than this."

Camera-
Better camera performance than I expected for this price range. The 8mp Ultra wide cam is a gem. 2mp Macro is useless(for me), the main 50mp is really good for the price and it gives well optimised output. And portrait photos are pretty good too. Videos are not the best.
Performance -
Performs all the jobs pretty clean. Social media browsing all goes smooth... The 90hz display is very good. When it comes to gaming... The G88 is not the best. Honestly gaming is good but not great. I don't recommend it for hardcore gamers.

4566,4.0,"Bought this phone recently. I got it for 6759/- something, basically under 7k. MRP was 9,999/- + I've exchanged my Redmi 7 for 2600. Felt like a fair deal to me. Now let's get to the phone part.
See,this is a decent phone if you are planning to buy it for parents,or for yourself. Make sure you buy it under 10k.
If you can exchange,do that. But if you are looking for a phone in 11-12k, I'd suggest,go for Realme Narzo 50. It's better in terms of charging (33W),in hand feel is same I'd say,but the processor is better as well (G95) compared to Redmi 10 Prime (G88).
Nevertheless,if you want this phone only,here are a couple of things you should know about it.
Camera:- Decent. The Color reproduction is good. Don't expect much from dark mode,but in good daylight conditions,with the 50 MP main sensor, you'd get detailed photos. Selfie is decent as well,as you expect from 10-15k smartphones.

Processor:- Good enough,no major heating issues,plus it is superior compared to the generic Snapdragon 680 which every smartphone company is using these days. HDR content is supported on YouTube. The only con G88 has compared to the Snapdragon 680 is the battery life,since the latter is 6 nm based,and the former is 12nm. But you don't have to worry about it,since it has 6000 mAh battery packed inside.
Feel:- The phone is thick on paper,like really thick,but you won't feel the thickness while holding it. It could've been slimmer but this is what we get. The vibration motor is good enough,not smooth like Z- Axis in some Redmi smartphones,but you can change the intensity and you are good to go.

Display:- The display is good and big enough. It has a full HD IPS panel,and a good one. Viewing content on Netflix and Prime Video is good. Supports Widevine L1 as well. The refresh rate is good. I felt it. It might not be as smooth in some third party apps like Reddit or twitter but it's smooth in the UI. It has a punch hole display which is rare in this price range.

Software:- It runs on Android 11,and MIUI 12.5,which is a bummer. I can bear Android 11 at this price range,but they should have at least given MIUI 13. 12.5 gets the job done too,but it's not as polished,plus the animations are limited. Like when you close the app,you don't get the animation and it closes abruptly. Apart from that,no bugs found yet. No screen flickering issue in low brightness. Nothing of that sort. I hate to say it,but I am kind of liking MIUI,only because of the familiarity of it. Everyone has once used a MI phone in their life,so it feels like a familiar territory.

Battery and Charging:- As I previously stated,it has 6000 mAh battery which lasts longer. You can easily get upto 1.5-2 days on normal usage.
Charger is 22.5 W inside the box,but the phone supports 18W. So,you can charge the phone in almost 2 hours,from 0. No complains there.

Conclusion:- So,this is all you need to know about the phone. I recommend it,but make sure you get it under 10k. If not,go for POCO M4 Pro,or Realme Narzo 50. You could get it around 12k. They are superior in most of the aspects than Redmi 10 Prime. Thank you for reading,hope that helped.
And if some of you are curious about 2021 and 2022 version of 10 Prime, don't worry. They are exactly the same.

Edit:- Surprisingly,it has got MIUI 13, Android 12 based in November. Just wanted to let you guys know."
4567,4.0,"Used this phone for a week and here's my initial experience with this phone :

> My previous phone was Honor 10 Lite which I bought for ₹7,999 in 2019. Now this Redmi 10 Prime which I bought for ₹11,999 doesn't seem to be a big upgrade.

> Display is good and almost same as my previous phone except for the 90Hz display which is kind of useless. Lags a lot while scrolling in Twitter, YouTube, etc. while my Honor doesn't. In 60Hz, it's fine. So for me, 90Hz is just a gimmick.

> 6000mAh Battery is too good. Lasts for 2 days without recharging with 9Hours+ SOT. My Honor has a 3400mAh battery and it used to give 6.5hours+ when it was new.
Only a small problem, it drains around 3% battery overnight and still misses notifications when I check in the morning, while my Honor doesn't even drain a single percent without missing a single notification. It hardly drains 1% sometimes. But this isn't a big issue. Overall, its battery performance is impressive.

> Camera is disappointing. This one has a 50+8+2+2MP camera setup and my Honor has 13+2MP. But they perform almost same. Macro, Ultrawide is useless. UW makes everything grainy. Main camera does well when switched to 50MP mode, otherwise details are same as my Honor. Edge detection is worse than Honor. Takes around 3-4 tries to tap and focus and then it works and still blurs ears and hair. Front camera is fine for the price but the image in viewfinder is too much grainy, it looks like a VGA camera. But after taking picture, it processes and gives far better output. It has an 8MP camera and is on par with my Honor's 24MP camera. If HDR/AI mode isn't turned on, then the selfies are also useless.
AI adds too much over sharpening. However I'm impressed by the night mode. It processes and gives a really appealing result.

> Software is good. I haven't received any ADs yet. I carefully checked the TnC & unticked AD personalizations. Also, I uninstalled all the bloatwares immediately after opening. Only GetApps isn't getting uninstalled/disabled. I've restricted its background processes, notifications etc and it's not bothering me. I had also heard that MIUI has a lot of bugs, but thank god I've not encountered any yet. Also, I love its animations. They're fluid and pleasing. However lags in third party apps are easily noticeable. I don't play games, so can't comment about it. I can say, My Honor phone at 60Hz is smoother in third party apps than this phone's 90Hz. It gets warm at the top when using Twitter/Disney+ Hotstar/SonyLIV/Prime Video and while playing FHD+ or higher resolution videos on any app which was not an issue on my Honor

> Best thing I like about this phone is its dual speakers. It's a pleasure to listen to it. The bass, the treble, the highs and lows are just awesome. It's equally loud as my old LCD TV. After buying this device, I came to know on twitter that this is the only device in that price segment that comes with a balanced stereo speaker.

> Network Reception is good. No proximity sensor issue(as many faced in other Xiaomi devices). 4G+ works fine at my location and easily gets 30Mbps+ speed. Though it supports only B40C(2 or 3 other combos are useless like 1C, 3C because Indian operators don't support them yet) , but at least better than many phones which don't even support CA and are prices higher than this. Only problem is BT & Wi-Fi connectivity. It takes about 40-50 seconds to find a hotspot kept next to it, while it only takes 1-2 seconds in my Honor phone. Sometimes, it doesn't even find it and I have to restart Wi-Fi/BT. This is a bug and I hope it's fixed soon. IR remote works with my TV but only On/Off & volume buttons work. Submitted my TV's model number and I hope they'll fix it.

Overall, this phone isn't upto my expectations. Neither am I completely satisfied with it. But it's a good phone for the price. Not worth a penny more than ₹12,000. If it came for ₹11,499 or less, then it was completely value for money.
Redmi Note 10 was launched around the same price but got a price hike otherwise it was 3 times better option than this."

Camera-
Better camera performance than I expected for this price range. The 8mp Ultra wide cam is a gem. 2mp Macro is useless(for me), the main 50mp is really good for the price and it gives well optimised output. And portrait photos are pretty good too. Videos are not the best.
Performance -
Performs all the jobs pretty clean. Social media browsing all goes smooth... The 90hz display is very good. When it comes to gaming... The G88 is not the best. Honestly gaming is good but not great. I don't recommend it for hardcore gamers.

The phone battery backup is really good . Design was 5 out of 4.5 , But camera back camera is ok in this range but front camera is very low quality picture. If you are a normal user like watching YouTube and Whatsapp use and call u can proceed to purchase . Are you a gamer Don't go for this phone. Overall in my opinion 5 out of 4"
4756,4.0,very nice mobile
4757,4.0,Everything is good but there is so much useful option is not present. Even these options didn't get after few updates.

4774,4.0,Good
4775,4.0, I had many questions in my mind while ordering. But i have reached to this context that this mobile is worthy and suitable to one's finances. This is good and its back looks beautiful and very attractive. The only regret is that adapter of the charger should be included. Camera quality is also good but the portrait does not support selfie. Everything else is satisfying.
4776,4.0,"There are so many apps missing in this phone like there is no Gallary, no files explorer. If you click photo with a slightly zoom then you will get photos like sketch paintings.. Camera is big No... Disappointed with this camera.. If you buy a phone with Rs. 5000/-, photos taken by that phone will also great but this phone sucks..
Required a major Update."
4777,4.0,"Pros -
Smoothness in the performance
Light sensor works good.
Call quality is very good.
Back camera is enough in this price range.

Overall phone is good in this price.

Cons-
I really shocked when I didn't found any option how to change the mode of the phone from Ring, Vibrate, Silent. It worked only using volume keys. There must some options as this option is available in other Realme phones.

I really don't want this feature that when I making it unlock using finger Sensor if at the same time my another finger is at volume button and if both pressed together then it taking screenshot. :("

Such activities are common on amazn sellers. It is advised buy directly from shop."
4819,4.0,the phone has a big issue. it stops responding if someone calls and disconnects it . the phone shows calls going on even though it was hung up by the caller. you need to forcefully restart everytime. this is a issue i discovered after 10 days of purchase and now i can not return it. i will not recommend it to buy this phone.
4820,4.0,In this price range it is a good choice
4821,4.0,"I wanted a cheap second phone as backup/navigation device (which works with Airtel). So I bought this.

Pros
1. Surprisingly fast, Snappy interface, with android go, You think cheap mobile phones will have slow interface, but it is much faster than its Chinese counter parts. (and my primary phone is S22 U)
2. Low bloatware, very less bloatware, nothing you cant remove, after installing few apps I have 23.5GB /32GB storage left after initial setup.
3. Good screen, touch response is good.
4. Small and light phone, with its 5.5 inch screen it is a surprisingly light phone, feel good in hand.
5. Have volte, works with airtel.

Cons.
1. Finding Accessorizes is pain, I had hard time getting a cover or screen protractor for this, no local shop owner keep nokia stuff as it as very low market share.
2. The use of micro usb instead of USB C, This is really bad, it is 2022, this is the worst feature of this phone.
3. Have some software bugs, might be due to slowness, my phone dialer got hanged one time in first day.

Can't Complain.
1. Slow charging, but nothing to complain for such a low price phone.
2. Camera is okish, but again I can't complain, it is not like a feature phone camera, still get a okish sharable photos.
3. Speaker quality is okish, it is audible, nothing great, but again can't complain.

I have not tested multitasking or gaming

Overall if you are looking for a cheap mobile which does everything and take things lightly this might be it."
4822,4.0,Okay.

Useful for everyone...
*Ofcourse, exception for devs & high-end users.
**The reason lies with the Android Version 11 for Nokia C01 Plus phone & got nothing to do with Nokia Co.
***Also, be aware that it's a ""GO EDITION""!

Having said that...
It's 2GB in RAM
& 32 GB as internal storage.

2900MAH battery.
*Charges best with Nokia's or chargers @ par in the said time but a hour to two more with the regular brand.
**Standby time is the greatest of all in the price range. (Pls see it for yourselves if you don't agree). For it's from Sweden's HMD GLOBAL & not from some random LOOT WARE under the VIRUS INCORPORATE from a SA country called POWER GRANDE!
Discharge time too is noticeably good as with the usage.

Net connectivity or processing is more than sufficiently good.

Touch Response is Excellent. Not @ all slow or lagging as said by some. U can correct the touch to speed up or slow down from the accessibility settings.

Display is better. Light weight. Read description for the details.

+ Lightweight.
+Android 11 Go (Not that old version).

4898,5.0,"-Phone runs amazing with the dimensity 810 and I only have praise for the performance
-90Hz refresh rate is eye opening coming from a 60hz phone
-Build is pretty solid and the back has a nice texture that doesnt build up fingerprints much
-Redmi has packed the phone with some neat features such as the IR blaster and the surprisingly amazing DAC which redmi didnt even flex about in the marketing. (my headphones sound miles better out of this phone than my laptop smh)
-Included phone cover is alright and its nice of redmi to throw one in (hole around headphone jack couldve been bigger though as it interferes with any aux cables with chonky housings.)

-Only complaints id have are that the design is kinda mid; doesnt look very amazing, but nothing to complain about either hmhm
-Cannot comment on camera quality as I am a pleb who doesnt know how to nitpick at camera quality :P
-Included screen protector is reaally bad( its only been under a month and there are already scratches around the lower screen where id be typing). So highly recommend peeling it off and taking your chances with the Gorilla Glass or just getting something aftermarket

Overall strongly recommend if you're into a solidly built phone that focuses on getting stuff done rather than sitting around and looking pretty"

What a CRAP this phone is !!!!. Totally not worthy for Rs 22,000/-. The 108 Megapixel camera photo quality is very poor and the vdo shot on this mobile does not give a good vdo, sometime hard to identify clear objects.Its light sensitivity and AI adjustment to light effect is extremely poor. My earlier phone Redmi note 9 pro which cost Rs14000 has 64 megapixel camera is far far better in photo quality and vdo pixel. Also, the youtube vdo watch on this samsung phone got hanged up sometimes and sometimes unable to play it inspite of a good internet connection. I need to restart the phone for re playing the youtube vdo. In my opinion technically this phone should be worth not more than Rs.10,000. Huge amount has been charged by the brand 'Samsung' .What a loss for us !!!"

5003,4.0,The display is amazing. A little downside of this phone is the minor bugs. For instinct your speaker volume gets reduced when some notifications comes.but after notification has gone the speaker sound remain same and does not increase. The better life is moderate and camera quality is good. Although the image you see while taking the photo and image after are completely different. I bought this on a sale at 18k only. worth the money.

Camera for me - Ok
Sound Quality - Great
Worse - There is no 3MM jack. So searching USB type C to 3mm Jack corrector to fit my mic and other devices
Battery - Battery drains very fastly compared to my old samsung M20 . Worse Thing is that Charger is not there. Using my old Samsung Charger. Also the cable supplied has both side Type C.

Before buying pls check whether you are adept in Type C only . Also Charger costs around 1800/-"

5012,4.0,"I am a loyal Samsung mobile user. it's been years, haven't used any other mobile except Samsung ones.
To start with it has a sleek body, look and feel of a high end smart phone
Display is the best thing.
Cam with 108 mega pix - super quality pics.
Same selfie cam but so many features, I like the object eraser feature a lot. as if you have a photoshop program inbuilt in your mobile itself.
rest all is at par.
Con : No provision for audio card input, you have to use wireless headphones!
So sleek and delicate that you need to be careful all the time.

Overall : Loved it ! am writing it after using for more than 4 months. no complaints at all."

5.To take Screenshot it's required Power+Volume button. Different to use Pam swipe inbuilt facilities for screenshot.

7. Initial connection it require near by Wifi Source Comper to my other mobile.."

3.tuch panel is Good.

5.fast charging is not fast charging it takes a lot time.
Overall phone price should be within range of 15 k to 18k but not more than 20k"
5020,4.0,"I like it's design, build quality, bright display ,call quality and camera. The cons are, battery does not last a day with average use. No 3.5mm headphone jack and no stereo speakers. Side mounted FP sensor is old fashioned. I bought this phone because it's a non Chinese phone and Samsung is a trusted brand with best service network.My Samsung M51 with massive battery is still giving flawless service."
5021,4.0,Battery thodi bakar h
5022,4.0,The Samsung Galaxy M53 is a great display phone but rest everything is just an average for the cost....Even you need to buy the phone charger seperately which cost you around Rs. 1300/- for 25 Watt which is not worth as per the charging speed @2022 . Only the display was exceptional but rest other features were just okay.....the heart of this phone which is call processor Mediteck 900 can just handle basic task Without any issues but can't do heavy multitasking and long gaming sessions..... overall this not the packege for any gamers but basic Day to day users.
5023,3.0,Good product
5024,4.0,"All features are good but needs improvement in following aspects..
1.there should have been a short cut for Taking screenshot
2.the feature of blocking unknown and private number is non functional
3.when we click on recent call log then it should also show call history of that contact without any further click"
5025,4.0,"Date of purchase: 26.09.22

Actual Price = 21999 - 2000 (SBI card discount) - 2000 (coupon) = 17999/- = 18000/-
Additional Charges = 1279 (charger) + 500 (c type to 3.5mm connector for your headphone and mic etc.) + 100 (screen guard) + 200 (back case) = 2079/-
Total min. price including all discount: (18000 + 2000) = 20000/-

I wasted very much time finding a case & a 3.5 mm connector. still, the connector is not compatible. this should be provided with a mobile.

General Quality:
Very Slim, Lightweight, best display, screen size is perfect for reading, good finishing, Camera quality is good in this range. elegant look etc.

The main problem is not providing type C to 3.5mm connectors. Due to this, my other accessories like headphones & Mic can not be used with this mobile. case & screen guard should provide. Low performance..."
5026,4.0,"All good. Night mode Camera is average.
But, what's the point in buying without charging adapter. That too a C-Type charging cable comes with both ends C-type.
Have to shed extra 1,500/- for adapter"
5027,4.0,"Best camera, finger print, face lock, display etc but battery 🔋 life not long for 24 hours. Charger not get, other adapter not suit for best charging , it take so many times. Finally I bought an original samsung 25 watt adapter, it's fast"

- Built & design is good

5037,4.0,Display is gorgeous. But the 32 MP front camera is the worst. Its so bad I cant even describe. Dont buy it if you want to click selfies.
5038,4.0,Quality is great .. but it doesn't come with adapter... If you are planning to buy samsung M53 5g..you have to buy adapter seperately
5039,4.0,"The phone is slim which makes it look attractive.
Samsung is the brand so the sensitivity and touch is descent.Expecting a fast sensitivity.No adapter so little to worry here as fast charge would support or not so I am going with 25W adapter only.
Camera is not upto the mark when it talks about 108 MP. Samsung should provide enhancer built in with camera.

5063,4.0,"I'm using this device as a my secondary driver This mobile is best suitable for secondary device only if ur willing to go for Samsung.if ur looking for a all-rounder device then this is not for u.
Display quality is good,there are some bugs which needs to be fixed camera quality is ok.battery is good 👍audio is also ok it doesn't have stereo speakers I didn't face any heating issue processor is also ok ish.Over all its an okish mobile."
5064,4.0,"Mobile is Good for use. But if You camera lovers then. you may feel not a comfort.
1.Battery life is Nice.
2.Touch senser is Good.
3.Display is Very nice.
4.Inbuilt Video recording nice.
5.To take Screenshot it's required Power+Volume button. Different to use Pam swipe inbuilt facilities for screenshot.
6.Camera Performance is average. Image is Blurring If body actions or actities moving normal..
7. Initial connection it require near by Wifi Source Comper to my other mobile.."
5065,4.0,Like
5066,4.0,It is the best mobile device I had ever had.
5067,4.0,"1.both Camera quality must be good in this high range but not.
2.beside battery capacity is 5000 mAH but performance is not so good.
3.tuch panel is Good.
4.sound quality is good in one speaker.
5.fast charging is not fast charging it takes a lot time.
Overall phone price should be within range of 15 k to 18k but not more than 20k"
5068,4.0,"I like it's design, build quality, bright display ,call quality and camera. The cons are, battery does not last a day with average use. No 3.5mm headphone jack and no stereo speakers. Side mounted FP sensor is old fashioned. I bought this phone because it's a non Chinese phone and Samsung is a trusted brand with best service network.My Samsung M51 with massive battery is still giving flawless service."
5069,4.0,Battery thodi bakar h
5070,4.0,The Samsung Galaxy M53 is a great display phone but rest everything is just an average for the cost....Even you need to buy the phone charger seperately which cost you around Rs. 1300/- for 25 Watt which is not worth as per the charging speed @2022 . Only the display was exceptional but rest other features were just okay.....the heart of this phone which is call processor Mediteck 900 can just handle basic task Without any issues but can't do heavy multitasking and long gaming sessions..... overall this not the packege for any gamers but basic Day to day users.
5071,4.0,Good product
5072,4.0,"All features are good but needs improvement in following aspects..
1.there should have been a short cut for Taking screenshot
2.the feature of blocking unknown and private number is non functional
3.when we click on recent call log then it should also show call history of that contact without any further click"
5073,3.0,"Date of purchase: 26.09.22

Actual Price = 21999 - 2000 (SBI card discount) - 2000 (coupon) = 17999/- = 18000/-
Additional Charges = 1279 (charger) + 500 (c type to 3.5mm connector for your headphone and mic etc.) + 100 (screen guard) + 200 (back case) = 2079/-
Total min. price including all discount: (18000 + 2000) = 20000/-

I wasted very much time finding a case & a 3.5 mm connector. still, the connector is not compatible. this should be provided with a mobile.

General Quality:
Very Slim, Lightweight, best display, screen size is perfect for reading, good finishing, Camera quality is good in this range. elegant look etc.

The main problem is not providing type C to 3.5mm connectors. Due to this, my other accessories like headphones & Mic can not be used with this mobile. case & screen guard should provide. Low performance..."
5074,4.0,"All good. Night mode Camera is average.
But, what's the point in buying without charging adapter. That too a C-Type charging cable comes with both ends C-type.
Have to shed extra 1,500/- for adapter"
5075,4.0,"Best camera, finger print, face lock, display etc but battery 🔋 life not long for 24 hours. Charger not get, other adapter not suit for best charging , it take so many times. Finally I bought an original samsung 25 watt adapter, it's fast"
5076,4.0,Good
5077,4.0,"Its been the 2nd day i have been using this phone... The overall phone is average & with way description and phone features are highlighted, it doesn't stand to that good quality vs price.

- Camera not matching 108 Pixels
- Battery 1 Day for average usage. For movies /gaming it won't last more that 1/2 day
- Built & design is good
- Phone screen is not that responsive. Gets stucked sometimes.."
5078,4.0,I liked the colour ...camera was good
5079,4.0,Sometimes phone is hang this is an only issue
5080,4.0,Sidemounted fingerprint is good battery gets drain for heavy usage user friendly.
5081,4.0,Looks like classy specially back panel.Fingure print should be in screen.Then this would beat any phone ranges between 30 to 35k.
5082,4.0,"I'm using this phone from around 15 days...what I experienced I'm writing....display is beautiful...camera is descent ,not super...but many inbuilt camera features are there that helps a lot to edit pics....after tempered glass , sometimes touch doesn't respond on time...don't know why...speaker is ok...price is high because samsung has its brand value...other brands also providing same features in less amount...battery is also average...Software experience is good with UI 4...let's see how it behaves in long run."
5083,4.0,"The look is very good, camera quality is quite good and the performance is also quite good. The nfc is not there in the phone and that is the bad thing."
5084,4.0,Exchange of my old phone amount was too low
5085,4.0,Display is gorgeous. But the 32 MP front camera is the worst. Its so bad I cant even describe. Dont buy it if you want to click selfies.
5086,4.0,Quality is great .. but it doesn't come with adapter... If you are planning to buy samsung M53 5g..you have to buy adapter seperately
5087,4.0,"The phone is slim which makes it look attractive.
Samsung is the brand so the sensitivity and touch is descent.Expecting a fast sensitivity.No adapter so little to worry here as fast charge would support or not so I am going with 25W adapter only.
Camera is not upto the mark when it talks about 108 MP. Samsung should provide enhancer built in with camera.
Budgeted phone overall."
5088,4.0,Good in performance after software update
5089,4.0,"Samsung m53 mobile ka touch Achha nhi he. Bar bar touch krne pr bhi kam nhi krta.
Bettery life b kam he din bhar bina use krne pr bhi kam ho jati he."

Misses on the wide angle lens and the camera quality is good for normal pics. Videos and nightography is pathetic. Macro is surprisingly great! Overall average camera.

Battery is above average with around 9 hrs screen time at 60 Hz and around 7.5 with 90 Hz refresh rate.

Performance is the best for the price... Snapdragon 480 ~ Snapdragon 600 series

5382,4.0,"Bought this phone recently. I got it for 6759/- something, basically under 7k. MRP was 9,999/- + I've exchanged my Redmi 7 for 2600. Felt like a fair deal to me. Now let's get to the phone part.
See,this is a decent phone if you are planning to buy it for parents,or for yourself. Make sure you buy it under 10k.
If you can exchange,do that. But if you are looking for a phone in 11-12k, I'd suggest,go for Realme Narzo 50. It's better in terms of charging (33W),in hand feel is same I'd say,but the processor is better as well (G95) compared to Redmi 10 Prime (G88).
Nevertheless,if you want this phone only,here are a couple of things you should know about it.
Camera:- Decent. The Color reproduction is good. Don't expect much from dark mode,but in good daylight conditions,with the 50 MP main sensor, you'd get detailed photos. Selfie is decent as well,as you expect from 10-15k smartphones.

Processor:- Good enough,no major heating issues,plus it is superior compared to the generic Snapdragon 680 which every smartphone company is using these days. HDR content is supported on YouTube. The only con G88 has compared to the Snapdragon 680 is the battery life,since the latter is 6 nm based,and the former is 12nm. But you don't have to worry about it,since it has 6000 mAh battery packed inside.
Feel:- The phone is thick on paper,like really thick,but you won't feel the thickness while holding it. It could've been slimmer but this is what we get. The vibration motor is good enough,not smooth like Z- Axis in some Redmi smartphones,but you can change the intensity and you are good to go.

Display:- The display is good and big enough. It has a full HD IPS panel,and a good one. Viewing content on Netflix and Prime Video is good. Supports Widevine L1 as well. The refresh rate is good. I felt it. It might not be as smooth in some third party apps like Reddit or twitter but it's smooth in the UI. It has a punch hole display which is rare in this price range.

Software:- It runs on Android 11,and MIUI 12.5,which is a bummer. I can bear Android 11 at this price range,but they should have at least given MIUI 13. 12.5 gets the job done too,but it's not as polished,plus the animations are limited. Like when you close the app,you don't get the animation and it closes abruptly. Apart from that,no bugs found yet. No screen flickering issue in low brightness. Nothing of that sort. I hate to say it,but I am kind of liking MIUI,only because of the familiarity of it. Everyone has once used a MI phone in their life,so it feels like a familiar territory.

Battery and Charging:- As I previously stated,it has 6000 mAh battery which lasts longer. You can easily get upto 1.5-2 days on normal usage.
Charger is 22.5 W inside the box,but the phone supports 18W. So,you can charge the phone in almost 2 hours,from 0. No complains there.

Conclusion:- So,this is all you need to know about the phone. I recommend it,but make sure you get it under 10k. If not,go for POCO M4 Pro,or Realme Narzo 50. You could get it around 12k. They are superior in most of the aspects than Redmi 10 Prime. Thank you for reading,hope that helped.
And if some of you are curious about 2021 and 2022 version of 10 Prime, don't worry. They are exactly the same.

Edit:- Surprisingly,it has got MIUI 13, Android 12 based in November. Just wanted to let you guys know."
5383,4.0,"Used this phone for a week and here's my initial experience with this phone :

> My previous phone was Honor 10 Lite which I bought for ₹7,999 in 2019. Now this Redmi 10 Prime which I bought for ₹11,999 doesn't seem to be a big upgrade.

> Display is good and almost same as my previous phone except for the 90Hz display which is kind of useless. Lags a lot while scrolling in Twitter, YouTube, etc. while my Honor doesn't. In 60Hz, it's fine. So for me, 90Hz is just a gimmick.

> 6000mAh Battery is too good. Lasts for 2 days without recharging with 9Hours+ SOT. My Honor has a 3400mAh battery and it used to give 6.5hours+ when it was new.
Only a small problem, it drains around 3% battery overnight and still misses notifications when I check in the morning, while my Honor doesn't even drain a single percent without missing a single notification. It hardly drains 1% sometimes. But this isn't a big issue. Overall, its battery performance is impressive.

> Camera is disappointing. This one has a 50+8+2+2MP camera setup and my Honor has 13+2MP. But they perform almost same. Macro, Ultrawide is useless. UW makes everything grainy. Main camera does well when switched to 50MP mode, otherwise details are same as my Honor. Edge detection is worse than Honor. Takes around 3-4 tries to tap and focus and then it works and still blurs ears and hair. Front camera is fine for the price but the image in viewfinder is too much grainy, it looks like a VGA camera. But after taking picture, it processes and gives far better output. It has an 8MP camera and is on par with my Honor's 24MP camera. If HDR/AI mode isn't turned on, then the selfies are also useless.
AI adds too much over sharpening. However I'm impressed by the night mode. It processes and gives a really appealing result.

> Software is good. I haven't received any ADs yet. I carefully checked the TnC & unticked AD personalizations. Also, I uninstalled all the bloatwares immediately after opening. Only GetApps isn't getting uninstalled/disabled. I've restricted its background processes, notifications etc and it's not bothering me. I had also heard that MIUI has a lot of bugs, but thank god I've not encountered any yet. Also, I love its animations. They're fluid and pleasing. However lags in third party apps are easily noticeable. I don't play games, so can't comment about it. I can say, My Honor phone at 60Hz is smoother in third party apps than this phone's 90Hz. It gets warm at the top when using Twitter/Disney+ Hotstar/SonyLIV/Prime Video and while playing FHD+ or higher resolution videos on any app which was not an issue on my Honor

> Best thing I like about this phone is its dual speakers. It's a pleasure to listen to it. The bass, the treble, the highs and lows are just awesome. It's equally loud as my old LCD TV. After buying this device, I came to know on twitter that this is the only device in that price segment that comes with a balanced stereo speaker.

> Network Reception is good. No proximity sensor issue(as many faced in other Xiaomi devices). 4G+ works fine at my location and easily gets 30Mbps+ speed. Though it supports only B40C(2 or 3 other combos are useless like 1C, 3C because Indian operators don't support them yet) , but at least better than many phones which don't even support CA and are prices higher than this. Only problem is BT & Wi-Fi connectivity. It takes about 40-50 seconds to find a hotspot kept next to it, while it only takes 1-2 seconds in my Honor phone. Sometimes, it doesn't even find it and I have to restart Wi-Fi/BT. This is a bug and I hope it's fixed soon. IR remote works with my TV but only On/Off & volume buttons work. Submitted my TV's model number and I hope they'll fix it.

Overall, this phone isn't upto my expectations. Neither am I completely satisfied with it. But it's a good phone for the price. Not worth a penny more than ₹12,000. If it came for ₹11,499 or less, then it was completely value for money.
Redmi Note 10 was launched around the same price but got a price hike otherwise it was 3 times better option than this."

Camera-
Better camera performance than I expected for this price range. The 8mp Ultra wide cam is a gem. 2mp Macro is useless(for me), the main 50mp is really good for the price and it gives well optimised output. And portrait photos are pretty good too. Videos are not the best.
Performance -
Performs all the jobs pretty clean. Social media browsing all goes smooth... The 90hz display is very good. When it comes to gaming... The G88 is not the best. Honestly gaming is good but not great. I don't recommend it for hardcore gamers.
Battery-
Its amazing. 6000mah perfect👌 Lasts a whole day without any problem. And 22.5W charger provided even phone only supports 18W thats good to see.

Sometimes, it doesn't even find it and I have to restart Wi-Fi/BT. This is a bug and I hope it's fixed soon. IR remote works with my TV but only On/Off & volume buttons work. Submitted my TV's model number and I hope they'll fix it.

Overall, this phone isn't upto my expectations. Neither am I completely satisfied with it. But it's a good phone for the price. Not worth a penny more than ₹12,000. If it came for ₹11,499 or less, then it was completely value for money.
Redmi Note 10 was launched around the same price but got a price hike otherwise it was 3 times better option than this."

5453,4.0,"I really recommend this phone to anyone who needs a good phone for normal daily tasks. If you get this below Rs. 10k its a steal👍
Camera-
Better camera performance than I expected for this price range. The 8mp Ultra wide cam is a gem. 2mp Macro is useless(for me), the main 50mp is really good for the price and it gives well optimised output. And portrait photos are pretty good too. Videos are not the best.
Performance -
Performs all the jobs pretty clean. Social media browsing all goes smooth... The 90hz display is very good. When it comes to gaming... The G88 is not the best. Honestly gaming is good but not great. I don't recommend it for hardcore gamers.
Battery-
Its amazing. 6000mah perfect👌 Lasts a whole day without any problem. And 22.5W charger provided even phone only supports 18W thats good to see.

I recommend this over the new Redmi 11 SE(Note 10s without charger)."

5486,4.0,"Awesome product.... Worth every penny... My son even tried to knock it off the dash during my run..... Holded hard enough......the product is doing well even when i use multiple cars. I used it on my nexon, tigor, linea, spresso.. After going through 100s of products available online, I went for this as it had a decent rating and more importantly was not magnet based. Though the manufacturers claim that the magnet based holders do not damage the phone, expert opinion points at least the compass in the phone being affected (and the main purpose of me using the holder would be to use while viewing maps - with a defective compass that would not be possible).
Installation: very very easy to install. Has two locking options based on the size of the air vent. There is a nut on the backside using which one can adjust how easy/hard it should be to change the angle. I like mine to be fixee and it works fine.
Grip: is good and over normal city driving in Bangalore (meaning a lot of potholes and bad roads), the phone was held firmly. The cushion in the holder helps. One push release makes it very easy to use.
Only con so far is that there is a slight rattle in the car after fixing it. Need to check if I can eliminate this Awesome product.... Worth every penny..1. Can be clamped / unclamped onto any vent as and when required. 2. Very sturdy and tight fitting which holds mobile even in the worst jerks / bumps. 3. Size is perfect. Neither too big, nor too small. 4. Better than the traditional sticky/suction fitting like many dashboard/glass mobile holders which tend to become loose after a certain period of time, or can get even get opened from heavy jerks. 5. Chose not to go for magnetic holders as the magnet power might reduce over time. Very happy with the product and would definitely recommend to everyone.

5496,4.0,Good Quality
5497,4.0,Good product.
5498,4.0,"The products itself is sturdy and well built.
However it depends on the ac vent if it will hold the phone upright.
If you phone is a bit heavy, this will just pull down the ac vent’s blades along with it and not stay upright.

I worked around it by fixing it on the last vent blade so that the clip gets jammed in the last section and there is no room for the blade to move down."
5499,4.0,I received the product with broken packaging. The entire box was torned. I checked for the product inside it was working fine so i kept it.
5500,4.0,"Works as expected, strength and usefulness still to be explored as didn't get chance to drive much"
5501,4.0,Material is good quality
5502,4.0,Good product at reasonable price. Sturdy and It’s easy to install/remove. Plastic is of good quality with good fit and finish. Rating 4 because the fixing of it on certain ac vents will be tough especially the middle ones. Like it was in my case for Suzuki Baleno. In Central ac vent I couldn’t fix it straight but on driver side one it was fine.
5503,4.0,Holding power got loose after few days
5504,4.0,Posting this review after having used the product for over a year. I have a Samsung A31 and bought this holder for it. This fits perfectly in the air vents and holds itself and the mobile even on bad or rough roads. If flexible enough so you can adjust according to your requirement.

5514,4.0,"Clamp is strong. Don't keep removing it n putting, else it will get loose. Fix it once n leave it. Product is sturdy. If you have movable vent then it will get closed due to phone weight. Good for fixed non movable air vents"

5523,4.0,"Nice product, worthy & valuble"
5524,5.0,"Build quality is superb... Locks in place on the vent & doesn't move even a mm..
But in spite of this, the entire mount vibrates a lot due to it being on a flap of an AC vent, which sadly isn't stationary.
Sadly this Can/Might damage the electronic image stabilization components of the cellphone camera.
Basic entry-level smarts phones need not worry about it though.

Secondly, although the grip on the phone is adequate, sometimes it feels that the cellphone might slip out of it while the vehicle is going fast over a bump or speedbreaker.
I feel the clamp should either be re-designed as a jaw mechanism or else at least a retaining rubber should be provided in the box(the ones with slots to hook up in the cellphone edges).

Apart from this one major gripe.. This product is brilliant!!
If one isn't bothered the above mentioned issues, go ahead and buy/use this product without fear. It's a Total Value For Money item!!"

5617,3.0,I am really impressed with this product. The magnet provides such good coupling that the phone stays intact even during light offroading scenarios.

A must buy product for anyone who uses wired versions of Android auto / Apple carplay or Google maps while driving .

5624,4.0,"Excellent suction power and So tiny its fits perfectly in my car. so far Drove 1200+ KM so far with this excellent product.

5638,5.0,"Just go by the installation procedure given by the product manufacturers which is available in youtube.

5683,5.0,"The quality of the product is really nice and it comes with two metal pieces that go inside your mobile cover so that it could stick to the magnet attached on your car. I found the phone would still tilt a little or slightly move across an angle every time the car hit a bump on the road.

5684,5.0,Overpriced
5685,5.0,The Best Magnetic Air Vent Phone Holder with best Magnetic Hold !
5686,4.0,The product is of high quality and magnetic power is more than adequate. Reviews with video showing the phone falling off is not accurate. You have to stick the plates they gave in the phone back cover and then the magnetic power starts to work. I’m more than happy with the product.
5687,5.0,Meets expectation. Easy to attach. Easy to detach.
5688,5.0,Worth every buck… as always!
5689,5.0,"The device does what it says.
1.Has good adhesion
2.sturdy hold even on bad roads (did himachal north east india trip,at no place mobile [ iphone 11 pro with case] fell.

problem:
After doing about 7000 kms,the rubber grip has started chipping off.I fevi-quicked the rubber cladding."
5690,5.0,Great product and it’s we easy to use in car as well. The phone doesn’t sway a lot due to the strong magnet power.
5691,5.0,"This product works really well. One can buy it with eyes closed

It can be fitted on an ac vent and moved different places and adjusted completely.

Really happy.

PS: doesn't come out with road bumps or vibration"
5692,4.0,"I luv this product. 4magnest hold ur phone quite sturdily and it fits perfectly onto ur ac vent. Have been jst a week since i purchased this holder so far sooo gud.
Although the only cons are
1. Limited to the mobiles to which u stick the meal pads(usually 2)
2. Since its in the ac vent obviously it affect the ventilation a bit."
5693,5.0,"I do not have flat surface in my car's dashboard, ordered this product with more expectations and it exceeded all my expectation, easy to use, powerful magnet and sticks to vents very well. Totally happy with the purchase."
5694,4.0,Built solid and very sturdy. Serves its purpose well. Ordering another one.
5695,5.0,Easy to use
5696,5.0,"Good product. For dummies first attach the metal plate to your phone case and then use it on the magnet. With the metal plate on the case, you can't do wireless charging (obviously). It holds the phone in position and is quite sturdy. For city use its perfect and convenient. Galaxy s22 ultra is quite a heavy phone and the product does a good job in handling its weight.
Note: I'm putting this review after using this product for almost 1 month.. so far so good."
5697,5.0,It works really well & has a really strong magnetic grip in it.
5698,4.0,The phone holding is so perfect it holds phone very bumpy bumpy road
5699,5.0,"Its good and my mobile IPhoneXR doesn’t fall off. BUT, Putting/sticking any, I mean any metallic Object like this spigen on Mobile back cover increases Mobile Radiation more than permitted/allowed Range (we call it as SAR Value)."
5700,5.0,Very powerful magnet
5701,5.0,"I broke my plastic air vent flaps while installing on those. I managed to attach it in the end but one flap is gone in the process. Also when I attach the phone on it there is no air flow from that vent as can be expected. That can be very annoying on very hot days. I have experienced it. Next time I will go for some other type of mount. May be on wind shield. On new expensive car I will not advise this product. Risk of damage to air vent flaps is too high.

Other wise product is very sturdy. Magnate is very powerful. And adhesive used for magnate is by 3M which is a gold standard."
5702,5.0,"Using this for my TATA Nexon ev max and it has a very strong magnet, works well but there is this fitting sort of issue, like the plough is hard to install in Ac vent and when we fix it and further place our phone onto it. We have to make it horizontal rather than vertical. Because ac vents are little deep."
5703,5.0,"Everything is good except that it bocks the ac vent. It holds good, sufficient enough for almost all bumpy roads. And will last long unlike the suction type"
5704,3.0,"It's very good and suit for my beat car. I sue ""nothing phone 1"" which is heavier than any other phones, yet it sit will with powerful magnets.... Go ahead. It's good and comfortable for navigation"
5705,5.0,Works fine
5706,5.0,Overall good product
5707,3.0,Product is good however it's not advisable to use in cars where it fits only on vents near doors. The mobile light creates reflection on ORVM it causes losing view of vehicles in ORVM. Not good to compromise safety. Hence not recommended for Maruti Ertiga
5708,5.0,Rubber quality is not good
5709,5.0,Rubber is moving out in first use only
5710,5.0,Very good mount for phone for unobtrusive viewing as well as keep the device cool during use.
5711,3.0,"Great grip, great look, very useful"
5712,4.0,"Gud product, but it block air flow and air flow only upward site"
5713,4.0,"After surfing along a lot of mobile holders for my city 2012 I selected this. And I was a great fan of spigen for a very long time. The product was so good comes in a compact size with great suction power. But sadly it doesn't fit properly in my center AC vents due to the dashboard design of my vehicle. But it fits perfectly in my right AC vent.

Pros:
1. The suction was good enough with the metal plates and I didn't experience any fall till now even in the average pothole roads.
2. The slim and sleek design does not damage the AC vents and the rubber grip holds firmly without any loose fits.
3. Fits for all types of phones a bit heavier models too.

Cons:
1. A bit costly.
2. Will affect the AC flow of that particular vent. But I didn't experience a major difference."
5714,5.0,Liked the product very much . I am writing this review after its usage. I have installed it in Hyundai Verna fluidic 2013 model. It fits perfectly in horizontal AC vents and mix with the black background easily such that it’s hard to find it in one shot. Suction power is great and it will hold ur phone perfectly even in rough rides
5715,3.0,"Good quality, can go for it."
5716,5.0,"Using this product from last couple of weeks, the holding capacity of the mobile excellent and not reduced the magnetic power after multiple usage. Godd product for less money."
5717,4.0,Does what shown in the description. Good one
5718,5.0,चिपकता बहुत जोर से लाइक पकड़े रखना
5719,3.0,
5720,4.0,Excellent product
5721,4.0,"I bought it for holding my iPhone in my car while using map. One, be careful while fixing it to your AC vent. A slight mistake can damage the levers in AC vent. Two, it doesn't hold the phones with cases. You need to remove the case. Third, it could not hold my iPhone. It was sliding down. Be aware of these limitations before you buy."
5722,4.0,"It’s a great and possibly best quality product. Two metal strips are provided that makes much sense and are useful.
I pasted the metal strips on phone back cover instead of the phone so that I can safely remove the strips when I change my phone. This worked well. However, I stare at ugly gluey surface instead of spigen logo. But that’s ok.

One important point is that it will not fit all cars - specially when there is a raised area around the AC vent, in that case the phone does not reach the magnet properly and prone to falls on turns and brakes."
5723,4.0,"Does the job pretty well. Good holding power. Can sustain the usual sudden breaks and speed breakers without mobile falling off. Good quality. Easy application.
Go for it."
5724,4.0,strong hold
5725,5.0,The magnets are really good and keeps the phone upright even on bumpy roads.
5726,5.0,Good product. Stands by the claims given by the manufacturer. My car vents are not in a position as facing the driver. This makes the phone not facing and a bit difficult to use. Product but is very good.
5727,5.0,The holder is cool looking but phone tends to fall off when there is any type of vibration due to rough or uneven roads.
5728,5.0,"I've tried a handful of mobile mounts and had given up on it, cuz of the following reasons
1) they're a bit clumsy
2) the suction cups eventually fail
3) they're too bulky
4) if you got a pothole, chances are your precious phone will land at your feet.

This mount, solves all the above problem and is a minimalistic solution. I absolutely love this.

The best part about this mount would btle the ability to use the phone in traffic and just stick it back to the magnet within 2-3 seconds when the light turns green."
5729,4.0,My iPhone 13 kept dropping of the holder over road rumblers and speed breakers

5771,4.0,Excellent product
5772,4.0,"I bought it for holding my iPhone in my car while using map. One, be careful while fixing it to your AC vent. A slight mistake can damage the levers in AC vent. Two, it doesn't hold the phones with cases. You need to remove the case. Third, it could not hold my iPhone. It was sliding down. Be aware of these limitations before you buy."
5773,4.0,"It’s a great and possibly best quality product. Two metal strips are provided that makes much sense and are useful.
I pasted the metal strips on phone back cover instead of the phone so that I can safely remove the strips when I change my phone. This worked well. However, I stare at ugly gluey surface instead of spigen logo. But that’s ok.

One important point is that it will not fit all cars - specially when there is a raised area around the AC vent, in that case the phone does not reach the magnet properly and prone to falls on turns and brakes."
5774,4.0,"Does the job pretty well. Good holding power. Can sustain the usual sudden breaks and speed breakers without mobile falling off. Good quality. Easy application.
Go for it."
5775,5.0,strong hold
5776,5.0,The magnets are really good and keeps the phone upright even on bumpy roads.
5777,5.0,Good product. Stands by the claims given by the manufacturer. My car vents are not in a position as facing the driver. This makes the phone not facing and a bit difficult to use. Product but is very good.
5778,5.0,The holder is cool looking but phone tends to fall off when there is any type of vibration due to rough or uneven roads.
5779,4.0,"I've tried a handful of mobile mounts and had given up on it, cuz of the following reasons
1) they're a bit clumsy
2) the suction cups eventually fail
3) they're too bulky
4) if you got a pothole, chances are your precious phone will land at your feet.

This mount, solves all the above problem and is a minimalistic solution. I absolutely love this.

The best part about this mount would btle the ability to use the phone in traffic and just stick it back to the magnet within 2-3 seconds when the light turns green."
5780,5.0,My iPhone 13 kept dropping of the holder over road rumblers and speed breakers

5789,3.0,"The functionality is good. 2 things i didn't like too much:
1. When there is no phone in the holder, there is quite a bit of rattling.
2. Apart from the suction, they have provided an adhesive on the cup. This provides a solid grip on any surface. But when left in hot sun on the dashboard, the adhesive melts (it happened with my earlier holder) and then it becomes a nightmare to get off.

5880,4.0,"Truly a segment killer. Prior to buying this, given I was very sceptical about spending so much on earphones, I didn't know for sure if this was a good decision.

My options were either the the torq from crossbeats/ JBL 230anc and the Sony c500.

Having owned a crossbeats enigma already, I figured it was time to try something new. The JBL branding alone got my attention. Did my research and saw that most of the comparisons drawn for this model was with the 230 variant of the same series. The fact that this had a 10mm driver as opposed to the 6mm driver on the 230 already had me plus that was a pricier option. Again, the driver size doesn't always determine the sound quality or quantity but the JBL branding wasn't really seen on those out of the box. Some reviews state thats louder. Idk how. And the fit also seems better with the 230. This however has JBL branding proudly etheched on them.

Let's talk about the important bits.
> Fit.😶‍🌫️
Everyone's complaining about the comfort wearing them and how it's always coming off. This really just comes down to the rubber buds you use. Find something that's appropriate for your ears. The stock options didn't fit me but I have a bunch of buds from all my previous earphones so found one that fits me like a charm. Problem solved.

>Sound quality 🥵🥵
My dudes, hear me out when I say this. JBL brings it's own quality to music when it comes to their devices.
>Soundstage 🥵
The output for the 130anc is simply unmatched given the price segment. You can hear the sound so clearly seperated from various devices if you're an audiophile.
> Bass. 🤙🏽
Incredible. So booming. So unhindered. And all this without compromising on the vocals. The Equalizer option is such a blessing.
> Connectivity. ❤️
It searches for your phones Bluetooth the second it's out of the box. Never once did I have to open Bluetooth menu to connect.
> Volume.👍🏼 This is my only gripe. Hence the 4 stars. At full volume, you won't find yourself needing any more volume but you'd prefer if there was more in the tank 😉
So most of the time if you're gonna be using it at full volume to get the full feel of the JBL ANC 130. This too can easily be fixed by having external apps like a sound booster but for a normal person, it's absolutely unnecessary. I have higher volume requirements cuz I primarily use these buds at the gym.
> ANC.🙄 Okay another gripe but hey, at this price point that too from JBL, you're really not buying these for ANC. Like most others say here, the difference with ANC turned on and off is negligible.
> Battery. 🦍
I still don't know how these buds give over the head headphone level battery life.
Not only is the case super packed with a solid battery, the buds are optimized to deliver on a solid 8 hour battery despite playing music with such excellence at high volumes. Used the buds for an hour starting with 100% each and it was down to 90% after. 🥸
The JBL app precisely shows the battery left on each individual bud along with how much the case has left.
> Microphone.
The 4 mics on this really goes a long way. Despite other reviews that say it's not that good, I find it super impressive. It has a way of picking your voice even in loud environments. 5/5 for indoor calling. 4/5 for outdoor calling. And. For those wondering if ANC works during calls, it doesn't. You also have an option with the app that can determine how much of your own voice you hear when on call. 🙇 ( If outdoor calling is your priority, I'd recommend the 230 ANC cuz the design will better pick your voice)
Plus points
Talk through mode- double tap on the left bud and it'll enable talk through mode. Brings the music down so low so you don't have to take them off your ear should you need to talk to someone.
Design. So premium.
Case. Premium case. I'd recommend buying a seperate case protector too.

TDLR, unrivalled performance at this price point. I wouldn't be surprised if this can compete with buds priced @8-10k. Unmatched bass. Solid battery life. Poor ANC but who cares."
5881,3.0,"Let's talk about elephant in the room :
1) are they great, answer is : no.
2) are they good enough : maybe
3) but can they be made great doing some modifications : yes and no

Edited comment : (Given four stars earlier, reducing to 3 stars because I completed stopped using this as cons overshadowed the pros. It's unbearable now.)

Note : I am audiophile, so sound quality is important too me.
I have been using this earphone for month now , so lets list pros and cons.

Pros :
1) these are best for music listening ,hear me out only for music listening.
2) Battery is really really great (10/10) it's really really really really good.
3) build quality is good
4) app provided by JBL is really damn impressive
(This is where the 3rd point comes , where you can make them great by doing modification for voice).
5) it's overall good sounding earphones
6) microphone quality is good.

Let's talk about the
I am using for 1 month ,these cons will be good starting point for those who want to buy it.

Cons :
1) app sometimes don't work , I have to put by buds back in my case and then take it out , reconnect to keep app working. ( Sometimes annoys me)

2) fit in ear : I am never satisfied with the fit in the ear there is always in back of my mind that they are going to fall but they don't , but over time it actually really annoys I person to alway think that they are going to fall, bear in mind I am using for month ,it is not nice feeling to have that ear phone is always going to fall.

3) (only applicable when watching video)
lets talk about sound quality , I don't know this is me only or not but I have used various earphones, neckbands and headphones in past but never faced this issue in the past . The issue is the loundness in vocals is really loud some times , what I mean to say is if I am watching some movie and somebody shouts it just becomes too loud(for me) I have earphones called : sony MDR - XB55AP, never faced this specific issue with them.

4) vocal sync/lips sync problem : at start of video it takes 1,2 secs to lip sync with the video which is really annoying sometimes. It happening all the time, when I start the video, when I pause and play the video when new episode starts . This is a problem.(as video continues it becames fine, there is no more lip sync , it's only when video is started or paused and played again)

5) most of the problem with this earphone is with watching the videos : lip sync issue at start of video, sudden loudness when somebody shouts (this is so random that it becomes noticable)

Now you remember that I told you these issues can be solved and this earphone can be made great , yes we can do that by JBL headphone app.
You can fine tune your equaliser at solve loudness issue. You can switch the type to video type to make lip sync issue gone.

By app you can make this a great earphone but the problem is that they should not be dependent on app to be great. For example I have a Bluetooth tv so this earphone can connect to TV but because this app is not available for TVs it just do not perform that well . But if you are going to use mobile phones and tablets then you can make them great.

At this price point they are good like 7/10 ,but not great like 10/10. Seen quite a few better sounding earphones in thile past not like these are bad but they are 7/10 ,lets be most generous : 7.5/10"
5882,3.0,"Pros -
* The audio quality is super. No complaints.
Rich Bass. You can even set what you want on the JBL app if you want more vocals or more bass. Even if you want to customise it, you can customise it.
*The battery life is great. It's been over a month and I charged it like only 2-3 times. You can easily expect 20-30 of hours of usage without ANC on
* The JBL app provides you many features also there is fast pair which enables you to connect without even turning on bluetooth
*Find my earbuds is another feature
Cons - These cons are actually my expectations but these are not there in any headphones in this price
*The ANC is just worthy for the price and not something which is there on 10k-20k earphones. There is a difference when you turn on and turn off the ANC but its very little. And I turn it off always because I feel it's a waste of battery
* No multiple connections - You need to disconnect one device to connect it to other
*Find my earbuds works only when bluetooth is connected"
5883,4.0,"This the best bass and noise cancellation Earbuds you can get at this price range (I bought this when this was around 5K).

Sound quality is great and is surprisingly at a level almost to my 9K rupees JBL LIVE650BTNC headphones, GREAT.

I'm not a heavy user of Earbuds, so for me it's lasting more than a week on a single charge. So if you are a normal user who won't use these for a whole day, u can go a whole week without charging it.

Touch controls are very good but you will get a little annoyed if mistouch happens a lot.

One thing I didn't like is the transition sound it makes when I turn on/off noise cancellation. It makes a loud sound before switching from ambient aware or talkthru and I tried lowering it's volume by decreasing the volume of the music, but it didn't work. It's a very loud sound when compared to an average music volume most of the people listen to.

NOTE- ""THIS IS NOT A WATER PROOF EARBUDS"""
5884,4.0,"This is my first ANC feature product. I find this feature very useful especially during travelling. Battery backup is huge and can manage moderate usage 6hrs/day for 4 days easily, much helpful for long train jrnys. JBL is providing amazing features at very decent price. Case quality is just okay, I was expecting it little better. I was using Sony MDR XB50BS earlier, which has amazing Bass & very high volume levels where you can hear even the feable background instruments clearly. It didn't had ANC & was wired backhead. Compared to that, jbl could improve sound quality going forward"
5885,4.0,"Fit - excellent
Sound - Blows ur mind
App - Easy and usefull
Overall performance - Fantastic
I purchased 130NC during Amazon GIF and got a fab deal at 3599.
I've used other great TWS brands but this one is a clear winner 🏆 considering overall performance.
Just one small complaint - The call quality could be better. The person on the other end can hear you clearly even in very noisy environment as the focus is your voice but background noise is very evident.
Overall
Go for it ... You won't regret the buy and you'll love the experience."
5886,5.0,"I bought these earphones in amazone sale. The delivery and packing was good. Moving to product , following are pros and cons of it
Pros:
1. Sound quality: It has good sound quality with a dedicated app to adjust the earphones for different audio quality configuration
2.Quick connect and range: It quickly connects with your device and does provide long range for Bluetooth connectivity
3: Light weight: Its quite light in weight which enables you to wear it for long time

Cons:
1: poor fit: Though the product is meant to fit snuggly in the ear, it does not provide great fit. You will always feel that they will pop out any time.
2. ANC: Despite have ANC feature,it does not provide high quality noise cancellation even for rhythmic noise like sound of rain or ceiling fan which it is supposed to suppress
3.Call quality: JBL claims to provide superior call quality but it does provide it only in quiet places. In crowded place with surrounding noise,it somehow transfers surrounding noise more than the callers voice. I have to unplug my earphones during calls as people at the other end complaint about surrounding noise. It should at least be able to provide call quality which you get with normal phone call using phones microphones"
5887,3.0,"The tws have really good audio quality for the price, the high, mids and lows are very clear, and you can adjust them using the JBL Headphones app.
The ANC is okay considering the price, so don't expect it to cancel all frequencies, it just cancels fan or air conditioner's level ambient sound. The ambient mode is quite helpful and work fine.
However, I expected the case to be built more sturdier as it lacks tightness at the hinges. The battery life is about 36 hours without ANC at 40% volume.
My least favorite thing about these is the range which is fine only up to a few meters with no obstruction, so the moment you step out of you room, it disconnects which was not expected considering BT 5.3 and it also becomes annoying sometimes. Also, they comfortable but they fall out pretty easily so keep these 2 in mind while buying.
Bought it for 3800/- so don't have many complains !"
5888,5.0," Bought these yesterday (Sale) for around 3400/- after all the bank offers.
Seriously thought of buying JBl for so long but they were always at the range of 5000(the good ones with touch controls)
So this deal looked very tempting and I went for it
First impressions:
The case looked okay-ish in the photos but trust me it feels so classic hands on.It looks class &Matty (mine is black). Coming to the buds I've heard so much about the misfits in the ear..I'm still trying to figure out how to wear them comfortably but if you are someone sitting at your desk/lying on your bed, watching a movie or something,they won't bother you at all. I bought these for that so i felt comfortable.The range is so good. I used Noise tws earlier but these Have almost double the range of Noise.
The app: Cool features...the only thing I felt a bit not cool is that the touch controls are preset..i.e you'll have to choose between 3 preset features 1.Volume 2.music change 3.Anc you can opt one for each bud but the other will be left out. So I left out Anc and assigned volume to my Right bud and music control to my left bud. They should have allowed to include all three.
Apart from that you can control ANC from the app..the ambient aware and talk through modes are amazing and new to be honest.
Hey i got these for 3400 I'm not gonna complain at all! Totally satisfied..and the SOUND: WELL ITS JBL so the BASS is booming and the Equalizer in the app lets you change the moods to vocals/jazz/club or you can even create your own Equalizer modes. So ITSALL GOODMAN. IF YOU ARE GETTING THESE FOR LESS THAN 4K YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY GO FORWARD. Coz afterall it's JBL!"
5889,4.0,"The product doesn't promise ultra level quality but it's decent for what you are paying, personally I am satisfied, it has good amount of everything but the ANC here is just a gimmick, it does nothing. So don't buy if you are after Anc but for a decent sound quality and good calling mic you can consider, I haven't tried the high end product like sony so i can't make a comparison but to me it's decent, sound stage is also good, it is loud and you can modify sound signature with the app too. Yes of course the app needs a bit of tuning it did give me connectivity issue when I first bought and tried to update. But after some trial I managed to update the firmware. For a non specific user it will sure give you enjoyment listening"
5890,4.0,Good sound . I have only one issue . Case lid its have some wrong . While closing lid feel tight
5891,4.0,Good sound quality but noise cancellation not as per expections.
5892,5.0,This product is very nice. The quality of sound is very nice.The noise cancellation also be good but I can expect this process more performance according to this price range
5893,4.0,Only thing I do not like is that you cannot connect with two devices.
5894,5.0,Very good product but noise cancellation is not expected.
5895,5.0,"Bought these after using realme q2 ear buds for a year.
Did an extensive review before looking to buy a new pair.
1. It's not a great fit. Perhaps all ear buds suffer from this problem. I have to use small size silicon cover to fit. Yet it doesn't feel 100% re assuring. But manageable.
2. Sound quality is clean. Like most reviews said I felt the sound Signature is very neutral. It's good. Almost feel like a low cost audiophile ear buds
3. The app and eq is what does the custom trick. Keep tweaking the eq to hit your sweet spot. And the keep changing as per the gernre. It's. Task but the only way to listen to a variety of music .

4. The mids is general are very crisp. Bass as reviews by many as crisp. It is not. It's just a lean and near bass. Will have to change the eq for a good base profile.

5. These are great for the price point. I guess one can never compare it with a 10k+ ear buds."
5896,4.0,Oswm sound quality bass battery backup all is good 😊
5897,5.0,Good
5898,5.0,"After using them for 4 days, I am writing this review.
I switched from Realme buds Air 2 to this product. Although Realme buds Air 2 also did a almost perfect job but I wanted to try a different brand now.
JBL gives very nice sound quality.
The earpiece sits comfortably in the ear. They connect to the phone as soon as you take them out.
However, in my opinion the loudness of the sound was less in JBL as compared to Realme.
The bass effect is sufficient, I would say.
Realme gave more loud bass.
Still, I wouldn't say that I am not satisfied, these are also up to the mark.
I am using these with Motorola Edge 30 Fusion which has Dolby Atmos effect.
So overall result is excellent."
5899,5.0,"I bought it at 3600/-Rs, I'm using it for month now. I think u should go for it.
I'm getting trouble to register warranty. Overall good earphones but can't wear it while running or doing some kind of activities they slip easily from ears. I think Go for 230Ns they are better."
5900,5.0,"I'm using this product for two months. for me , I'm satisfied by the performance got from the product."
5901,3.0,Nice experience
5902,4.0,Iam using some powerful good brand gaming headphones so I don't feel that much sound quality difference in this the battery backup was really good for after lot of phone calls and using lot of media the ear buds charg standing more than 12 hrs peoples saying the left one was not paring but u can solve that by updating software in jbl app and resetting ear pod will short that problem out
5903,4.0,it is bulky earbuds but battery backup and sound quality is so good
5904,5.0,Little expensive as compared to other products.
5905,5.0,"The sound stage is good at this price point , compared to most others it's well balanced

Anc could be better , fit it good with the optional silicon plugs isolated the noise and doesn't fall off or even appear to"
5906,5.0,👍
5907,5.0,"Not fit for left ear but it fit for right ear don't getting the reason and I finally end up with arranging medium size tip to the left ear and large size for right.And whenever I powered off my earbuds with 40% charge at night,the next morning it downs to 20% and warns low battery notification. And ANC also not working properly during calls"
5908,4.0,"Its one of those ear buds from whom you expect a lot especially with the advertised features and JBL branding but are a tad disappointed.
Fit is fine.
Bass without the jbl tune app is dismal, ANC works best indoors and in the car or in the open is just a no show. Sound is balanced and clearly this is not for bass lovers.
I would not recommend it."
5909,4.0,"These are perfect for the price range with best signature sound offered by JLL.
However, the challenge I had was none of the earbuds provided fit my ears well, hence the sound proofing is not well at all, also, they keep slipping out and does not provide a snug fit for my ears. Solution: I changed the earbuds with a larger size than the ones provided by JBL and now the Fit is perfect, I can enjoy long hours of music with good ANC. But there is the problem, you can change the buds on the headphones, but they wont fit inside the charging case and fall off. So every time I had to charge these TWS, i had to remove the buds, replace themw ith that of JBL, put them in the case, once charged replace the buds again with the larger size that I use and this becomes tedious when you are planning to use them daily.
JBL should provide buds that fit larger ear canals as well. If you are the one like me who only uses large size buds, then pls think before you buy."
5910,5.0,Nice product
5911,5.0,"It's a good product but it can stop working quickly. And even if there's warrenty, it's very hard to claim. You have to travel to JBL service centre that provide warrenty claim. And there are very few such centres. If you live in big cities like Mumbai or Bangalore there's no issues. But other than that no so much simplicity. I would say buy sony products"
5912,5.0,I have been using this headphone/earpods for 5 days and as per my experience the sound quality is good and bass is topnotch at this price point....u can literally feels beat vibration in ur ears.... clean sound.....dont expect any thing from ANC features clearly saying its useless ....at first i though by looking online videos that the anc will be good n all but thats all lie...as per my experience it doesnt make any difference hearing with anc on and off.....overall ignoring anc this headphones are good
5913,5.0,Good
5914,5.0,"It was between the Sony wfc500. JBL tune230nc got my money. Review after 7 days.

1. App support is pretty good. Easy to use.
2. Sound quality is pretty good. Clear instruments and vocal. Bass isnt too overwhelming. Mess with EQ to get your preferred sound.
3. ANC is okay. Works amazing indoors. In busy traffic. It blocks out some amount of sound.
4. Battery is impressive.
5. Case and build quality in as good as it gets in this price range.
6. Call quality is decent. The talk aware and talk thru feature is pretty nice.

Really love these buds. But there is something missing to make it amazing. If your get a good deal go for it."
5915,4.0,"Great TWS for this price range.
The bass is great.
Connection issue is there when switching or pairing to another device.
Managing settings can be a hassel from the JBL app
Overall its recommended"
5916,4.0,"Long Battery life, better sound quality and noise cancellation.. quick charge… worth for the money"
5917,5.0,I love jbl but one small🤏 problem battery🔋 backup is very poor that's it every thing is super
5918,4.0,The fitting in ear was not comfortable while doing workout it will drop oftenly after setting up perfect ear tips to earbuds also ...And earbuds while placing in charging box earbuds don't disconnect ..we should lift and place it quite off
5919,5.0,Noise cancelation doesn't work on audio or video calls. Apart from that best to buy the product.
5920,4.0,I need update to increase volume
5921,3.0,"The ANC is very good, product design is too good. They fit perfectly, controllable app is awesome. Best for this price range."
5922,4.0,I only wish the tws also had a software support on windows. My main purpose for these are for office calls and I wish I could use the mute and NC changes with the touch feature while on office calls.
5923,4.0,"Hey there, bought this tws at 3999 during the Prime Sale.
Listing down the attributes.

Build: The build quality of the case is bad, m taking about the hinge here, it has a slight movement which can be annoying at times if you have OCD, otherwise the case has a good finish. The build quality of the buds is great. I drop one from 2 ft. on the floor and it did not have a single scratch on it of course depending on how it fell but its sturdy

Mic: Its quad mic, the quality is real good , cancels out most of the noise but if you are sitting under the fan it pics up literally all the wind , you can feel the wind gushing through the mic and its very evident to the receiver. They should have added a mesh on the mic which could have done the job. The mics are pretty open and on both sides of each bud so 0/5 in terms of wind cancellation. Otherwise the calls are crystal clear in a non windy environment. In public the cancellation is decent ,of course you cannot expect it to do wonders but its better than the normal wired/wireless earphones at 1k to 2k range with single mic.

Audio: The audio is fantastic , this is pretty subjective I am not a audio fan so I might not know how good is the audio in deep but it has good bass and the audio is sufficient at 80% volume too , its clear. JBL is into audio engineering since 70 years now they know how to do their job.

ANC: The ANC is just okay, it would block the humming environmental sound when no music is played but won't cancel people talking even 10 meters away at a decent decibel. When the music is played it cancels most of the sound you are definitely into the zone ,cannot hear much of anything once the music is playing of course it would depend on the music type but its decent for the price range.

Battery: Battery is great comparing into the other tws you get around 7 hours of playback so no issues here."
5924,4.0," Overall the device is a beautiful product. Both sound quality and noice cancellation provide a brilliant output. But i came accross a situation of not disconnecting when we place the buds in case. For me left buds is showing the problem, i want to place again and again inorder to blink the light."
5925,4.0,"Pros:-
1.)ANC is mind blowing it reduces most of the background noise and gives immersive music experience
2.)Ambient aware is one of the best feature when people are around you. You can hear what they are saying and listen to music at the same time
3.)I was looking for tws with dolby atmos support this one doesn't have but still far better than dolby atmos that because of the different eq options and custom eq is also given in app
4.) App is the real hero. You can switch ANC modes, earbuds control, Equalizer settings are available, find earbus and voice assistant.
CONS:-
1.) The major disappointment was the volume output of the buds. Very low volume output. I had to keep it at 85-90% for better music experience earlier i used to have oppo enco m32 which give same output just at 60% volume
2.) You must push the earphones so hard to get them inside your ear. The fit isn't good comfort is very poor better go with 230nc than 130nc for comfort.
3.) Battery backup is not as promised in my case but other reviews say it jas good battery backup
4.) In ear detection is missing at this price point every other tws at this price point has in ear detection.

OVERALL REVIEW:- Best tws with excellent ANC and music experience is next level, bass is so good and doesn't suppress vocals as other tws. Even without dolby atmos or aptx it sounds great because of the equalizer provided in the app"
5926,4.0,Good Product
5927,4.0,This JBL Tune 130NC TWS build quality gives me satisfaction that money i spend is worthy. Its comes with 2 additional size buds and a USB C charging cable. I find a bit difficulty to fit in my ears but its go easy with my friends ears. So it's fitting comfortable varied with different person. Sound quality is surprisingly amazing 😳. Stereo quality is good with decent bass. ANC quality is good enough but not still can be more better. Batteries last longer. Overall its worth for its price
5928,4.0,"Amazing product. Sound quality is great, build quality is great."
5929,4.0,"Truly a segment killer. Prior to buying this, given I was very sceptical about spending so much on earphones, I didn't know for sure if this was a good decision.

My options were either the the torq from crossbeats/ JBL 230anc and the Sony c500.

Having owned a crossbeats enigma already, I figured it was time to try something new. The JBL branding alone got my attention. Did my research and saw that most of the comparisons drawn for this model was with the 230 variant of the same series. The fact that this had a 10mm driver as opposed to the 6mm driver on the 230 already had me plus that was a pricier option. Again, the driver size doesn't always determine the sound quality or quantity but the JBL branding wasn't really seen on those out of the box. Some reviews state thats louder. Idk how. And the fit also seems better with the 230. This however has JBL branding proudly etheched on them.

Let's talk about the important bits.
> Fit.😶‍🌫️
Everyone's complaining about the comfort wearing them and how it's always coming off. This really just comes down to the rubber buds you use. Find something that's appropriate for your ears. The stock options didn't fit me but I have a bunch of buds from all my previous earphones so found one that fits me like a charm. Problem solved.

>Sound quality 🥵🥵
My dudes, hear me out when I say this. JBL brings it's own quality to music when it comes to their devices.
>Soundstage 🥵
The output for the 130anc is simply unmatched given the price segment. You can hear the sound so clearly seperated from various devices if you're an audiophile.
> Bass. 🤙🏽
Incredible. So booming. So unhindered. And all this without compromising on the vocals. The Equalizer option is such a blessing.
> Connectivity. ❤️
It searches for your phones Bluetooth the second it's out of the box. Never once did I have to open Bluetooth menu to connect.
> Volume.👍🏼 This is my only gripe. Hence the 4 stars. At full volume, you won't find yourself needing any more volume but you'd prefer if there was more in the tank 😉
So most of the time if you're gonna be using it at full volume to get the full feel of the JBL ANC 130. This too can easily be fixed by having external apps like a sound booster but for a normal person, it's absolutely unnecessary. I have higher volume requirements cuz I primarily use these buds at the gym.
> ANC.🙄 Okay another gripe but hey, at this price point that too from JBL, you're really not buying these for ANC. Like most others say here, the difference with ANC turned on and off is negligible.
> Battery. 🦍
I still don't know how these buds give over the head headphone level battery life.
Not only is the case super packed with a solid battery, the buds are optimized to deliver on a solid 8 hour battery despite playing music with such excellence at high volumes. Used the buds for an hour starting with 100% each and it was down to 90% after. 🥸
The JBL app precisely shows the battery left on each individual bud along with how much the case has left.
> Microphone.
The 4 mics on this really goes a long way. Despite other reviews that say it's not that good, I find it super impressive. It has a way of picking your voice even in loud environments. 5/5 for indoor calling. 4/5 for outdoor calling. And. For those wondering if ANC works during calls, it doesn't. You also have an option with the app that can determine how much of your own voice you hear when on call. 🙇 ( If outdoor calling is your priority, I'd recommend the 230 ANC cuz the design will better pick your voice)
Plus points
Talk through mode- double tap on the left bud and it'll enable talk through mode. Brings the music down so low so you don't have to take them off your ear should you need to talk to someone.
Design. So premium.
Case. Premium case. I'd recommend buying a seperate case protector too.

TDLR, unrivalled performance at this price point. I wouldn't be surprised if this can compete with buds priced @8-10k. Unmatched bass. Solid battery life. Poor ANC but who cares."
5930,4.0,"Let's talk about elephant in the room :
1) are they great, answer is : no.
2) are they good enough : maybe
3) but can they be made great doing some modifications : yes and no

Edited comment : (Given four stars earlier, reducing to 3 stars because I completed stopped using this as cons overshadowed the pros. It's unbearable now.)

Note : I am audiophile, so sound quality is important too me.
I have been using this earphone for month now , so lets list pros and cons.

Pros :
1) these are best for music listening ,hear me out only for music listening.
2) Battery is really really great (10/10) it's really really really really good.
3) build quality is good
4) app provided by JBL is really damn impressive
(This is where the 3rd point comes , where you can make them great by doing modification for voice).
5) it's overall good sounding earphones
6) microphone quality is good.

Let's talk about the
I am using for 1 month ,these cons will be good starting point for those who want to buy it.

Cons :
1) app sometimes don't work , I have to put by buds back in my case and then take it out , reconnect to keep app working. ( Sometimes annoys me)

2) fit in ear : I am never satisfied with the fit in the ear there is always in back of my mind that they are going to fall but they don't , but over time it actually really annoys I person to alway think that they are going to fall, bear in mind I am using for month ,it is not nice feeling to have that ear phone is always going to fall.

3) (only applicable when watching video)
lets talk about sound quality , I don't know this is me only or not but I have used various earphones, neckbands and headphones in past but never faced this issue in the past . The issue is the loundness in vocals is really loud some times , what I mean to say is if I am watching some movie and somebody shouts it just becomes too loud(for me) I have earphones called : sony MDR - XB55AP, never faced this specific issue with them.

4) vocal sync/lips sync problem : at start of video it takes 1,2 secs to lip sync with the video which is really annoying sometimes. It happening all the time, when I start the video, when I pause and play the video when new episode starts . This is a problem.(as video continues it becames fine, there is no more lip sync , it's only when video is started or paused and played again)

5) most of the problem with this earphone is with watching the videos : lip sync issue at start of video, sudden loudness when somebody shouts (this is so random that it becomes noticable)

Now you remember that I told you these issues can be solved and this earphone can be made great , yes we can do that by JBL headphone app.
You can fine tune your equaliser at solve loudness issue. You can switch the type to video type to make lip sync issue gone.

By app you can make this a great earphone but the problem is that they should not be dependent on app to be great. For example I have a Bluetooth tv so this earphone can connect to TV but because this app is not available for TVs it just do not perform that well . But if you are going to use mobile phones and tablets then you can make them great.

At this price point they are good like 7/10 ,but not great like 10/10. Seen quite a few better sounding earphones in thile past not like these are bad but they are 7/10 ,lets be most generous : 7.5/10"
5931,4.0,"Pros -
* The audio quality is super. No complaints.
Rich Bass. You can even set what you want on the JBL app if you want more vocals or more bass. Even if you want to customise it, you can customise it.
*The battery life is great. It's been over a month and I charged it like only 2-3 times. You can easily expect 20-30 of hours of usage without ANC on
* The JBL app provides you many features also there is fast pair which enables you to connect without even turning on bluetooth
*Find my earbuds is another feature
Cons - These cons are actually my expectations but these are not there in any headphones in this price
*The ANC is just worthy for the price and not something which is there on 10k-20k earphones. There is a difference when you turn on and turn off the ANC but its very little. And I turn it off always because I feel it's a waste of battery
* No multiple connections - You need to disconnect one device to connect it to other
*Find my earbuds works only when bluetooth is connected"
5932,4.0,"This the best bass and noise cancellation Earbuds you can get at this price range (I bought this when this was around 5K).

Sound quality is great and is surprisingly at a level almost to my 9K rupees JBL LIVE650BTNC headphones, GREAT.

I'm not a heavy user of Earbuds, so for me it's lasting more than a week on a single charge. So if you are a normal user who won't use these for a whole day, u can go a whole week without charging it.

Touch controls are very good but you will get a little annoyed if mistouch happens a lot.

One thing I didn't like is the transition sound it makes when I turn on/off noise cancellation. It makes a loud sound before switching from ambient aware or talkthru and I tried lowering it's volume by decreasing the volume of the music, but it didn't work. It's a very loud sound when compared to an average music volume most of the people listen to.

NOTE- ""THIS IS NOT A WATER PROOF EARBUDS"""
5933,4.0,"This is my first ANC feature product. I find this feature very useful especially during travelling. Battery backup is huge and can manage moderate usage 6hrs/day for 4 days easily, much helpful for long train jrnys. JBL is providing amazing features at very decent price. Case quality is just okay, I was expecting it little better. I was using Sony MDR XB50BS earlier, which has amazing Bass & very high volume levels where you can hear even the feable background instruments clearly. It didn't had ANC & was wired backhead. Compared to that, jbl could improve sound quality going forward"
5934,4.0,"Fit - excellent
Sound - Blows ur mind
App - Easy and usefull
Overall performance - Fantastic
I purchased 130NC during Amazon GIF and got a fab deal at 3599.
I've used other great TWS brands but this one is a clear winner 🏆 considering overall performance.
Just one small complaint - The call quality could be better. The person on the other end can hear you clearly even in very noisy environment as the focus is your voice but background noise is very evident.
Overall
Go for it ... You won't regret the buy and you'll love the experience."
5935,4.0,"I bought these earphones in amazone sale. The delivery and packing was good. Moving to product , following are pros and cons of it
Pros:
1. Sound quality: It has good sound quality with a dedicated app to adjust the earphones for different audio quality configuration
2.Quick connect and range: It quickly connects with your device and does provide long range for Bluetooth connectivity
3: Light weight: Its quite light in weight which enables you to wear it for long time

Cons:
1: poor fit: Though the product is meant to fit snuggly in the ear, it does not provide great fit. You will always feel that they will pop out any time.
2. ANC: Despite have ANC feature,it does not provide high quality noise cancellation even for rhythmic noise like sound of rain or ceiling fan which it is supposed to suppress
3.Call quality: JBL claims to provide superior call quality but it does provide it only in quiet places. In crowded place with surrounding noise,it somehow transfers surrounding noise more than the callers voice. I have to unplug my earphones during calls as people at the other end complaint about surrounding noise. It should at least be able to provide call quality which you get with normal phone call using phones microphones"
5936,4.0,"The tws have really good audio quality for the price, the high, mids and lows are very clear, and you can adjust them using the JBL Headphones app.
The ANC is okay considering the price, so don't expect it to cancel all frequencies, it just cancels fan or air conditioner's level ambient sound. The ambient mode is quite helpful and work fine.
However, I expected the case to be built more sturdier as it lacks tightness at the hinges. The battery life is about 36 hours without ANC at 40% volume.
My least favorite thing about these is the range which is fine only up to a few meters with no obstruction, so the moment you step out of you room, it disconnects which was not expected considering BT 5.3 and it also becomes annoying sometimes. Also, they comfortable but they fall out pretty easily so keep these 2 in mind while buying.
Bought it for 3800/- so don't have many complains !"
5937,4.0," Bought these yesterday (Sale) for around 3400/- after all the bank offers.
Seriously thought of buying JBl for so long but they were always at the range of 5000(the good ones with touch controls)
So this deal looked very tempting and I went for it
First impressions:
The case looked okay-ish in the photos but trust me it feels so classic hands on.It looks class &Matty (mine is black). Coming to the buds I've heard so much about the misfits in the ear..I'm still trying to figure out how to wear them comfortably but if you are someone sitting at your desk/lying on your bed, watching a movie or something,they won't bother you at all. I bought these for that so i felt comfortable.The range is so good. I used Noise tws earlier but these Have almost double the range of Noise.
The app: Cool features...the only thing I felt a bit not cool is that the touch controls are preset..i.e you'll have to choose between 3 preset features 1.Volume 2.music change 3.Anc you can opt one for each bud but the other will be left out. So I left out Anc and assigned volume to my Right bud and music control to my left bud. They should have allowed to include all three.
Apart from that you can control ANC from the app..the ambient aware and talk through modes are amazing and new to be honest.
Hey i got these for 3400 I'm not gonna complain at all! Totally satisfied..and the SOUND: WELL ITS JBL so the BASS is booming and the Equalizer in the app lets you change the moods to vocals/jazz/club or you can even create your own Equalizer modes. So ITSALL GOODMAN. IF YOU ARE GETTING THESE FOR LESS THAN 4K YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY GO FORWARD. Coz afterall it's JBL!"

I switched from Realme buds Air 2 to this product. Although Realme buds Air 2 also did a almost perfect job but I wanted to try a different brand now.
JBL gives very nice sound quality.
The earpiece sits comfortably in the ear. They connect to the phone as soon as you take them out.
However, in my opinion the loudness of the sound was less in JBL as compared to Realme.
The bass effect is sufficient, I would say.
Realme gave more loud bass.
Still, I wouldn't say that I am not satisfied, these are also up to the mark.
I am using these with Motorola Edge 30 Fusion which has Dolby Atmos effect.
So overall result is excellent."

5951,3.0,Iam using some powerful good brand gaming headphones so I don't feel that much sound quality difference in this the battery backup was really good for after lot of phone calls and using lot of media the ear buds charg standing more than 12 hrs peoples saying the left one was not paring but u can solve that by updating software in jbl app and resetting ear pod will short that problem out
5952,4.0,it is bulky earbuds but battery backup and sound quality is so good
5953,4.0,Little expensive as compared to other products.
5954,4.0,"The sound stage is good at this price point , compared to most others it's well balanced

Anc could be better , fit it good with the optional silicon plugs isolated the noise and doesn't fall off or even appear to"
5955,4.0,👍
5956,4.0,"Not fit for left ear but it fit for right ear don't getting the reason and I finally end up with arranging medium size tip to the left ear and large size for right.And whenever I powered off my earbuds with 40% charge at night,the next morning it downs to 20% and warns low battery notification. And ANC also not working properly during calls"
5957,4.0,"Its one of those ear buds from whom you expect a lot especially with the advertised features and JBL branding but are a tad disappointed.
Fit is fine.
Bass without the jbl tune app is dismal, ANC works best indoors and in the car or in the open is just a no show. Sound is balanced and clearly this is not for bass lovers.
I would not recommend it."
5958,4.0,"These are perfect for the price range with best signature sound offered by JLL.
However, the challenge I had was none of the earbuds provided fit my ears well, hence the sound proofing is not well at all, also, they keep slipping out and does not provide a snug fit for my ears. Solution: I changed the earbuds with a larger size than the ones provided by JBL and now the Fit is perfect, I can enjoy long hours of music with good ANC. But there is the problem, you can change the buds on the headphones, but they wont fit inside the charging case and fall off. So every time I had to charge these TWS, i had to remove the buds, replace themw ith that of JBL, put them in the case, once charged replace the buds again with the larger size that I use and this becomes tedious when you are planning to use them daily.
JBL should provide buds that fit larger ear canals as well. If you are the one like me who only uses large size buds, then pls think before you buy."
5959,4.0,Nice product
5960,4.0,"It's a good product but it can stop working quickly. And even if there's warrenty, it's very hard to claim. You have to travel to JBL service centre that provide warrenty claim. And there are very few such centres. If you live in big cities like Mumbai or Bangalore there's no issues. But other than that no so much simplicity. I would say buy sony products"
5961,4.0,I have been using this headphone/earpods for 5 days and as per my experience the sound quality is good and bass is topnotch at this price point....u can literally feels beat vibration in ur ears.... clean sound.....dont expect any thing from ANC features clearly saying its useless ....at first i though by looking online videos that the anc will be good n all but thats all lie...as per my experience it doesnt make any difference hearing with anc on and off.....overall ignoring anc this headphones are good
5962,4.0,Good
5963,4.0,"It was between the Sony wfc500. JBL tune230nc got my money. Review after 7 days.

1. App support is pretty good. Easy to use.
2. Sound quality is pretty good. Clear instruments and vocal. Bass isnt too overwhelming. Mess with EQ to get your preferred sound.
3. ANC is okay. Works amazing indoors. In busy traffic. It blocks out some amount of sound.
4. Battery is impressive.
5. Case and build quality in as good as it gets in this price range.
6. Call quality is decent. The talk aware and talk thru feature is pretty nice.

Really love these buds. But there is something missing to make it amazing. If your get a good deal go for it."
5964,3.0,"Great TWS for this price range.
The bass is great.
Connection issue is there when switching or pairing to another device.
Managing settings can be a hassel from the JBL app
Overall its recommended"
5965,4.0,"Long Battery life, better sound quality and noise cancellation.. quick charge… worth for the money"
5966,4.0,I love jbl but one small🤏 problem battery🔋 backup is very poor that's it every thing is super
5967,4.0,The fitting in ear was not comfortable while doing workout it will drop oftenly after setting up perfect ear tips to earbuds also ...And earbuds while placing in charging box earbuds don't disconnect ..we should lift and place it quite off
5968,4.0,Noise cancelation doesn't work on audio or video calls. Apart from that best to buy the product.
5969,4.0,I need update to increase volume
5970,4.0,"The ANC is very good, product design is too good. They fit perfectly, controllable app is awesome. Best for this price range."
5971,3.0,I only wish the tws also had a software support on windows. My main purpose for these are for office calls and I wish I could use the mute and NC changes with the touch feature while on office calls.
5972,4.0,"Hey there, bought this tws at 3999 during the Prime Sale.
Listing down the attributes.

Build: The build quality of the case is bad, m taking about the hinge here, it has a slight movement which can be annoying at times if you have OCD, otherwise the case has a good finish. The build quality of the buds is great. I drop one from 2 ft. on the floor and it did not have a single scratch on it of course depending on how it fell but its sturdy

Mic: Its quad mic, the quality is real good , cancels out most of the noise but if you are sitting under the fan it pics up literally all the wind , you can feel the wind gushing through the mic and its very evident to the receiver. They should have added a mesh on the mic which could have done the job. The mics are pretty open and on both sides of each bud so 0/5 in terms of wind cancellation. Otherwise the calls are crystal clear in a non windy environment. In public the cancellation is decent ,of course you cannot expect it to do wonders but its better than the normal wired/wireless earphones at 1k to 2k range with single mic.

Audio: The audio is fantastic , this is pretty subjective I am not a audio fan so I might not know how good is the audio in deep but it has good bass and the audio is sufficient at 80% volume too , its clear. JBL is into audio engineering since 70 years now they know how to do their job.

ANC: The ANC is just okay, it would block the humming environmental sound when no music is played but won't cancel people talking even 10 meters away at a decent decibel. When the music is played it cancels most of the sound you are definitely into the zone ,cannot hear much of anything once the music is playing of course it would depend on the music type but its decent for the price range.

Battery: Battery is great comparing into the other tws you get around 7 hours of playback so no issues here."
5973,4.0," Overall the device is a beautiful product. Both sound quality and noice cancellation provide a brilliant output. But i came accross a situation of not disconnecting when we place the buds in case. For me left buds is showing the problem, i want to place again and again inorder to blink the light."
5974,4.0,"Pros:-
1.)ANC is mind blowing it reduces most of the background noise and gives immersive music experience
2.)Ambient aware is one of the best feature when people are around you. You can hear what they are saying and listen to music at the same time
3.)I was looking for tws with dolby atmos support this one doesn't have but still far better than dolby atmos that because of the different eq options and custom eq is also given in app
4.) App is the real hero. You can switch ANC modes, earbuds control, Equalizer settings are available, find earbus and voice assistant.
CONS:-
1.) The major disappointment was the volume output of the buds. Very low volume output. I had to keep it at 85-90% for better music experience earlier i used to have oppo enco m32 which give same output just at 60% volume
2.) You must push the earphones so hard to get them inside your ear. The fit isn't good comfort is very poor better go with 230nc than 130nc for comfort.
3.) Battery backup is not as promised in my case but other reviews say it jas good battery backup
4.) In ear detection is missing at this price point every other tws at this price point has in ear detection.

OVERALL REVIEW:- Best tws with excellent ANC and music experience is next level, bass is so good and doesn't suppress vocals as other tws. Even without dolby atmos or aptx it sounds great because of the equalizer provided in the app"
5975,4.0,Good Product
5976,4.0,This JBL Tune 130NC TWS build quality gives me satisfaction that money i spend is worthy. Its comes with 2 additional size buds and a USB C charging cable. I find a bit difficulty to fit in my ears but its go easy with my friends ears. So it's fitting comfortable varied with different person. Sound quality is surprisingly amazing 😳. Stereo quality is good with decent bass. ANC quality is good enough but not still can be more better. Batteries last longer. Overall its worth for its price
5977,4.0,"Amazing product. Sound quality is great, build quality is great."
5978,4.0,"Best entry level NC headset with better sound quality. NC is not that good but cancels subtle noises and turn down down other noises. People talking are not canceled, only muted down. Sound is good for the price range(4/5). If you are looking for superior NC, try to buy sony xm4s wheb there is an offer which is my next headset to buy. The cushions are far too small to fully cover ear, they kinda rests on ur ear edges which is kinda painful over long usage. There was no sweating issue since the headphone has air holes and provide air circulation to ears. Charging time was around 1 hour. Battery life is so perfect, like u can charge this full and use it for a while week without NC with around 5to6 hrs of daily usage. So final verdict is bang for the bucks. If u r into NC, just go buy xm4s... 🏃"
5979,4.0,"Sound is not the loudest and not the best bass I have experienced but still is very satisfactory and the mic is also good for video calls. Noise cancellation is ok and stops the sounds like ceiling fan and minimal background noise. But the difference with and without it is not great. Battery is also good, I charge it after 3 days or so... I use it in office and during leisure time in evenings or night. Sound leakage is also very less that too on high volume."
5980,4.0,"If you are throwing just in the name of JBL then please atleast don't go for this. Increr your budget and buy premium one. Because the type of experience this particular headt is just an average. I think 2-3k priced headphones can also give this kind of experience. The sound quality is good. But there is some kind of weirdnes i notice. When you listen to music without ANC then there will no bass at all. When you hear it a ANC you will find some base. But when you maximize the volume then bass will go away. And in my case at full or 90% sound level with my equilizer onn, the sounds tears apart like some cheap roadside headphones. Battery life is so far is v good. With aux cable also same kind experience you get. This headphones is not loud. Because it can't handle loud sound. The sound become dull and start tearing. Overall this could good headphone if would have paid 2-2.5k not 5.6k.
#Iam returning this item."
5981,4.0,"Initially sound quality is less. After using it for 20 days now the sound quality is so good.
Noise cancellation & battery backup is working fine.
But it will be difficult to use it continuously for 1hour where you feel some pain."
5982,4.0,"Sound, Build quality, comfort, connectivity, backup, everything is good. But the most important thing which is the Noise Cancellation feature, is useless!
So you're in need of NC headphones don't buy these, but if that's not important to you, then these are fine. Although you can get good headphones (without NC) for far less than the price of these headphones."
5983,4.0," Anc is not much... Ofcourse the Sound quality is top notch... Volume cant be increased pretty much... U will be forced to listen high energy songs in medium volume... Sometimes when anc is on, the bass sound begins to falter and make ""brrr brrr"" noise... But i can live with it as i seldom use anc..."
5984,4.0,"These headphones are a little disorienting, and I can explain. I was a bit skeptical on what the ANC would be like on budget headphones. And I was right.

The first thing I noticed when I tried these on was the kind of seal around the ears. It creates this vacuum-like effect where it feels like all the air in and around your ears have been sucked out, which could be good for the noise cancelling, but definitely feels strange. And then there is the active noise cancelling itself, which when you turn on, it kind of shuts out the world around you, but only a little bit. It doesn't cancel white noise, it just makes it quieter. I was still able to hear the fan in my room, and my fan is not noisy in the first place. The ANC was a disappointment and made me feel uncomfortable after a while.

The sound quality on the other hand, is good. I have used some JBL headphones like the JBL Quantum 600, and these have a sound that is similar to those headphones. It's a typical JBL sound, where there is slightly more emphasis to the bass and treble, but the mids are not completely crushed. So it sounds like the entire range has been amplified. It's a good sound for people who like the presence of good bass, but don't want too much bass.

Battery life has been good so far. Do note that these don't come with a carrying case, but the headphones can be folded. They charge via USB-C, they have an audio jack and come with a cable.

Overall, these sound good. I just wish the ANC was better."
5985,4.0,"I have been using the headphones (TUNE 760) for more than a month, here is my review

At first (2 days of purchasing) I was very disappointed because I felt that the sound quality was very lacking, the base and loudness disappointed me, but after a week, it started to sound very very good, I think it needed a burn period, because this headphone is now sounding very very good for me.

Build Quality - the build quality is good, no major issues, the pad is soft.

Comfort - the headphone is comfortable, but one issue is that the clamping force is a bit tight, maybe because I have a big head. Another thing is, even though this is an over read headphone it is not that big, so some part of my ear gets a bit uncomfortable after long use, but if u adjust and find the correct comfortable position, you cab wear it for a long time, I watched a 3 hr movie without any issues

Battery - omg, one of the best part of this headphone, claims 50 hr without noise cancellation, I think it lives upto the mark. You don't have to worry about battery

Sound quality - I'm not an audiophile, let me clear it up. The sound quality I felt was really good and I was very impressed, after the burn in period, so if you are buying this give it at least 1 week before judging it, trust me it really really gets better. The base was not that high, but not lacking also, was upto the mark.

Noise cancellation - it wasn't really that great, could slightly reduce the fan noise that's it, I wouldn't say it is useless, but not that bad either, could reduce the noise of tv from next room when I listened to music, so it did came in handy also with noise cancellation the sound quality I felt improved a bit.

Conclusion - as I said, I was really disappointed at first with the purchase, thought I wasted the money(6.5k) but now I'm really really enjoyed it, watching movies was the best experience with dolby music profile in my phone. I'd say it is really worth the money if ur looking for a headphone around 7k"
5986,4.0,"Review after using 2+ months. Earcups are not suitable for long time use. That pains to ears a lot.. Barring this no other complaint. Happy with the sound, NC, connectivity etc."
5987,4.0,"It’s uncomfortable; you can’t wear it for more than 1 hr in one go.
Sound quality is average.
No app support to control device.
No case is provided.
Looks average.
You can get better headphones in this range."
5988,4.0,"Using this product for 2 weeks. It's a 4.5 star product but not 5 star due to following reasons. I listen to music a lot, watch movies and also plays a lot of games. My experience is given below.

Cons.

1. Ear comfort ( 4.5 stars )- Although the product is extremely comfortable I have large ears so a little pain is there if I use it for prolonged periods (2 hour +). People with small to medium ear size may not have any problem with this. I will have to remove for a few minutes and then I can continue. The ear cushions are really soft and the comfort is so far the best.
2. Adding to the above point - if you are living in a relatively hot area, ears might sweat and may become uncomfortable. My place is 30+ degree Celsius always. In cooler climate the issue is not existing.
3. Audio quality is excellent but really minimal buzzing is there for deep bass. This will not be noticeable at all if you are playing music or gaming. For music and audio editing this may be an issue. Not sure if this is only there for my product. I am satisfied with the product so not returning it.
4. No next or prev buttons.

Pros.
1. Extremely long battery life and quick charging. I have been using the product for 4 days without recharging and is a huge plus. Not tested how many hours I get with ANC on but is pretty long. I use the headsets for 5-6 hours daily and is really good. Charging is pretty quick too.
2. ANC is really good. While I was traveling it was able to filter most of the traffic noice except really loud noises. People chatting and other noice is not at all audible so Mom might get angry ;)
3. Latency is really low. I was able to play pubg mobile with this and latency was almost undetected but it is there.
4. Audio quality is superb, bass is pretty good and is the best so far
5. Premium build quality. Weight is little high than the cheap plastic and fibre headsets. This one has metal frame.
6. Good range.
7. Nice fit. Not too tight not too loose."
5989,4.0,Happy to use
5990,4.0,I have not received C-USB Charging cable along with this kit pack. I could not connect it in my mobile but I could connect it in my computer successfully.
5991,4.0,इस हेडफोन को लेने का मेरा मुख्य आशय noise cancellation था। इस संदर्भ में इसका कार्य औसत कोटि का है । इसके अतिरिक्त ब्ल्यूटूथ अथवा ध्वनि गुणवत्ता के संदर्भ में ये उच्च कोटि का है । वस्तुतः इस दायरे में noise cancellation मिलना कठिन है ।
5992,4.0,
5993,4.0,sound is not what exactly I was assuming.... as per price sound quality should be more Cristal with high beats also
5994,4.0,"1 year review

Pros:
Battery backup is good, last atleast 1 week with ANC off.
Sound quality is good
Good gaming experience, very less lag
Used with laptops, mobile phones, ipad, no issues till now.

Cons
Not suitable for workouts, it will fall off.
ANC is not good."
5995,4.0,Not worth for spending so much money if you are buying for NC and deep bass music.
5996,4.0,"This is a first impression review, i could give it a better or weaker review later.

as soon as I got my hands on the device, I was impressed by the finish, it looks like it could last a while before wear starts to show, the driver cups are really free and allow for various positions, though they are a bit stiff, compared to the ones I was using.

Now for the sound.
oddly its got 2 sound modes.......let me elaborate

When you turn on the headphones for the first time, ANC will be on by default (canceled the sound of the ac and the fans completely )

in this mode, the bass is quite good but not overwhelming (if you are a bass head, look for something else, trust me)

but if you turn the ANC off, the bass take as nose dive and lands with a bellyflop. It seems to take a step back, and everything is more ""open""

and on the note of ANC, if you pass 80% volume with ANC on and playing music, the ANC will automatically disable itself and the light will stay on. you will have to turn off the headphones and turn them back on to get the ANC back ......weird

THIS IS BY NO MEANS BAD THOUGH ......if .....you are not a complete bass head and dont only seek bass (if you want bass more than everything else ......get skull candy crushers)

the mids and treble are maintained even if the ANC is off or on

Pairing is way too easy, its on my PC and phone, but the dual pairing has its fair bit of delay between switching the output (I haven't found the hang of it yet)"
5997,3.0,"Sound is ok , but bass is not as expected. The price is overrated as per its performance. with full volume the bass start cracking also."
5998,3.0,Sound via aux is not good.
5999,3.0,Bass could be better...rest all good
6000,4.0,"The sound of headphone is good i like it Bluetooth connectivity is great, only thing it lack is base. Build quality is oke , plastic body
Overall good product"
6001,3.0,"It works and thats all, decent sound but no tweak-able sound because no app support. Burn-in of driver is a must. Never faced any random disconnect so bluetooth works fine. They are comfortable for like about 1-2hrs for my head as of now maybe a little more use will loosen them."
6002,4.0,"I was in the market for a good cheap NC headphones. Obviously the dream was Sony XM4, but those were a little out of budget. So I went on the market, searching for HOURS, company after company, model after model, and I ended up here. And I must say I wasn’t disappointed. Now I’ve tried other NC headphones before, but the top of the line ones like Bose Quite or Apple AirPod max and these aren’t comparable to them at all ofc. I mean to be fair they are literally 1/5th the price. But they aren’t bad.

Talking about the noise cancellation, it’s nice but definitely doesn’t cancel all the sounds. The low pitched background noises that you hear in Indian senators, does a good job at masking that, I will give you that much, put high pitched non repetitive sounds like birds chirping or people talking, that you can definitely figure out. This I’m talking with the ANC on and the music off but as soon as the music turns on, Everything disappears, so that’s great. I was just a tad dissapointed cause I bought this so I can use it in trains and planes with loud noise and it does substantially decrease the sound but doesn’t cancel it fully

But THE BEST part about these headphones? The battery. Just spectacular. I have been using these for the last 10 days and lemme tell you, they came with 75% battery and I haven’t used them since. Just amazing. Now let’s see how long do they hold up and their durability only time will tell, which I will update for sure, but till them, I would definitely definitely recommend them."
6003,4.0,I had been using Bose QC 35 Ii from last 3 year and few days back It’s started connecting issues with my iPhone then I visited to the SC and Bose SC DM suggested me to replace the gadget with paying of 80% of the present QC 35ii cost and I thought it’s not worth to pay 25000 than I have gone through the review of this model it’s very good comparing to the price of BOse and i am using comfortably in weekend or travelling.
6004,4.0,The product quality is good but it is very uncomfortable to use due to stiffness and its weight.
6005,4.0,"ANC - Very Poor
Sound quality- not that much great, getting high sound in music over audio, calls are not good"
6006,4.0,Product is not working so kindly advise how to contact supplier as well as if it’s guarantee then at where to send for repairs
6007,4.0,There is bit dip in the device for charging. The device is not getting fully charged instead the led indicators are turning off while charging (indicates fully charged) but when I connect with my phone the battery indicator shows that the device needs to be sufficiently charged.
6008,4.0,"The sound quality is good, you can feel a surrounding effect, and the bass is OK (not too much), but the NC (noise cancellation) is not too good - 80-90% noise canceled.
Overall it is PERFECT."
6009,4.0,The bass is not that much on these headphones. It's a bit tight in the ear but the built quality is very good.
6010,4.0,"After Sennheiser, this is my second noise-canceling headphone. The headphone does a great job listening to music and is JBL Tune 756NC-certified. However, it is too small for large heads like mine. I recommend that you try Sennheiser headphones before you decide to buy this one."
6011,4.0,"Connectivity is good and faster. ANC works good. For this rate this is the maximum ANC you can get but still soo good enough. Battery is far better. Continuously you can use it for 24hrs. The only CON is, the bass is a bit low. But That's ok. This is enough I often hear songs with high bass so it's low for me. If the bass was enough I would have given 5/5.

Also FYI, The maximum device we can connect at a time is 2. If u want to connect another, u need to disconnect on any one."
6012,4.0,"Review after a month use :)

JBL 760ANC BT headphone

Initially though i was disappointed with sound, dont know why, but now i feel the audio is good. The frequency range is high i think as each instruments are highlighted instead of thrown at once. I like that. Mild bass . I like this bass better than jbl infinity where it vibrates and hurt ears at high volume.

Noise cancellation
I dont know why they implemented ANC here as nothing as get past the ear cup. Your ears fit perfectly well into their cup. So comfortable.and then you have to give some time to adapt.

Media
Watching movies is a delight in this jbl 760anc BT headphone. Be it Guitar pieces , glass breaks ,vocals, edm everything is beautifully presented to you giving life to the movie.
MUSIC is nothing short of wonder. I have vibed with kabira,subhanalla, infected mushroom heavy weight (9 mins of soul dance).

Battery
It is a beast in this section.i cant remember the last time i put charge to this monster.i really hate headphones stuttering batterylow batterylow amidst a movie. They have battery for saying that nonsense but not play the movie.lol. but i know iam in safe hands now.

Charge
Its a type c port .tat is awesome

Verdict
Get the headphone with a right kidney.wont regret it !"
6013,4.0,Noise Cancellation is not very effective
6014,3.0," This is my first over ear headphones, and I’m writing review after a few days of usage. Sound quality good, noise cancellation (even a beginner can feel) could have done better, but maybe good for this cost. I bought this specifically for calls, because airpods perform worse, with previous the other side is not able to hear my voice properly - This headphone is not giving me such issues. I even used this for my office calls, no one complained for any background noise. It is perfect of you want to have long calls. Although, you may get a tad tired after putting it on for a few hours, I like to take a break. Battery is good so far, I keep ANC turned off unless I’m out. As you can see in video, it can be packed neatly too. No complaints so far"
6015,4.0,"I was searching for some noise cancelling headphones that didn’t give me a headache, and I found them. They connect easily to my phone and computer. I didn’t realize until later that they’re supposed to come with an audio cable, but mine didn’t. It’s also not the typical 3.5mm port, so I’m struggling to find the right cable so I can use them on planes and whenever else I want it wired. If they actually came with the cable I’d likely be a lot happier with the purchase."
6016,4.0,Even sony xb55ap in ear earphones are much better sounding and stronger bass than this headphones
6017,4.0,"If you an Apple device then I don’t recommend this product.
It works very good with android but sound quality is very poor when using with an Apple device."
6018,4.0,"The noise cancellation is not good as it only cancels out small things like fan sound, the noise cancellation gets turned off automatically when you increase the volume above 80% which you have to do quite often as the speakers are not very loud. Also I would have liked a bit more bass. The battery life is amazing, I can survive about 3 to 4 days without charging them in one go."
6019,4.0,Sound volume 100 too low
6020,4.0,"50 hours battery
Earphones Jak
Aur kuch nhi hai."
6021,4.0,"Sound? CRISP and beautiful. Cinema-quality if you're watching TV etc. No lag. I got these as a gift for my mum on her birthday and unfortunately I had to return these because they gave her a bad headache. The problem is the fit (sits heavy on the head) and the earcups didn't cover her ear all the way. So UNLESS you have small ears, you may also experience the same issues. Battery is GREAT! ANC is good but nothing exceptional. You do need to spend a bit more to get superb ANC but at 6500 it's fairly decent! Sad to have to return these. There is a bit of sound leakage at high volumes, but you have to be very close to the person to hear it."
6022,3.0,"Headset cup sponge later peeling off, quality. Apart from that headset quality and bass good."
6023,4.0,I like noise canceling because canceled sounds like drilling and boring construction building houses happening in my neighborhood Bluetooth connect to Android devices is quick but with iPhone not quick and sometimes manually do to connect sound quality is great
6024,3.0,"Noise cancellation is below par...rest all options are just ok. Also head phones are on the heavier side and takes time to adjust. Would suggest to look for other options. Cannot mute calls, Zoom, teams meeting calls from headphones"
6025,4.0,GOOD PRODUCT
6026,3.0,"JBL is known for its sound engineering and build quality in budget and higher-end audio products.
No less in this too, this is a very nice headset to use if you like to have proper audio experiences, my reason to pick this was for video editing and it has done a good job in that.
Regarding the Noise canceling part you just get 1 level On and Off, with no app support this is a bit disappointing, and please note this is not an ANC - Active Noise Canceling so do not expect much from this headset towards Noise-canceling
My other disappointment was with AMAZON as when I purchased this had an offer of a Time Prime Subscription and Zomota coupon, I did not receive any of it and when I reached out to them now they are asking for proof of the offer mentioned."
6027,4.0,"Excellent product, but noise cancellation
not that much effective."
6028,3.0,Headphones are good but i think i can't use these headphones continue for 30 or 40 mins.
6029,3.0,"Best entry level NC headset with better sound quality. NC is not that good but cancels subtle noises and turn down down other noises. People talking are not canceled, only muted down. Sound is good for the price range(4/5). If you are looking for superior NC, try to buy sony xm4s wheb there is an offer which is my next headset to buy. The cushions are far too small to fully cover ear, they kinda rests on ur ear edges which is kinda painful over long usage. There was no sweating issue since the headphone has air holes and provide air circulation to ears. Charging time was around 1 hour. Battery life is so perfect, like u can charge this full and use it for a while week without NC with around 5to6 hrs of daily usage. So final verdict is bang for the bucks. If u r into NC, just go buy xm4s... 🏃"
6030,4.0,"Sound is not the loudest and not the best bass I have experienced but still is very satisfactory and the mic is also good for video calls. Noise cancellation is ok and stops the sounds like ceiling fan and minimal background noise. But the difference with and without it is not great. Battery is also good, I charge it after 3 days or so... I use it in office and during leisure time in evenings or night. Sound leakage is also very less that too on high volume."
6031,4.0,"If you are throwing just in the name of JBL then please atleast don't go for this. Increr your budget and buy premium one. Because the type of experience this particular headt is just an average. I think 2-3k priced headphones can also give this kind of experience. The sound quality is good. But there is some kind of weirdnes i notice. When you listen to music without ANC then there will no bass at all. When you hear it a ANC you will find some base. But when you maximize the volume then bass will go away. And in my case at full or 90% sound level with my equilizer onn, the sounds tears apart like some cheap roadside headphones. Battery life is so far is v good. With aux cable also same kind experience you get. This headphones is not loud. Because it can't handle loud sound. The sound become dull and start tearing. Overall this could good headphone if would have paid 2-2.5k not 5.6k.
#Iam returning this item."
6032,3.0,"Initially sound quality is less. After using it for 20 days now the sound quality is so good.
Noise cancellation & battery backup is working fine.
But it will be difficult to use it continuously for 1hour where you feel some pain."
6033,3.0,"Sound, Build quality, comfort, connectivity, backup, everything is good. But the most important thing which is the Noise Cancellation feature, is useless!
So you're in need of NC headphones don't buy these, but if that's not important to you, then these are fine. Although you can get good headphones (without NC) for far less than the price of these headphones."
6034,4.0," Anc is not much... Ofcourse the Sound quality is top notch... Volume cant be increased pretty much... U will be forced to listen high energy songs in medium volume... Sometimes when anc is on, the bass sound begins to falter and make ""brrr brrr"" noise... But i can live with it as i seldom use anc..."
6035,4.0,"These headphones are a little disorienting, and I can explain. I was a bit skeptical on what the ANC would be like on budget headphones. And I was right.

The first thing I noticed when I tried these on was the kind of seal around the ears. It creates this vacuum-like effect where it feels like all the air in and around your ears have been sucked out, which could be good for the noise cancelling, but definitely feels strange. And then there is the active noise cancelling itself, which when you turn on, it kind of shuts out the world around you, but only a little bit. It doesn't cancel white noise, it just makes it quieter. I was still able to hear the fan in my room, and my fan is not noisy in the first place. The ANC was a disappointment and made me feel uncomfortable after a while.

The sound quality on the other hand, is good. I have used some JBL headphones like the JBL Quantum 600, and these have a sound that is similar to those headphones. It's a typical JBL sound, where there is slightly more emphasis to the bass and treble, but the mids are not completely crushed. So it sounds like the entire range has been amplified. It's a good sound for people who like the presence of good bass, but don't want too much bass.

Battery life has been good so far. Do note that these don't come with a carrying case, but the headphones can be folded. They charge via USB-C, they have an audio jack and come with a cable.

Overall, these sound good. I just wish the ANC was better."
6036,3.0,"I have been using the headphones (TUNE 760) for more than a month, here is my review

At first (2 days of purchasing) I was very disappointed because I felt that the sound quality was very lacking, the base and loudness disappointed me, but after a week, it started to sound very very good, I think it needed a burn period, because this headphone is now sounding very very good for me.

Build Quality - the build quality is good, no major issues, the pad is soft.

Comfort - the headphone is comfortable, but one issue is that the clamping force is a bit tight, maybe because I have a big head. Another thing is, even though this is an over read headphone it is not that big, so some part of my ear gets a bit uncomfortable after long use, but if u adjust and find the correct comfortable position, you cab wear it for a long time, I watched a 3 hr movie without any issues

Battery - omg, one of the best part of this headphone, claims 50 hr without noise cancellation, I think it lives upto the mark. You don't have to worry about battery

Sound quality - I'm not an audiophile, let me clear it up. The sound quality I felt was really good and I was very impressed, after the burn in period, so if you are buying this give it at least 1 week before judging it, trust me it really really gets better. The base was not that high, but not lacking also, was upto the mark.

Noise cancellation - it wasn't really that great, could slightly reduce the fan noise that's it, I wouldn't say it is useless, but not that bad either, could reduce the noise of tv from next room when I listened to music, so it did came in handy also with noise cancellation the sound quality I felt improved a bit.

Conclusion - as I said, I was really disappointed at first with the purchase, thought I wasted the money(6.5k) but now I'm really really enjoyed it, watching movies was the best experience with dolby music profile in my phone. I'd say it is really worth the money if ur looking for a headphone around 7k"
6037,4.0,"Review after using 2+ months. Earcups are not suitable for long time use. That pains to ears a lot.. Barring this no other complaint. Happy with the sound, NC, connectivity etc."
6038,3.0,"It’s uncomfortable; you can’t wear it for more than 1 hr in one go.
Sound quality is average.
No app support to control device.
No case is provided.
Looks average.
You can get better headphones in this range."
6039,4.0,"Using this product for 2 weeks. It's a 4.5 star product but not 5 star due to following reasons. I listen to music a lot, watch movies and also plays a lot of games. My experience is given below.

Cons.

1. Ear comfort ( 4.5 stars )- Although the product is extremely comfortable I have large ears so a little pain is there if I use it for prolonged periods (2 hour +). People with small to medium ear size may not have any problem with this. I will have to remove for a few minutes and then I can continue. The ear cushions are really soft and the comfort is so far the best.
2. Adding to the above point - if you are living in a relatively hot area, ears might sweat and may become uncomfortable. My place is 30+ degree Celsius always. In cooler climate the issue is not existing.
3. Audio quality is excellent but really minimal buzzing is there for deep bass. This will not be noticeable at all if you are playing music or gaming. For music and audio editing this may be an issue. Not sure if this is only there for my product. I am satisfied with the product so not returning it.
4. No next or prev buttons.

Pros.
1. Extremely long battery life and quick charging. I have been using the product for 4 days without recharging and is a huge plus. Not tested how many hours I get with ANC on but is pretty long. I use the headsets for 5-6 hours daily and is really good. Charging is pretty quick too.
2. ANC is really good. While I was traveling it was able to filter most of the traffic noice except really loud noises. People chatting and other noice is not at all audible so Mom might get angry ;)
3. Latency is really low. I was able to play pubg mobile with this and latency was almost undetected but it is there.
4. Audio quality is superb, bass is pretty good and is the best so far
5. Premium build quality. Weight is little high than the cheap plastic and fibre headsets. This one has metal frame.
6. Good range.
7. Nice fit. Not too tight not too loose."
6040,4.0,Happy to use
6041,3.0,I have not received C-USB Charging cable along with this kit pack. I could not connect it in my mobile but I could connect it in my computer successfully.
6042,4.0,इस हेडफोन को लेने का मेरा मुख्य आशय noise cancellation था। इस संदर्भ में इसका कार्य औसत कोटि का है । इसके अतिरिक्त ब्ल्यूटूथ अथवा ध्वनि गुणवत्ता के संदर्भ में ये उच्च कोटि का है । वस्तुतः इस दायरे में noise cancellation मिलना कठिन है ।
6043,4.0,
6044,3.0,sound is not what exactly I was assuming.... as per price sound quality should be more Cristal with high beats also
6045,3.0,"1 year review

Pros:
Battery backup is good, last atleast 1 week with ANC off.
Sound quality is good
Good gaming experience, very less lag
Used with laptops, mobile phones, ipad, no issues till now.

Cons
Not suitable for workouts, it will fall off.
ANC is not good."
6046,3.0,Not worth for spending so much money if you are buying for NC and deep bass music.
6047,4.0,"This is a first impression review, i could give it a better or weaker review later.

as soon as I got my hands on the device, I was impressed by the finish, it looks like it could last a while before wear starts to show, the driver cups are really free and allow for various positions, though they are a bit stiff, compared to the ones I was using.

Now for the sound.
oddly its got 2 sound modes.......let me elaborate

When you turn on the headphones for the first time, ANC will be on by default (canceled the sound of the ac and the fans completely )

in this mode, the bass is quite good but not overwhelming (if you are a bass head, look for something else, trust me)

but if you turn the ANC off, the bass take as nose dive and lands with a bellyflop. It seems to take a step back, and everything is more ""open""

and on the note of ANC, if you pass 80% volume with ANC on and playing music, the ANC will automatically disable itself and the light will stay on. you will have to turn off the headphones and turn them back on to get the ANC back ......weird

THIS IS BY NO MEANS BAD THOUGH ......if .....you are not a complete bass head and dont only seek bass (if you want bass more than everything else ......get skull candy crushers)

the mids and treble are maintained even if the ANC is off or on

Pairing is way too easy, its on my PC and phone, but the dual pairing has its fair bit of delay between switching the output (I haven't found the hang of it yet)"
6048,3.0,"Sound is ok , but bass is not as expected. The price is overrated as per its performance. with full volume the bass start cracking also."
6049,4.0,Sound via aux is not good.
6050,4.0,Bass could be better...rest all good
6051,5.0,"The sound of headphone is good i like it Bluetooth connectivity is great, only thing it lack is base. Build quality is oke , plastic body
Overall good product"
6052,4.0,"It works and thats all, decent sound but no tweak-able sound because no app support. Burn-in of driver is a must. Never faced any random disconnect so bluetooth works fine. They are comfortable for like about 1-2hrs for my head as of now maybe a little more use will loosen them."
6053,4.0,"I was in the market for a good cheap NC headphones. Obviously the dream was Sony XM4, but those were a little out of budget. So I went on the market, searching for HOURS, company after company, model after model, and I ended up here. And I must say I wasn’t disappointed. Now I’ve tried other NC headphones before, but the top of the line ones like Bose Quite or Apple AirPod max and these aren’t comparable to them at all ofc. I mean to be fair they are literally 1/5th the price. But they aren’t bad.

Talking about the noise cancellation, it’s nice but definitely doesn’t cancel all the sounds. The low pitched background noises that you hear in Indian senators, does a good job at masking that, I will give you that much, put high pitched non repetitive sounds like birds chirping or people talking, that you can definitely figure out. This I’m talking with the ANC on and the music off but as soon as the music turns on, Everything disappears, so that’s great. I was just a tad dissapointed cause I bought this so I can use it in trains and planes with loud noise and it does substantially decrease the sound but doesn’t cancel it fully

But THE BEST part about these headphones? The battery. Just spectacular. I have been using these for the last 10 days and lemme tell you, they came with 75% battery and I haven’t used them since. Just amazing. Now let’s see how long do they hold up and their durability only time will tell, which I will update for sure, but till them, I would definitely definitely recommend them."
6054,3.0,I had been using Bose QC 35 Ii from last 3 year and few days back It’s started connecting issues with my iPhone then I visited to the SC and Bose SC DM suggested me to replace the gadget with paying of 80% of the present QC 35ii cost and I thought it’s not worth to pay 25000 than I have gone through the review of this model it’s very good comparing to the price of BOse and i am using comfortably in weekend or travelling.
6055,5.0,The product quality is good but it is very uncomfortable to use due to stiffness and its weight.
6056,3.0,"ANC - Very Poor
Sound quality- not that much great, getting high sound in music over audio, calls are not good"
6057,3.0,Product is not working so kindly advise how to contact supplier as well as if it’s guarantee then at where to send for repairs
6058,3.0,There is bit dip in the device for charging. The device is not getting fully charged instead the led indicators are turning off while charging (indicates fully charged) but when I connect with my phone the battery indicator shows that the device needs to be sufficiently charged.
6059,3.0,"The sound quality is good, you can feel a surrounding effect, and the bass is OK (not too much), but the NC (noise cancellation) is not too good - 80-90% noise canceled.
Overall it is PERFECT."
6060,3.0,The bass is not that much on these headphones. It's a bit tight in the ear but the built quality is very good.
6061,3.0,"After Sennheiser, this is my second noise-canceling headphone. The headphone does a great job listening to music and is JBL Tune 756NC-certified. However, it is too small for large heads like mine. I recommend that you try Sennheiser headphones before you decide to buy this one."
6062,4.0,"Connectivity is good and faster. ANC works good. For this rate this is the maximum ANC you can get but still soo good enough. Battery is far better. Continuously you can use it for 24hrs. The only CON is, the bass is a bit low. But That's ok. This is enough I often hear songs with high bass so it's low for me. If the bass was enough I would have given 5/5.

Also FYI, The maximum device we can connect at a time is 2. If u want to connect another, u need to disconnect on any one."
6063,4.0,"Review after a month use :)

JBL 760ANC BT headphone

Initially though i was disappointed with sound, dont know why, but now i feel the audio is good. The frequency range is high i think as each instruments are highlighted instead of thrown at once. I like that. Mild bass . I like this bass better than jbl infinity where it vibrates and hurt ears at high volume.

Noise cancellation
I dont know why they implemented ANC here as nothing as get past the ear cup. Your ears fit perfectly well into their cup. So comfortable.and then you have to give some time to adapt.

Media
Watching movies is a delight in this jbl 760anc BT headphone. Be it Guitar pieces , glass breaks ,vocals, edm everything is beautifully presented to you giving life to the movie.
MUSIC is nothing short of wonder. I have vibed with kabira,subhanalla, infected mushroom heavy weight (9 mins of soul dance).

Battery
It is a beast in this section.i cant remember the last time i put charge to this monster.i really hate headphones stuttering batterylow batterylow amidst a movie. They have battery for saying that nonsense but not play the movie.lol. but i know iam in safe hands now.

Charge
Its a type c port .tat is awesome

Verdict
Get the headphone with a right kidney.wont regret it !"
6064,4.0,Noise Cancellation is not very effective
6065,3.0," This is my first over ear headphones, and I’m writing review after a few days of usage. Sound quality good, noise cancellation (even a beginner can feel) could have done better, but maybe good for this cost. I bought this specifically for calls, because airpods perform worse, with previous the other side is not able to hear my voice properly - This headphone is not giving me such issues. I even used this for my office calls, no one complained for any background noise. It is perfect of you want to have long calls. Although, you may get a tad tired after putting it on for a few hours, I like to take a break. Battery is good so far, I keep ANC turned off unless I’m out. As you can see in video, it can be packed neatly too. No complaints so far"
6066,4.0,"I was searching for some noise cancelling headphones that didn’t give me a headache, and I found them. They connect easily to my phone and computer. I didn’t realize until later that they’re supposed to come with an audio cable, but mine didn’t. It’s also not the typical 3.5mm port, so I’m struggling to find the right cable so I can use them on planes and whenever else I want it wired. If they actually came with the cable I’d likely be a lot happier with the purchase."
6067,5.0,Even sony xb55ap in ear earphones are much better sounding and stronger bass than this headphones
6068,4.0,"If you an Apple device then I don’t recommend this product.
It works very good with android but sound quality is very poor when using with an Apple device."
6069,3.0,"The noise cancellation is not good as it only cancels out small things like fan sound, the noise cancellation gets turned off automatically when you increase the volume above 80% which you have to do quite often as the speakers are not very loud. Also I would have liked a bit more bass. The battery life is amazing, I can survive about 3 to 4 days without charging them in one go."
6070,4.0,Sound volume 100 too low
6071,4.0,"50 hours battery
Earphones Jak
Aur kuch nhi hai."
6072,3.0,"Sound? CRISP and beautiful. Cinema-quality if you're watching TV etc. No lag. I got these as a gift for my mum on her birthday and unfortunately I had to return these because they gave her a bad headache. The problem is the fit (sits heavy on the head) and the earcups didn't cover her ear all the way. So UNLESS you have small ears, you may also experience the same issues. Battery is GREAT! ANC is good but nothing exceptional. You do need to spend a bit more to get superb ANC but at 6500 it's fairly decent! Sad to have to return these. There is a bit of sound leakage at high volumes, but you have to be very close to the person to hear it."
6073,4.0,"Headset cup sponge later peeling off, quality. Apart from that headset quality and bass good."
6074,3.0,I like noise canceling because canceled sounds like drilling and boring construction building houses happening in my neighborhood Bluetooth connect to Android devices is quick but with iPhone not quick and sometimes manually do to connect sound quality is great
6075,4.0,"Noise cancellation is below par...rest all options are just ok. Also head phones are on the heavier side and takes time to adjust. Would suggest to look for other options. Cannot mute calls, Zoom, teams meeting calls from headphones"
6076,3.0,GOOD PRODUCT
6077,4.0,"JBL is known for its sound engineering and build quality in budget and higher-end audio products.
No less in this too, this is a very nice headset to use if you like to have proper audio experiences, my reason to pick this was for video editing and it has done a good job in that.
Regarding the Noise canceling part you just get 1 level On and Off, with no app support this is a bit disappointing, and please note this is not an ANC - Active Noise Canceling so do not expect much from this headset towards Noise-canceling
My other disappointment was with AMAZON as when I purchased this had an offer of a Time Prime Subscription and Zomota coupon, I did not receive any of it and when I reached out to them now they are asking for proof of the offer mentioned."

6147,4.0,"This headphone has good battery backup, good range, good sound but not for music listeners who like bass because this headphone doesn't have that bass as you would get in a earphone. And its uncomfortable for ears to wear it for long time, its clamping force is high i suggest to buy some comfortable ear padding and replace it."
6148,4.0,"Everything is the best in this headphones, but yes the build quality could improve a lot.Otherwise the sound quality,bass quality,noise cancellation is all great in this price range."
6149,4.0,"Looks good, bass is just ok, not much comfort but sound is good. Microphone for calling is not so good. 4 star rating for looks, sound and price."
6150,3.0,Great for online meetings and good for little binge watching with in rupees 750 i have bought
6151,4.0,"Bass quality is great, Good pick for this price. Even charge is standing for long hours..."
6152,4.0,Total plastic material...
6153,4.0,Sound quality is good... Compare to price noice and md bass is good
6154,4.0,I like the product but not so comfortable.
6155,4.0,Good product with this price range
6156,4.0,"1) The quality of sound is good, and battery goes longer.
2) Mic not good, the other person cannot hear,
3) Feel bit tightness on head.
My old JBL 460T was far better here, no such issues. So will buy that again.

Good if you want to just hear the music, not good for office calls."
6157,4.0,"This product is overall good. Because of it's price, it has a good bass also."
6158,4.0,"The product is good but the build quality is average. At this price range, this build quality is expected.
Sound quality is also good and I experienced noise cancellation.

We can't wear the headphones for more than 1.5hours. It starts paining after 1.5-2hours."
6159,4.0,Overall nice headphones but poor noise Cancellation.
6160,3.0,It's a good headphone for daily use.
6161,4.0,Overall performance is really nice 👍. I recommend you to order this product. Value for money. Bass is really osm in this price segment
6162,3.0,love how its lightweight ..it doesnt feels like you are actually wearing a headphone...the main problem when u wear it for a long time your ears will hurt from outside other then that great loved it
6163,4.0,No noise cancellation use as only to listen song
6164,4.0,Very good product
6165,4.0,Good
6166,4.0,"Sound quality, Bluetooth connectivity and bass quality are all good. It is light weight. Battery life is also great.
The only thing I didn't like about this product is that it's not very comfortable. The more we use it gets loose and slips of the ears as it has a plastic body."
6167,5.0,"Only issue is when charging, the light indicator not working."
6168,4.0,"Very nice poduct but the sound I expected to be more. I expected to be more,the sound is ok amplitude is too ok but expected to be more amplitude overall bought it for 700 bcoz there was an offer in big billion days even you can buy to for 800 to 900.This is what I'm telling but normally the price is 1000 but after buying it for 700 I am wanting it for 600 😂 . go for it not bad upto 800 -900 rs it totally worth it.
Note-****The picture of the product I'll add later after about few months of use (so that we can check that whether colour is fading too much or not , working headphone or not etc.)****"
6169,3.0,Comfort
6170,4.0,It is very tight on ears.
6171,4.0,Ok
6172,4.0,Good product. Bass quality is nice. Sound clarity is good.
6173,4.0,"Awesome product ❤loved it , sound quality is on another level and battery backup is also good, best product in this price. But there is a minor problem when I play on full volume there is a kind of vibrating sound in it which is annoying. ❤"
6174,4.0,It’s good
6175,4.0,Battery drain out fast . Good asthetic appeal . Asked for green option send me black . Any way it’s ok . Not very fancy but works fine . Over rating 3 of 5
6176,4.0,"If you a music lover or having lots of calls, you can consider this budget friendly and soft headphones,
I can wear it 3-4 hours continuously and hardly any pain in my ears,

Prons :
Good base
Very soft
Good battery backup
Have aux connectivity
Decent look

Cons :
-You can't fold it
-Sometime Bluetooth connectivity issues, specially with macbook, I tried with 2 macbooks and have same issue of connectivity breaks, working fine with any other os or machine"
6177,4.0,"Sound quality and noise cancellation are fine but it does not fit perfectly in the ear thus causing mild irritation, joints seem a bit weak which could have been more durable. Aux cable support comes in very handy to me so it's a go for me."
6178,4.0,"I liked the product except that I find the voice announcements annoying. I would be grateful is there is a way to cancel it. It's the most annoying when it says in a very loud voice 'MIMIMUM VOLUME'. Sometimes I reduce the volume to the minimum level because I don't want the audio, but ironically the announcement comes in the loudest volume level at that time. Also, I don't understnd fully what it says because it is in a US accent. So it's not much useful for me."
6179,4.0,"First day review: Used it continues for 10 hours today I'm amazed with its comfort, battery life and easy connectivity. The headset isn't dual connect as you may see in a few reviews here. Charges very fast, under 2 hours for full charge, and use it long hours. I've connected it to my TV, awesome range and decent sound quality, bass is also decent. Surely it's a great buy for the price, go ahead!"
6180,4.0,Personally I'm very satisfied from amazon as well as from boat also coz from boat it's my first product and i can say yes! It's the brand you can trust atleast in their sound quality. Although when i got the product I've faced an little problem then i immediate raise an complaint in amazon and from amazon i got quick respond then they have replaced the product with in 2 days only!
6181,4.0,I like the sound output
6182,4.0,"Bluetooth is connecting two device at a time. Good sound, nice bass."
6183,4.0,Sound quality was good because it'll damage in 3 months and I was apply my warranty card then it'll repaired in 1 month😂
6184,4.0,"I bought these in October 2020 for 1500₹. I am not a tech Guru but I liked the sound quality, also found them comfortable and the battery backup is just amazing 😌. Its one side broke in September 2022 when I accidentally sat on it. That's its weakest point where the headphones and band joins as it is made of plastic and this is the most complaint issue by most of the people . I'm sure it would not break just by using it only if you try to break them or whatever you should not do with a headphone. So if you want to buy it buy it for sure but just don't throw it anywhere and don't sit on it I still regret that😭😭. And don't get scared that they will break, simply take care of them. Lastly don't buy it for over 1500 if it is over 1500 wait for the sales."
6185,4.0,The pad skin is extremely thin and weak. It got teared apart in first 3 month only. It is something which is irreparable and should have been built with quality. Still the headphone is working. It has been 1.5 years in use.
6186,4.0,Bluetooth connection lost with LG TV. Sound is more for volume 12 in teams connection and receiver always complain that voice low or from well
6187,4.0,"All things is avg,but very comfortable"
6188,4.0,"Yeah!! Bro,
boat rockers 550 over ear model are fantastic.
Bluetooth connectivity is stunning.
Sound quality is best but sound quality could be more best . Bass quality is not best.
Sound leakage is more more.
And finally boAt rocketz 550 over ear is built quality is best . according to money. Thnxxx"
6189,4.0,Like it
6190,4.0,"The Build quality is very poor, Never purchase this product. It broke in a 3 month even I was using this very carefully. It broke because the plastic used at that point is very weak and cheap.

I am soo much trapped after purchasing this as they will not give service because it is considered as physical damage and I can't use it anymore. A complete waste of money."
6191,4.0,I always choose boat coz they give the best sound quality
6192,4.0,"Writing it after 2month use.
Satisfied with price & comparative features under the same.
Only voice calling sometimes has issue with low voice at other end."
6193,4.0,Thanks for it amazon ...its really very soft and cancell the noise easily
6194,4.0,"Boat rockrez 550 is the product which is very good according to price and it's very comfortable you can use it over a long period,
and it noice cancellation is also good .
And the overall review is , this boat head is very product in rhis price os range and quality of cushion used is very good and comfortable,so you can purchase this 🎧."
6195,4.0,"it has a good matte finish, amd soft ear cushions, though it might hurt after some time of using, but its manageable. Moreover I tried google assistant using the headphone, it sounded very bad. Otherwise the product is good."
6196,4.0,Noise cancellation wasn't up to the mark!
6197,4.0,"Nice one , serves its purpose."
6198,4.0,Its good got the required bass sound but not fully noise cancellation can be heard some noise but would still rate 4 star because of sound quality
6199,4.0," condition after 9 months:
1.Sound quality is good.
2.Bluetooth connectivity is good.
3.buy it if you have no problems with long term use because after long time i presses skull around ear which make it uncomfortable.
4.Agar sahi se chalo ge to koi problem nahi aegi."
6200,3.0, Nice headphones for this price and this product build impressed and sound quality very nice and looking was so awesome
6201,4.0,"I have 2 other earphones in the house a senhiser 220 which is 7 years old and going strong and moto 4 years old.
One very odd thing i found in this one is this actually sounds beeter over bluetooth than wired.... Tested on samsung a52 which has excellent 3.5 connectivity. With cord sound is avg. The sound stage is okish. The depth is good bass and treble i. e good enough for 60s to 90s songs. ARR also sounds good. Slow rock (MLTR) is above avg and recent tamil songs are good. All comparisions with the other 2 head phones. I am a purist and do not prefer heavy bass. This will appeal to such lot."
6202,4.0,I love Boat .. but a bit disappointed with this headphones .. i had high expectations... sound quality
6203,4.0,Quality of sound is good but the sound isolation is not much better...... Sound comes outside clearly..... Build quality not best but good..... Mic not available in this product....
6204,4.0,"Because it heats up our ears in 10 minutes.
I am in ear user , so will be fine later
I am reviewing after pTron Dual Driver
Purchase date : 8.11.22
Received Date : 12.11.22
Price : 1270.34 + GST 228.66 =1499
Review after : 2 day
I feels it's 50mm driver which makes bold or big sound and sound is very clear and bass mid high are similar
This is best for normal usses
It shows battery charge percentage in phone But there is no indication on charging time and play times always blinks blue light.
This steel blade is for show only which overlaps on the plastic.
It's 10% = 3 hour
I bought it because of the huge difference between 1 star to 5 star.
I think it is the king of over ear headphone who makes me boat fan I have never heard this kind of sound.

Cons
Heats up our ears
There is no indication on charging time
In Playing time Continuously blinks blue light
When it conected automatically increase full volume"
6205,4.0,Like
6206,4.0,I liked the product very much. Although it was kinda tight when I frist wore now it seems okay. I don't know if there is no inbuilt mic in this. But this actually works in favor for me because my phone's mic quality is really good and I wanted to use my phone's mic with headset and now I am able to do that
6207,4.0,It's a budget headphone. Don't expect too much out of it especially if you're looking for bass. Else everything is good. Just the colors shown in the picture are little dark but for actual product it's little faint.
6208,4.0,ok so the build quality is 9/10 comfortness 10/10 sound quality 8/10 crisp highs great mids and not oversatured bass only problem i face when i connect it to aux cable on my pc everything sound output and quality suddendly decrease beside that its a great product connectivity is also good you can buy it
6209,4.0,"Its sound quality is good
Connets with bluetooth
very comfortable to wear"
6210,3.0,"Headphone has a good Bluetooth connectivity and noise cancellation. For gamers it has latency issues, but it can be avoided by using an AUX cable.

6211,4.0,Think for its
6212,3.0,AMAZING SOUND AND PERFOEMANCE
6213,4.0,Bass is little slow.
6214,4.0,Good Head phone in this price
6215,4.0,"I am reviewing this after using it for 1 month
Pros:
1. Very comfortable because the foam material is very soft
2. The sound quality is excellent
3. The battery backup is soo good like I can use this for all day with only 1 hour of charging but don't use it all day as it affects the battery
4. It's light weight and easy to carry around
5. It looks very nice and premium if you use it in the gym

Cons:
1. It's ear cushions are very soft like extra soft than other headphones so I feel like they can tear off if you use it roughly
2. Mic quality is not very good

But it over-all is the best product in this range if you get it in 1500"

6219,3.0,Sound gd but microphone not satisfying
6220,4.0,I have been using this headphone for a year now. In one year all the cloths given above the coushin of the headphone or whatever it is called came off. Sometimes it automatically get disconnected then you have to manually connect it again. Talking about the battery it is pretty good. Battery performance didn't depleted much in this much of time. Sound quality is also good you will get enough bass. Only problem is that mic is not so good and Bluetooth sometimes get disconnected automatically and coushins are not so good. Sound and battery life is good. I would recommend if you have budget under 2000 then definitely go for this one unless you want to record your voice using this headphone. You can use this headphone for calling. Also If you are a hardcore music lover the. You may get little disappointment bass is good but not that much and after one year the bass has become less.
6221,4.0,"I never expected this type of quality. Every thing is just perfect . Bass , clearity , volume , battery everything is perfect. When you hear bass boosted songs than you feel vabration on your ears and personality i like it . And who are gamer for that boAt giving aux cable when you use it you have no problem on gaming no latency . And when you play with aux cable I feel the volume is little down than Bluetooth volume but its enough for gaming . Personally I use 40% sound for gaming and its really clear no need to volume it up . ☺️"

Coming to the bad points.
Build Quality is a little Cheap according to the price , the hinges shouldn't be used that much it will lose it's grip.
Also the Bluetooth is not that grt , if you are on a vehicle and connected your phone you will hardly hear any song.
The connectivity is a issue. The dual connect is good but their is a latency of about 2-3 second when switching from one to another.

That's all, You can buy this if your budget is less and as a student this is the best headphones at this price range."
6277,4.0,"It's quite good to use with really good sound quality. But as i have used other headphones before, i found a bit bass and empathy of sound missing. I can hear a bit noice even on full volume. Sometimes it also doesn't connect with laptop using aux cable.
When there's low nattery and we put headphone on charging, it gets disconnected. We can't use it while it is being charged.
Otherwise, great comfort, light weight, clear sound and easy to use."
6278,4.0,"You won't be dissatisfied at all after spending 500 on it
• sound is good
• comfortable
• battery is good
• micro sd works good
• all features at this price range is perfect

Drawbacks :
• people sitting on next to you can hear what you're listening to
• noise cancellation is zero
• microphone catches all the sounds in background
• the micro sd card and radio operates in full volume there is no option to lessen the volume

Timely Delivery by Amazon.
Packaging was not so ideal from Amazon.
About the product:
Quality is as per price.
Accessories are of low quality espically the Auxiliary Cord,
Poor sound quality from aux cable.
The charging cord is also if low quality it's hard to connect it to the headset and you dear damaging the ear cushion.
I already have a micro USB cable which fits with ease and effective.
It's not a quick charging modle, takes approximately 2-2.5 hours for charging.
When i received the product it had no charging. First experience that the product has no charging.
The actual build quality of the headset is quite mediocre,
It's all plastic, the cushions are not firmly fixed.
Little gaps between base and cushions.
Charging indicator is present and also full charging indicator.
Ear cushion quality looks decent.
It's has FM function which is totally not workings,my area of residence has a fairly good reception of GM signal but the product fails to catch signal.
Bluetooth connectivity is excellent, it's quick and fast and without any delay.

About sound quality:
Sound quality is excellent for watching movies or web series or any video content.
It delivers very clear and crisp sound without letting the bgm over powering dialogues.
Music with aux cord is way below average avoid it try with some other aux cord (haven't tried yet)
Sound quality with Bluetooth entirely depends upon the music source music settings.
Like redmi phones have headphones selection option which enhances it's performance and even with Equalizer settings.
But it's not that thumping or thunderous.
My old leaf headset gives excellent quality.
Bass is limited and sometimes feels ok.
Treble is controlled which is a boon.
Decent battery back up.
Not that heavy which is a plus.

Over all , don't expect a out of the world experience.
It delivers what is claims but with limitations."
6280,4.0,"Sound quality is amazing over AUX but in BT,it is not good(you have to download 'EQ for BT' app from playstore to sound good), i think it depends on phone... I am using Redmi Note 7 pro, so it doesn't showing Equalizer in BT mode but in AUX it is there... So tweaking EQ, makes it perfect...
Bass is very very good, you will appreciate it. Trebble is average, you can increase using EQ. Vocal is also good.
Surround sound is quite good, instrument seperation is very good...
It is very loud and no distortion at 100% volume, You will not listen beyond 60% volume.
Mic quality is ok.. mic will not work in AUX mode, it will capture through phone mic. During phone call Mic is working, over BT only...(over AUX it is using phone mic, or you can use AUX cable with mic)

It also have SD card slot, u don't need to connect BT.

It is first impression, so i cannot say about battery life or any other problem, i'll update in future..
Edit: Battery backup is approx 16-18hr as i have noticed.(continuously 6 hr per day for 3 day still 10% left but at 10% it is always saying Power Low which is irritating....)

Sound quality is just Wow(specially Bass)... you will not regret...
Build quality is ok(for this price), feels little bit after 2-3hrs.

After apply coupon, i got 119₹ discount.. so it is best for me at this price...

Update: After 6days, i have replaced with new one because Right side driver producing a little bit low sound (15% less volume than Left side).
Thanks to Amazon for replacement. Now, new one is OK, after 15days no issues, i'll update in future if any..."
6281,4.0,"I bought these at 499, and at this price these headphones are great.
I'm not a heavy user so battery life of 7-8 hours roughly lasts 2-3 days which is fine for most cases.
One problem I find is that the earcuffs tend to come off which causes some trouble, but it takes just 2 min to put them back on. But still it's frustating.

Sound quality is better than average for this price range.

UPDATE:20/01/2018
-------------------------------------------------
It's been 5 months since I first got Boat Rockerz 400. Some of the dislikes I've mentioned earlier in my review are no more dislikes. I said the sound is more or less on a flatter side but I'm quite used to it and ""I'm loving it"".. :) the Second point is I said if you are an audiophile then you may not like it but I was wrong. You might ask why... Here is why:

After a long gap, I visited my Father who is an audiophile. He has numerous high-end headphones but unfortunately, he got the attention of my headphone and he just wanted to try it. I said yes (I regret it :( ) he paired it with his device and played a song. Boy!! you got to see the grin on his face :D. He said I'm keeping it you buy another one. Poor me was forced to buy another one. A few days back I got another one :(
One thing I noticed in two of my purchase is
THE AUDIO CABLE IS NO GOOD. Both my audio cable had the same issue.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
So the moral of the story is: Hide it from your audiophile Dad or brother.. they will unceremoniously snatch it from you.
Jokes apart, people, you can't go wrong with this purchase. It's worth every square inch.

Happy Shopping...
END OF UPDATE
---------------------------------------------------

I got this product 3 days back, and I got it for Rs. 1299( lightning deal of course) This is an honest unbiased review keeping in mind the price of the product:

Three days might not be a sufficient time to review this product but sorry I can't help the excitement...
----------------------------------------------------
Likes:
1> Good built quality------- 4/5
It is sturdy, for the price the build quality is great. It is not flimsy. The ear cushions are good enough.
------------------------------------------------------
2> Sound quality------3.5/5
If you are an audiophile this is not for you. Bass is decent nothing to go overboard( as noticed in other reviews). Bass is deep enough for the price.
---------------------------------------------------------
3> Connectivity: pairing is easy connects like a breeze.------ 4/5
----------------------------------------------------------
4> Dual Mode- Wired and wireless: Boat rockerz 400 comes with an aux cable.If you run out of charge you could always connect the aux cable and use it as a wired headphone. ( I couldn't find a substantial difference in the quality of music between wired and wireless though :) ) I absolutely loved this feature. ------5/5
-----------------------------------------------------------
Battery backup: I'm impressed with the battery backup of this beast. I've been using it for 3 days for 2-3 hrs a day still its running. So i guess the 8 hr backup per charge is not a marketing gimmick I presume it's true. So far so good. will update it after a month's usage.
------------------------------------------------------------
Dislikes:
1> Sound quality is more on the flatter side. When you compare it with budget wired headphones like Sennheiser CX 180 Street II bass is not too deep. You won't get that ambiance. Boat's website says:""Don't just be loud, be loud and clear"", Nope... sorry I've to disappoint you on this. When it's loud it's not at all clear. A lot of distortions are there when you are loud.
-----------------------------------------------------------
2> Comfort: Believe me, it's not at all comfortable for prolonged usage. Your ear will beg you to take it off after 30-45 mins.. If you have high fortitude you can push it till 1-1.20 hrs... If you could go more than that without taking it off for a minute then you are superhuman...
-----------------------------------------------------------
3> Range: Boats says 10 meters range... In my experience, if you go beyond 5-6 meters then the voice will break. You will never ever get 10 mtrs range trust me on that. And I'm experiencing occasional breaks in the streaming nothing intrusive so far but I don't know whether it will be a problem down the line. Will let you guys know about it later if it's a problem.
-------------------------------------------------------------
4>Flimsy aux cable: I can't complain too much about the aux cable keeping the price in mind. Remember I paid only 1299 for it. But with certain devices, the aux was not working properly. Mi note 3 had issues, Mi 4 also had issues with aux. Not sure whether it's the problem with my device. But it worked flawlessly on my laptop.
--------------------------------------------------------------
5> Wafer thin service centers: Boat gives 1 yr warranty but what good is it if you can't find any service centers near you. This is a hit or miss guys...
---------------------------------------------------------------
6> Voice cancellation: I didn't find this effective. Maybe it's just me, not sure.
----------------------------------------------------------------
7> Microphone is pretty much useless. You can't make calls with this headset.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Some alternatives:( These are all wired headphones, comparing them with a wireless may not be a good idea but still, I compare it with them because Boat rockerz comes with an aux cable, and if you are looking for an alternative irrespective of wired or wireless it might be of some use to you)
1>Sennheiser CX 180 Street II : I don't think Boat can beat this one's quality. The sound is incomparable- the base is deep, nice fidelity, nice ambiance and for a price of 799 this is unbeatable budget wired in-ear headphone. I own 2 of this beauty. Total value for money. If you are an audiophile and are on a tight budget then I can't a better alternative than this.
2> SoundMagic E10C In-Ear Headphones with Mic (Black/Gold): This is another TVFM earphone

3>Sony Extra Bass MDR-XB250 On-Ear Headphones
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Don't buy it:
1> If you are an audiophile ( obviously audiophiles will go only for wired headphones :D )
2> If you intend to use it for long hours.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Buy it:
1> If you are looking for a budget wireless headphone with decent built quality and performance.
2> If you require a wired and wireless package in one.
.-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Verdict: I'd give this headphone a score of 3.75/ 5
If you are on a budget and you want to enjoy a hassle-free Bluetooth headphone with good performance then CLOSE YOUR EYES AND BUY THIS BEAST trust me you won't regret it you won't be disappointed. In this price range, I couldn't find any other headphone with such a performance. We don't have many options.... Do we? :P :P

The actual price is Rs. 2999 and Amazon claim they are giving 57% discount. pls don't fall for that. I would not recommend paying more than 1700 rupees for this headphone.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

6376,4.0,"These are good for music,movies etc.
There is only one prob in this headphones Roughness in the cushion and it gives pain in the ear
As it is a on ear headset, my ear pains a lot while wearing them, I have to set it up a little every 15 to 20 min.
I am telling you this as a 14 year old kiddo whose ears are small. Your only prob will be the pain in the ear and if you are a teenager maybe your jaw below your ear too. Cushions are not too soft but it would work
Bass quality is good as it is so tight to the ears, Sound is good, Mic is balanced.Great product under 1000.
GO FOR IT. (Unless and until you don't care about your ears it is)"

6389,4.0,"1.I like the product very much because it is noise canceling very well.
2. When you are always in a online meet then it will definitely help you rather than in ear headphones.
Cons:-
1. When you wear for long time your ears gets hurted, so take break after 15 min.
2. The fitting quality becomes weak as headphones becomes loose."

6405,4.0,"Connectivity slower but okay, backup good, sound good. But annoying thing is always broken headband"
6406,4.0,"I used these headphones primarily for listening to music and watching movies and used them through my phone, laptop and Fire TV through both wired and wireless modes. I use Spotify and Amazon Music to listen to music. I am writing this review 14 months after making the purchase. This is not the only Boat product I own. I also have their cheap BassHeads 100 and their wireless Rockerz 225. I have owned several pairs of Sennheisers earphones and headphones in the past and currently use AKG K361s.

1. Decent battery life. You can charge it once and won't have to charge it again for a long time. The battery life has remained the same even a year after using them. A big achievement for cheap headphones.

2. These headphones are good if you want to watch movies, listen to podcasts, take phone calls or any other use case where instruments aren't involved. However, if listening to music is a priority, I would suggest you to stay away from them. The sound quality is bad. These headphones are bassy and it's poorly executed. The bass isn't tight, it's loose and lacks punch. It is overpowering and muddies the entire soundtrack.

If you listened to EDM or hip hop I guess it you won't notice the overpowering bass but if you listen to R&B, pop, rock or any other genre you'll notice it. The headphone emphasizes all lower frequencies and not just the drums.

For instance, if I listen to All I Ask by Adele, which is performed on a piano, it makes the piano chords sound heavy. The headphones emphasize bass over vocals. I encountered the same when I listened to Bollywood songs like Teri Mitti or Ve Maahi from Kesari. The lower frequencies overpowered the beautiful vocals. The headphones hide vocals in the mix rather than making them front and center like they should do.

I also frequently listen to Fleetwood Mac, Daft Punk, Beatles that make you feel as if you are surrounded by music. However, these headphones are really bad at creating that effect. The headphone speaker is so close to your ear, you don't get that 3D effect at all. All you have to do is listen to Hotel California once on these headphones and compare it to a higher grade product to know what I'm talking about.

3. Design: Remember I mentioned these headphones are good for movies and podcasts? Well, they aren't if you plan to listen to hour-long podcast episodes or watch complete movies at one go. These headphones are really tight on your ears. Even after a year of using them on a daily basis, they still feel tight. I wear spectacles so it's especially uncomfortable for me for long sessions. While it may be seen as a positive as it blocks the outside noise, I used them indoors so this didn't matter to me.

The padding on earcups and headband is good but the force exerted is still too much. I suspect the on-ear design is not only the culprit for making them uncomfortable but for its flawed sound.

The headphones are made of plastic and my pair works fine but there are plenty of videos on Youtube that show them breaking in the headband region at which point you have to throw them in the bin even if they work. The volume, power, call end buttons are located on the right earcup. I would have preferred if they were on both ears.

Verdict: These are not worth spending money. If you want headphones, I would strongly recommend you to buy Sennheiser headphones. They are more expensive but their sound and 2-year warranty makes up for the price difference. I have doubts any wireless headphones at this price point sound as good as wired Sennheiser headphones. If wireless connectivity is a must, then buy the Rockerz 225 available at the same price. They go inside your ear, create good isolation and sound much better. The only thing these are better at 225s is battery life and the option to connect them to your phone through a wire."
6407,4.0,This product is amazing.... I love it ..
6408,4.0,"I just love the quality & sound quality of the headphone. This was the first time I bought from the boat and I'm proud to say, I just love the brand so much that I can not think of any other brand when it's come to music tech."
6409,4.0,"As i expected from this product and it didnt let me down
little issue while connecting to pc and sometimes latency as well
allover great product

6411,4.0, Every thing is good . Worth buying.
6412,4.0,guys I have brought this boat headphones ...they were awesome .superb sound quality and..bass but they only thing was the cloth on the headphone making sweat and also they are small in size... so there ear pain what wearing for long hours....but this product was good one
6413,4.0,It has a nice finishing look and premium quality. Best thing is it’s lightweight and it has pretty good noise cancellation atleast for this range of price. Value for money i would say….
6414,4.0,"Being wireless headphones, I was bit unsure of the output, battery longivity and the strength of the product prior purchasing it. The following review is after 2 months of normal every day of usage of 1 and half hours during my commute.

Sound quality
-----------------

Positives
-----------

1. The output of music is fine and decent.
2. Syncs well with every genre quite well to give a balanced sound output.
3. The quality of the sound is deliverd as it should even at high volume level prohibiting any kind of distortion during playback.

Negatives
------------

1. When connected via Bluetooth, if you are using online music apps say gaana for streaming music and you want to toggle to a chat app say watsapp or the sms interface to write a message, a slight attenuation of sound is heard when the headphone is trying to switch from music playback to capture and play the keypress sounds through them.
2. At low volume, noise cancellation is not effective enough irrespective of the genre being played.

Battery life
--------------

Positives
-----------

1. As I have mentioned before, I use them almost 1 hour and 30 minutes in a day for 5 days a week which turns out to be 7 hours and 30 minutes as total usage once I charge them full. Although I charge them after the fifth day of use but then also the battery is not low which requires immediate attention and charge.
2. It is great battery performance for what the company claims and for being a budget Bluetooth headphone.
3. Even if some one who is a heavy user and find their headphone as their best companion for 8-9 hours a day, once charged full, it will keep you entertained for a good amount of time.
4. The headphone can be used wirelessly even if it is on charge (NOT ADVISABLE).

Negatives
------------

1. There is no way or an indicator to check the status of remaining charge of the battery and estimate the time to go zero.
2. I have observed the charging time from 0% to 100% takes almost 2 hours and some minutes. So, please make a note of it.

Material quality
-------------------

1. The design is simple and is sturdy.
2. The cushion at the over head band is ok and gives optimum comfort.
3. The height adjustable extenders seems to be metal which makes product feel strong and promising for a good amount of time.
4. I have read multiple reviews where they say the cushions on the driver is painful initially and persists if used for long period. As the drivers are of standard size and not too big, if not placed correctly on the ears, may create pain for few. As it is greatly adjustable, just make sure you are expanding the sides of the headphone fully and just gently keep them on the ears. Do not press them inwards with your hands much. Thus, you can get good comfort and enjoy your music.

My final verdict
-------------------

I am having no complaints about it's built quality, sound quality and battery performance. For a even better experience, I may upgrade to an expensive and high quality product some other time if I need to. But, I am convinced to a considerable extent with the headphones."
6415,4.0,Go for it using it for past 1 year good battery life
6416,4.0,"It is good for beginners
These were my first headphones and I'm satisfied with them plus the rate is applicable too.
Firstly it might hurt a little in ears as it is tight but slowly you'll be getting habit of it so have patience.
Sound, bass all are ok for me and i will recommend it to you also.
I got em for 899/-
(^_^)"
6417,4.0,This product battery and sound quality is very good
6418,4.0,Gr8
6419,4.0,"While connected to laptop changes quality of sound now and then
Dont know if only for 1 product"
6420,4.0,"The sound quality is as expected but in my case aux mode wasn't working so I ordered a replacement .
They took my headphones and it's been 10 days and I recieved my replacement with the same fault .

I'm gonna test with another aux cable . May be the cable is faulty .

But I will never order from Amazon again .
Such a worst replacement experience as compared to flipkart ."
6421,4.0,My opinion for this is very good 😃
6422,4.0,"-------------------------------------------------
UPDATE:20/01/2018
-------------------------------------------------
It's been 5 months since I first got Boat Rockerz 400. Some of the dislikes I've mentioned earlier in my review are no more dislikes. I said the sound is more or less on a flatter side but I'm quite used to it and ""I'm loving it"".. :) the Second point is I said if you are an audiophile then you may not like it but I was wrong. You might ask why... Here is why:

After a long gap, I visited my Father who is an audiophile. He has numerous high-end headphones but unfortunately, he got the attention of my headphone and he just wanted to try it. I said yes (I regret it :( ) he paired it with his device and played a song. Boy!! you got to see the grin on his face :D. He said I'm keeping it you buy another one. Poor me was forced to buy another one. A few days back I got another one :(
One thing I noticed in two of my purchase is
THE AUDIO CABLE IS NO GOOD. Both my audio cable had the same issue.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
So the moral of the story is: Hide it from your audiophile Dad or brother.. they will unceremoniously snatch it from you.
Jokes apart, people, you can't go wrong with this purchase. It's worth every square inch.

Happy Shopping...
END OF UPDATE
---------------------------------------------------

I got this product 3 days back, and I got it for Rs. 1299( lightning deal of course) This is an honest unbiased review keeping in mind the price of the product:

Three days might not be a sufficient time to review this product but sorry I can't help the excitement...
----------------------------------------------------
Likes:
1> Good built quality------- 4/5
It is sturdy, for the price the build quality is great. It is not flimsy. The ear cushions are good enough.
------------------------------------------------------
2> Sound quality------3.5/5
If you are an audiophile this is not for you. Bass is decent nothing to go overboard( as noticed in other reviews). Bass is deep enough for the price.
---------------------------------------------------------
3> Connectivity: pairing is easy connects like a breeze.------ 4/5
----------------------------------------------------------
4> Dual Mode- Wired and wireless: Boat rockerz 400 comes with an aux cable.If you run out of charge you could always connect the aux cable and use it as a wired headphone. ( I couldn't find a substantial difference in the quality of music between wired and wireless though :) ) I absolutely loved this feature. ------5/5
-----------------------------------------------------------
Battery backup: I'm impressed with the battery backup of this beast. I've been using it for 3 days for 2-3 hrs a day still its running. So i guess the 8 hr backup per charge is not a marketing gimmick I presume it's true. So far so good. will update it after a month's usage.
------------------------------------------------------------
Dislikes:
1> Sound quality is more on the flatter side. When you compare it with budget wired headphones like Sennheiser CX 180 Street II bass is not too deep. You won't get that ambiance. Boat's website says:""Don't just be loud, be loud and clear"", Nope... sorry I've to disappoint you on this. When it's loud it's not at all clear. A lot of distortions are there when you are loud.
-----------------------------------------------------------
2> Comfort: Believe me, it's not at all comfortable for prolonged usage. Your ear will beg you to take it off after 30-45 mins.. If you have high fortitude you can push it till 1-1.20 hrs... If you could go more than that without taking it off for a minute then you are superhuman...
-----------------------------------------------------------
3> Range: Boats says 10 meters range... In my experience, if you go beyond 5-6 meters then the voice will break. You will never ever get 10 mtrs range trust me on that. And I'm experiencing occasional breaks in the streaming nothing intrusive so far but I don't know whether it will be a problem down the line. Will let you guys know about it later if it's a problem.
-------------------------------------------------------------
4>Flimsy aux cable: I can't complain too much about the aux cable keeping the price in mind. Remember I paid only 1299 for it. But with certain devices, the aux was not working properly. Mi note 3 had issues, Mi 4 also had issues with aux. Not sure whether it's the problem with my device. But it worked flawlessly on my laptop.
--------------------------------------------------------------
5> Wafer thin service centers: Boat gives 1 yr warranty but what good is it if you can't find any service centers near you. This is a hit or miss guys...
---------------------------------------------------------------
6> Voice cancellation: I didn't find this effective. Maybe it's just me, not sure.
----------------------------------------------------------------
7> Microphone is pretty much useless. You can't make calls with this headset.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Some alternatives:( These are all wired headphones, comparing them with a wireless may not be a good idea but still, I compare it with them because Boat rockerz comes with an aux cable, and if you are looking for an alternative irrespective of wired or wireless it might be of some use to you)
1>Sennheiser CX 180 Street II : I don't think Boat can beat this one's quality. The sound is incomparable- the base is deep, nice fidelity, nice ambiance and for a price of 799 this is unbeatable budget wired in-ear headphone. I own 2 of this beauty. Total value for money. If you are an audiophile and are on a tight budget then I can't a better alternative than this.
2> SoundMagic E10C In-Ear Headphones with Mic (Black/Gold): This is another TVFM earphone

3>Sony Extra Bass MDR-XB250 On-Ear Headphones
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Don't buy it:
1> If you are an audiophile ( obviously audiophiles will go only for wired headphones :D )
2> If you intend to use it for long hours.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Buy it:
1> If you are looking for a budget wireless headphone with decent built quality and performance.
2> If you require a wired and wireless package in one.
.-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Verdict: I'd give this headphone a score of 3.75/ 5
If you are on a budget and you want to enjoy a hassle-free Bluetooth headphone with good performance then CLOSE YOUR EYES AND BUY THIS BEAST trust me you won't regret it you won't be disappointed. In this price range, I couldn't find any other headphone with such a performance. We don't have many options.... Do we? :P :P

The actual price is Rs. 2999 and Amazon claim they are giving 57% discount. pls don't fall for that. I would not recommend paying more than 1700 rupees for this headphone.

3. Design: Remember I mentioned these headphones are good for movies and podcasts? Well, they aren't if you plan to listen to hour-long podcast episodes or watch complete movies at one go. These headphones are really tight on your ears. Even after a year of using them on a daily basis, they still feel tight. I wear spectacles so it's especially uncomfortable for me for long sessions. While it may be seen as a positive as it blocks the outside noise, I used them indoors so this didn't matter to me.

The padding on earcups and headband is good but the force exerted is still too much. I suspect the on-ear design is not only the culprit for making them uncomfortable but for its flawed sound.

The headphones are made of plastic and my pair works fine but there are plenty of videos on Youtube that show them breaking in the headband region at which point you have to throw them in the bin even if they work. The volume, power, call end buttons are located on the right earcup. I would have preferred if they were on both ears.

Verdict: These are not worth spending money. If you want headphones, I would strongly recommend you to buy Sennheiser headphones. They are more expensive but their sound and 2-year warranty makes up for the price difference. I have doubts any wireless headphones at this price point sound as good as wired Sennheiser headphones. If wireless connectivity is a must, then buy the Rockerz 225 available at the same price. They go inside your ear, create good isolation and sound much better. The only thing these are better at 225s is battery life and the option to connect them to your phone through a wire."
6455,5.0,This product is amazing.... I love it ..
6456,5.0,"I just love the quality & sound quality of the headphone. This was the first time I bought from the boat and I'm proud to say, I just love the brand so much that I can not think of any other brand when it's come to music tech."
6457,5.0,"As i expected from this product and it didnt let me down
little issue while connecting to pc and sometimes latency as well
allover great product
got it for 799"
6458,4.0,Nice
6459,4.0, Every thing is good . Worth buying.
6460,5.0,guys I have brought this boat headphones ...they were awesome .superb sound quality and..bass but they only thing was the cloth on the headphone making sweat and also they are small in size... so there ear pain what wearing for long hours....but this product was good one
6461,4.0,It has a nice finishing look and premium quality. Best thing is it’s lightweight and it has pretty good noise cancellation atleast for this range of price. Value for money i would say….
6462,5.0,"Being wireless headphones, I was bit unsure of the output, battery longivity and the strength of the product prior purchasing it. The following review is after 2 months of normal every day of usage of 1 and half hours during my commute.

Sound quality
-----------------

Positives
-----------

1. The output of music is fine and decent.
2. Syncs well with every genre quite well to give a balanced sound output.
3. The quality of the sound is deliverd as it should even at high volume level prohibiting any kind of distortion during playback.

Negatives
------------

1. When connected via Bluetooth, if you are using online music apps say gaana for streaming music and you want to toggle to a chat app say watsapp or the sms interface to write a message, a slight attenuation of sound is heard when the headphone is trying to switch from music playback to capture and play the keypress sounds through them.
2. At low volume, noise cancellation is not effective enough irrespective of the genre being played.

Battery life
--------------

Positives
-----------

1. As I have mentioned before, I use them almost 1 hour and 30 minutes in a day for 5 days a week which turns out to be 7 hours and 30 minutes as total usage once I charge them full. Although I charge them after the fifth day of use but then also the battery is not low which requires immediate attention and charge.
2. It is great battery performance for what the company claims and for being a budget Bluetooth headphone.
3. Even if some one who is a heavy user and find their headphone as their best companion for 8-9 hours a day, once charged full, it will keep you entertained for a good amount of time.
4. The headphone can be used wirelessly even if it is on charge (NOT ADVISABLE).

Negatives
------------

1. There is no way or an indicator to check the status of remaining charge of the battery and estimate the time to go zero.
2. I have observed the charging time from 0% to 100% takes almost 2 hours and some minutes. So, please make a note of it.

Material quality
-------------------

1. The design is simple and is sturdy.
2. The cushion at the over head band is ok and gives optimum comfort.
3. The height adjustable extenders seems to be metal which makes product feel strong and promising for a good amount of time.
4. I have read multiple reviews where they say the cushions on the driver is painful initially and persists if used for long period. As the drivers are of standard size and not too big, if not placed correctly on the ears, may create pain for few. As it is greatly adjustable, just make sure you are expanding the sides of the headphone fully and just gently keep them on the ears. Do not press them inwards with your hands much. Thus, you can get good comfort and enjoy your music.

My final verdict
-------------------

I am having no complaints about it's built quality, sound quality and battery performance. For a even better experience, I may upgrade to an expensive and high quality product some other time if I need to. But, I am convinced to a considerable extent with the headphones."
6463,5.0,Go for it using it for past 1 year good battery life
6464,4.0,"It is good for beginners
These were my first headphones and I'm satisfied with them plus the rate is applicable too.
Firstly it might hurt a little in ears as it is tight but slowly you'll be getting habit of it so have patience.
Sound, bass all are ok for me and i will recommend it to you also.
I got em for 899/-
(^_^)"
6465,5.0,This product battery and sound quality is very good
6466,5.0,Gr8
6467,3.0,"While connected to laptop changes quality of sound now and then
Dont know if only for 1 product"
6468,5.0,"The sound quality is as expected but in my case aux mode wasn't working so I ordered a replacement .
They took my headphones and it's been 10 days and I recieved my replacement with the same fault .

I'm gonna test with another aux cable . May be the cable is faulty .

But I will never order from Amazon again .
Such a worst replacement experience as compared to flipkart ."
6469,4.0,My opinion for this is very good 😃
6470,4.0,"Good backup , Good quality , noise cancellation is also good.
Best product with in this range.Must go for it."
6471,4.0,Good
6472,4.0,Happy!
6473,4.0,nice product
6474,4.0,Superb sound quality
6475,4.0,"1.It has very minimum speaker extending length around neck area which is very uncomfortable.

2. At this price range bass is not at all thumping. Its only good for hearing ghazal and not for party songs or bass song.....

3. I suggest if someone wants thumping bass please invest such amounts in earphone and not in headphone..... U will definitely get thumping bass.

4. No noise cancellation."
6476,4.0,"sound quality good
noise cancellation not quite good
bass nor high neither low
not for gaming
price too high for this product
bluetooth range good"
6477,4.0,Awesome product
6478,4.0,"i have used JBL bt500 for over a year and they are pretty good headphones for this price range.

PROS
Sound :- They have great sound and good clear crisp bass. Audio is clear while watching movies, video games and calls.

Build Quality :- They are really, really well build. i have accidentally drooped them a ton of times, they still are perfectly fine. Battery is still good and providing 15-16 hrs of use after an year.

Battery and Charging :- 16hrs of battery is very good even if you compare it to higher tier headphones but 2hrs of charging time on 2-2.4AMPS 5V makes it really shine. Also, they do provide an hour of use just on 5min charging.

Comfort :- They are comfortable. at least to me. Really nice cushions, even after a year of use there stitching hasn't loosen a bit. they are not the most comfortable as being on-ear headphones.

CONS :-
they don't have much cons compared to there range, but an aux port is still good because even with 16hrs of battery i have still gotten in cases where the battery drops at middle of meetings and movies. the thing that bugs me most is codec support. it only supports SBC and not the better codecs like APT and ACC which makes it not a good choice if you are a 'hardcore' gamer but for mobile and non-competitive gaming they are great, including the fact that they provide great audio.

also, if you are choosing between bt500 and bt450, go with bt500 it's additional battery do pays off.

Good Day."
6479,4.0,Build quality is very bad
6480,4.0,"this review is after usage of 1 year(to be precise) so i bought it when lockdown started for online class , music and other basic usage so it was godd till 6 moths then problems came in but till 6 moths it was good but after 6 moths first problem came in it was i connected it the voice was breaking and i could not hear the solltuion was disabel its handfree vareint in control panel 2. problem came in januvary 2021 it was the one
side problem i had to like punch the left side and then it would work it was good till here no more problems
but in feb the one side problem got more complex like i had to change the placement to a point in which i can hear and if i moved a littel bit it would not give sound i thought it will get god and it did improve the problem but now in april the charging issue i had to place it a certain point only then it will charge i thought ok bout after 10 days it was not turning on i pressed the power buttons many times but still not starting i searched how to fix this i did but only the white light came for like 2 seconds and went my final conclusion is not good for long period"
6481,4.0,"Product is good, but ears are paining."
6482,4.0,Worth the amount.
6483,3.0,No doubt the overall sound is bang. Bass is not tooo high but good. One con I found is that ears have to take a lot of pain even with the usage of 15-20mins as the set is too tight.
6484,4.0,headphones is perfect fine but built quality is not upto mark little disappointed
6485,4.0,Sound quality good bass is little low
6486,3.0,Original product..nreally good performance
6487,4.0,"It's lovely headphone, but it gets disconnected every few minutes during call. I would suggest go for higher alternative even I am looking to replace this one."

6489,4.0,"The Sound quality is good.
Bass did not meet expectations"
6490,4.0,"Good Quality and touch feels nice , however cushion quality seem to be cheap appears very fragile.

No Noise cancellation ,it catches lot of surround whe outside it's pretty difficult"
6491,4.0,"Even after charging fully, the battery drains out faster . Poor quality battery installed which anyone can discover only after using"
6492,3.0,"Hello JBL
Suddenly right audio stop working.very frustrating not expected from JBL brand. I hope you will resolve my issue."
6493,4.0,"While calling the sound gets distorted after a few minutes. It is very frustrating. Other than that, it's good for listening to music. The bluetooth connectivity range is good. Noise cancellation is not obviously not expected at this price. Only if the audio distortion while calling was not present it would have been a great deal."
6494,5.0,This can not be used with Microsoft teams in laptop. I get robotic sound when I join meeting. I have to disable mic in headphone and enable audio input from laptop. There is no point to use laptop mic when you have BT headset. I checked with Harman support and they said we can not make that high level drivers. Even Boat works fine which was s cheaper than JBL. Microsoft and JBL both could not fix this. If you just want to use this headset for music. It is perfect. Sound quality is great. Bass is perfect.
6495,4.0,"Everything about these headphones is great and true as advertised and shown. Sound quality is awesome, can get quite loud, deep and punchy bass and good highs and mediums too. Great battery life. lasts upto 4 days of average use. can watch upto 5 movies continuously on full charge. charge speeds are also nice. just half an hour charge and you are good for another 3 days. The only negative point about it is the long time comfort is not that good. Ears start to pain after 15 mins or so. They are slightly tight on my ears than i would like. After 20 days of usage, i have gotten used to it.If sound quality and battery life matters to you the most, these headphones are a no brainer. Just go for them. Fit is snug and they wont fall off from your head during running let alone walking."
6496,4.0,"Bass is not good and sound quality is pathetic
Never expected such a worse headphones from JBL
Seems to be made of cheap plastic and getting heat for 15mins of usage"
6497,4.0,They are decent quality headphones but the sound becomes quite garbled when the battery level falls below 40%. There is some issue with using it with Google Meet and the mic captures a lot of background noise. They are decent if you just want to listen to music or videos. Thought they were a bit too pricey!
6498,4.0,"Headphones work great, not recommended to wear them outside as you may not hear the traffic.

I do have some issues pairing them with my Macbook"
6499,4.0,It's a decent headphone . Overall value for money only battery backup is not good clamed 15 hrs but giving only 7 to 8 hrs that's why deducted 1 star
6500,5.0,"JBL Tune 500bt is a very good pair of headphones.
Noise cancellation is fair not at a pro level.
Bass is truly good, also the sound clarity is awesome..
However they are not comfortable for use more than 1 hour.."
6501,4.0,"It is truly a good product. Sound quality is just awesome 👌. After using one month, I can't find the cons in its sound quality. But there are cons out of that. The first con is the charging cable. Each time when I plug out of charge I have to give my full energy to remove it. The second con is after using for like one and half an hour it starts hurting. Except that it is just awesome."
6502,3.0,"One of the biggest problem i saw is when headset gets on, the mobiles ability to connect internet goes drastically down. internet disconnects frequently."

JBL has again proved that its a perfect product with its price. I think if anyone is looking for a headphone with mic for office/home & for calls, this is the perfect product. HD music played on this headset is just awesome. Off course high ended products not to be compared with this produce as the quality differs as per the price range. The only thing i wanted is to have in this is aux facility so that it could also be used as a wired headphone.

Good to buy product."
6506,5.0,Ok
6507,5.0,I liked headphone degined. Sound is also good and the bass of this headphone give a better sound quality. No problem in bulid quality it's made by plastic.
6508,4.0,"I’m pretty shocked by the sound quality these JBL headphones provide. They sound is clear and crisp, it goes pretty high and gives an amazing effect. The best part of these headphones is the bass and the battery life. They are surely made for bass heads, and the battery lasts for days for me with an average use of 3-4 hours daily. It does get a little uncomfortable on the ears after some time but for the price they are best you can get. Audio quality is better than AirPods."
6509,4.0,"1.The sound quality level is above than good at this price but it's not excellent so I gave 4 star to sound quality,
2.looks and design is also good enough.
3. Its overall weight is also quite good.
4. But its not that much comfortable to be worn on head for more than 45 minutes, after using it 40 to 45 minutes, I feel something painful and heavy on ears, head and neck. And for this I rate it 3 star for comfort.
Overall it's a good purchase, but the comfort level needs to be improved."
6510,5.0,"I had my doubts about these headphones but they came out to be just fine. Better than fine I should say. Build quality is fine,sound is great. It's a little uncomfortable if you wear it for too long though."
6511,4.0,"The headphones look good in white . Haven't lost colour or any other impairment since i bought (last year). They have great sound quality. If you are into ASMR these will make you feel all the tingles. Easy to operate.
The only glaring problem is when you are multi tasking. The headphones kinda lag in fps gaming sounds and also cannot stream from more than 1 source of audio. Ex- I cant listen to in-game music when i am on a discord call. Different tabs on chrome works fine. If you are gamer and looking to use this item for gaming and multi tasking, i'd go with another options since during that time the headphones are totally useless.
Solid item for audio quality though....!!!"
6512,5.0,Nice
6513,5.0,"Giving 1 star less as 4 stars for only for sound quality while using it for entertainment , however it is not good for taking and receiving calls"
6514,4.0,The sound quality is nice.this price range. Noise cancellation not best but normal. Bass quality is best .battery life around 2 day in single charge.
6515,5.0,Good for listening 🎧
6516,5.0,"If you are buying it for listening songs then plz don't buy it, What the hell, jbl say it's pure base, but that base makes your song kind of disturbing, every kind of base is changes to doom-doom... Not pure base."
6517,3.0,Sound quality is top notch. Much better than what you would usually get from more expensive models. I only use these for my gym workout so comfort level is excellent. Doesn't hurt the ear and very soft around the head. Good back up and charge speed is fast too. Over all I am very happy with my purchase.
6518,5.0,"Sound quality is just what you will like to have...Great clarity..Voice Calls also clear but not loud...

6565,4.0,"If you are buying it for listening songs then plz don't buy it, What the hell, jbl say it's pure base, but that base makes your song kind of disturbing, every kind of base is changes to doom-doom... Not pure base."
6566,3.0,Sound quality is top notch. Much better than what you would usually get from more expensive models. I only use these for my gym workout so comfort level is excellent. Doesn't hurt the ear and very soft around the head. Good back up and charge speed is fast too. Over all I am very happy with my purchase.
6567,3.0,"Sound quality is just what you will like to have...Great clarity..Voice Calls also clear but not loud...
The product is awsome but only the ear cups are a bit discomfort..had it been soft to ears and not very pressing...it would ve been the best of bests.."
6568,5.0,"Stay with my long review but I will tap on every point that will help you make a purchase decision if you are contemplating buying these.

The headphones -
The build is not exactly the build of an expensive set, although make no mistake, the materials used are top notch. The ear cups are soft and cozy, and they fit well on the ears. They completely envelope the ears and isolate more than 50% background noise with no music playing. The headband is soft foam on the bottom and well cushioned with a slight cutout in between to make it rest comfortably on the top of the head. The weight of the set might cause discomfort to some after extended wear. The build is all plastic with aluminium extender plates to extend the ear cups. Now as mentioned earlier, the build quality isn’t great; there is no mechanical swivel on the cups, yet they have a play which is unsettling to my mind. The play is in the hinge that holds the brackets of the cups. And they are creaky. I am not sure how long that is going to hold. It gives me the creeps to stretch the headphones holding the cups. I fear they might just break at the mount site. Otherwise, the extension of the cups holds well and tight and does not collapse inward.

Upon wearing -
The ear cushions are plush and feel expensive. The first thing you notice is they sit firm and tight. But the clamping force is extreme. It causes jawline pain in few minutes and although they aren’t uncomfortable to wear, the clamping force might be an issue for some because it causes a pressure effect up to the temporal bones. Removing them and doing some facial exercises does relieve the borderline pressure pain. More on that in an update after I use it for a few days.

Buttons-
A big thumbs up for the button placement. On the right ear cup you’ll find three buttons for play/pause, vol up and down and they are exceptionally well placed and ergonomically perfect. I take my palm up to the cup and my thumb by default finds the centre button without fetching for it. The buttons have a beautiful travel and have a satisfying click to them. The action is instant without any lag. A big plus IMO, since my Sennheiser headphones make me fetch for buttons every time even after a year of use.

Sound -
Day 1 : This is a first day review. Let me start with bass. With the slider at lowest level, the bass is good. Without engaging the bass slider, they are definitely tuned to pump more bass than any other headphone I have heard. The highs are good too. The vocals are clearly recessed right from the get go. This affects instrumentation too. Cymbals sound good. Engaging the bass slider does not cause too much of a difference in the initial 50% if you’re listening at a volume lower than 40-50% on your amp. I don’t know if it’s an issue with my unit, but sliding the slider in the initial 50% does nothing to pump bass if the volume is 50% or less. The bass kicks in and remains active only if the volume is 50% and more. If the volume is less than 50%, and I engage the bass slider to anything less than 50%, the bass does kick in, but after a pause or skip of track, where the music stops in between, the bass goes back to minimum. It does not retain it’s level. Be aware the bass is boomy and it likely boosts ranges 50Hz and above and doesn’t quite elevate levels lower than that. I am not a fan of booming bass at all and I was expecting sub-bass levels to be pumped, which, at least at day one use, doesn’t seem to be the case.

Update : Day 3: I can confirm that the bass slider does not engage below 50% of volume if the slider is also below 50%. Once the slider hits 50% mark, the bass suddenly kicks in. There isn’t a smooth transition in the bass as you would expect. If you want the slider to work smoothly, the volume has to be at the level of 60-70%, which for me is too loud. Some people might be comfortable with it. Now I don’t know how this behaviour will change with time, but I don’t think it will. I believe this goes down to the way the bass is created. They need some volume to start with the reverberation effect.

After nearly 12 hours of burn-in time, I can confirm the bass has improved significantly in quality. I will put it down to better excursion. The bass still continues to be boomy. But it reaches deeper levels now. It has become tighter compared to the first day of listening. It still isn’t hard hitting and anything above 50% on the slider causes the sound to become boomy and to overshadow other frequencies. Frankly, it is not about being a bass head or not, I myself crave for bass in music, but even for bass lovers, there should be something else listenable in the music other than relentless booming and reverberations, which isn’t the when case when the slider is anything beyond 60%.
So basically, with the volume under 60%, and the bass slider under 50%, the bass does not kick in, and with the slider above 60% all you can hear is booming and severely suppressed vocals and instrumentation. Although the higher frequencies (treble) still their own since those frequencies are also boosted at baseline.

To sum it up-
If you are a bass lover and don’t quite care about sound signature, these are a phenomenal set of headphones. If you find a sweet spot, the bass can be kept at enjoyable levels and the music and movies become quite immersive, but the slider is nothing more than a gimmick under 60-70% volume. The bass is quantitative not qualitative and is loose and sloppy, not tight and responsive. The highs are fairly well balanced with the bass, so if you like a V shaped curve on the EQ, you will be pleased with these headphones. They are made for a very niche category of people.

I hope you find this helpful."
6569,3.0,"Alright what I'm writing is an issue not just me but several people are facing after buying these headphones.The thing is that these headphones have very good sound quality and nice bass and all but one thing I want you all to keep in mind while buying these headphones is that the hinges are nice but they are fragile. If you are a person who uses headphones much then this is not for you. I bought these headphones is June 2021 but even before 1 year the hinges broke off and the bigger problem is that you cannot get it repaired cause skullcandy doesn't have any service centers in india, nor do they sell the hinges. A lot of people have to buy 3d printed hinges 3rd party hinges just cuz skullcandy has no solution for this problem. If you don't trust me you can search it on the web. Also I asked them if they could replace it cuz i hadn't even dropped it once.Most of the people here are writing reviews after just a few days so they'll obviously say that it is very good, the best and all that but as I'm writing this review after more than a year so i hope you understand that I've had this headphone long enough to understand a few things. SO THE CONCLUSION IS THAT IF YOU ARE GONNA USE HEADPHONES A LOT THEN THEN IT'S NOT FOR YOU BUT IF YOU LISTEN TO MUSIC OR DO GAMING ONCE IN A WHILE THEN IT MIGHT LAST LONG(ATLEAST LONGER THAN 1 YEAR)."
6570,5.0,"Anyone looking to buy some good headphones that could help in work from home as for that we need good mic, listening to every single type of genre of music, watching movies. These headphones can do it all, without even thinking twice just go for these. I have seen people saying these are very base yes they are because these are skullcandy crushers and beautiful thing is these headphones give you tue freedom to adjust the base according to your needs that’s lit. So if according to you base is more just reduce it but if you ask me it has overall very well balanced sound.

I have been using them for a week now the headphones is amazing have a skullcandy signature sound for which they are really famous. Every single acoustic can be clearly heard, if some is looking for ANC then these might not be suited for them as they offer good passive noise cancellation which I needed not the active one. Seeing the price they are being offered just go for them.

I literally enjoy work from home with these headphones and sideways when I want I can enjoy the premium music coming from these headphones. Only thing that I see to be noted is that these are l’ll heavy but by the time passes you will get used to it. Like for example I can wear them for straight more than 3 hours after that I would tke a little break put them off and then wear them again."
6571,5.0,"Unbeatable, Unbelievable, Incredible and Amazing Experience, When I use my Crusher at 80% I feels like sitting in front of my Logitech Z906 Home Theatre running at 60%, it's incredible, if you are looking to buy this
Plz Read my Detailed Review Below...

Sound Quality :- Quality is Good, Sound is clear but little bit heavy when bass level is above 50% Sound Quality can be improved, many other brands like Audio Technica, Sony and Philips, provide Very Good Sound Quality but their bass level is low.

BASS :- Wow it provide very good decent punchy bass, Bass Control is very helpful, It's complete package of Home Theatre Experience and Deep Bass Headphones,
At 10-30% it provides very good quality sound with perfect bass like Sony Extra Bass,
At 40-60% Feels like Amazing Deep Bass little bit Vibration make it more immersive experience, when watching Movies or Playing Pubg listing High Bass Music,
Above 80% Lots of Vibration, it's Amazing Experience yes it's more vibration then Bass, but still amazing experience it feels like sitting just in front of Home Theatre Subwoofer but we can't listen it for longer then 20-30mins but I love it, No other can compete with this.

Battery :- WOW battery backup is Insane no other brand can provide this type of battery backup with this amount of bass and good sound Quality, my phone battery can't run better than this, 36-38hr battery backup when playing music non-stop, wow and charging time is 1-1/2hr only, very very good battery backup and Bluetooth range.

Noise Isolation :- It's comes with Passive Noise Cancellation rather than Activate noise cancellation, but it's works, it provides very good noise cancellation when using this at 30-40% level it provide good noise cancellation, but at 70-80% wow u can't say train/bus/aeroplane running nearby it's really amazing, but yes any nearby person can listen what you are hearing, but as it passive noise cancellation it provides very good noise cancellatio, I give 4.5 out of 5

Comfort :- Leather, rubber etc lots an lots of good quality material used for making these headphones comfortable, it's looks very premium and it is very premium BUT it's little bit uncomfortable at earcup when I wear it for more than 3-4 hr, not very good for summer season but perfect for winter.

Detailed Rating :-
Sound Quality 4 out of 5
Bass Quality 4.9 out of 5
Battery backup 5 out of 5
Charging time 5 out of 5
Bluetooth range 4.6 out of 5
Comfort 4.6 out of 5
Wire Quality 4.7 out of 5

What in-box ?
AUX cable, microUSB Charging Cable, Manual, Warranty Card, Bill, How to Use Manual, Carrying Pouch, And Crusher headphone.

Then Should I buy this or not ?
If you are a bass lover, means Bass is everything then yes, I'm a bass lover, I love bass with good sound Quality that's why I bought this.
If you are a Youngster want to buy overhead headphones for style, buy any budget headphones.
If you are a average user, looking for decent sound Quality and deep bass/ punchy bass buy this or buy audio technica m series, or Sony/Philips overhead headphones.
If you are studio user who need flat sound and limited bass these are not studio headphones at all.
If you are a Music Lover, yes go for it, don't think twice if you are a bass lover, music lover, want to feel move theatre at home, want to feel the bass, or Hi-Fi User who want best headphones without compromising anything, buy this without double thought, YES it's Costly BUT it's Value for Money, 9K for Headphones is very High BUT it's one time investment, buy once forget for 8-10years.."
6572,5.0,"! I am not adding any pics becz you know how it looks !
I am writing here is the first in hand impression...
#No dought, It is a skull crusher... As a best example You can say that this as a walking home theater.
# ears get's tickled while hearing.. that much of bass. same like we sitting in a car fitted with aftermarket audio system.
#Bass is astonishing... With bass slider we can set what amount of bass we need... IT's really amazing
For those who is looking for bass headset go for this, please don't look for any other sets...

PROS
-since it's using extra driver for bass, the bass does not compromise the vocals.
-super comfortable on over head
-control buttons are so easy to handle
***IT's head rattling bass!!!!***

CONS
-only single device can be connected at a time... this one major flaw I got
(but remember, competitors of this pair such as sonyxb700 Bluetooth also have only one device connectivity)"
6573,4.0,"I bought this headphones only for bass nothing else. I have done my research and gone through as many reviews on internet possible. Many have said wrong things about it but majority accepts the Skullcandy Crusher's dominance in the bass department. So I made up mind and got this instead of Sony XB950 which was the only real challenger for Crusher in this price range. Honestly I don't know how the Sony sounds since I have never tried it. My expectations was quite high before I received my package. The crusher literally blew me out despite my unrealistic expectations. This much bass in a headphone really? that's unbelievable you gotta listen to it to believe it. My only worry about it before purchasing one was 'what if it is all vibrations or some fake bass?' but believe me and stop listening to critics saying so. It's not vibration it's real as hell. Yeah, think about you put your ears close to a large sub woofer all you hear is vibration and rumble right? Is that fake? No its natural, the deeper the bass is the more vibration is. That's exactly what you can hear with this headphone. Let me be honest I am not a fan of the overkill bass that some enjoy in their car. The wild and crazy vibration happens only if you turn the bass slider all the way up which is unbearable to listen to for long. I enjoy tight mid range bass more than vibrating bass. So I don't even have to move that bass slider at all. This already has more than enough bass without the slider. For some bass heavy songs with emphasis on very low deep bass I would slide it just a quarter max and that will give you that sub woofer effect more than you need. The problem with going crazy with the slider is that it takes away the mids and highs away and all you can hear is overpowering bass. Nonetheless the option is there for the user to decide how much bass they want. My only concern about this headphone is that it can't really perform well at lower volume. You have to start from at least 50% to get a decent loudness. Anything below 50% is too quiet. I don't know if it has something to do with my laptop's Bluetooth quality because I get little more loudness using it with my iPhone with the same volume level. I used to listen to music at 25% using my Sony XB450 which costs only 1800 Rupees (about 25 USD) which is pretty loud even at that level. I think this is probably a common problem among headphones with larger drivers as they need more output power to operate. But it's no big deal anyway. Your new normal listening volume level will be 50 instead of 30 if you have switched from a smaller headphone to something like the Crusher like myself. Once again don't expect too much clarity on mids and highs with this as this is purely a basshead headphone. Mids and highs are good but not great. I had a little trouble with Bluetooth connectivity too. I had to reset the headphone a couple of times to get it detected by my PC which is a bit worrisome but it's been only a few hours since I got my dream headphone. I am figuring it out. In conclusion this is probably the best bass headphone in the world for this price range. I would like to hear from people who got XB950s on how it sounds. I am proud that I have spent my money wisely and got something worth more than the money."
6574,5.0,"So I received this pair yesterday (26th March '21).
The product was broken from the hinge, had a torn ear cup and when I opened it, the box had a cheap cellotape to seal it and the headphone was kept out of the pouch (in all unboxing videos I have observed a brand new one usually comes kept in the pouch). So obviously I was provided with a used one. It would be unfair to give a one star rating to the headphones cuz of that!
I did return the headphones and received the refund and have ordered for Rs. 6499 from Skullcandy's official website (No sellers on Amazon had it under 7894 as on the purchase date)! But before that I did test the broken piece for its overall sound quality.

Coming to a genuine review:

1) Highs, Lows and Mids - Highs and Mids are decent. The vocals might be disappointing while pairing with a low range android device like nokia 5.1 plus (however, I have also paired with an iPhone XR and it sounds great). Also pluggin in the 3.5 mm jack gives the overall quality a drop.
The lows/bass are pretty good if bass slider is adjusted just at an optimal level (10-15% of the total slide path).

2) Build quality - looks sterdy as I have felt. However I would have to try it for a longer duration to fully test it out.

3) Comfort - I have used a lot of headphones in my life and hands down this is one of the most comfortable headphones for my ears. I don't have a huge pair of ears.
The comfort level is subjective however.

4) Value for money- Well, I got it for a steal deal from Skullcandy's official website for 6.5k (compared to Amazon's 7.8k) and truly is a bang for buck at that price point.

5) Call Quality- It's decent and does the job. Won't recommend this if calling is your main priority

Overall I would say it's a headphone for a casual user and one who doesn't mind experimenting with a funky bass. EDM and Hard rock lovers will adore this especially!

However, if you need to hear perfect vocals like as in classical music, I would recommend going for a Beyerdynamics or Audio Technica headphone (that too wired)."
6575,3.0,Good product
6576,3.0,It's a beast that needs to be handled smartly! At first I thought the bass is overpowering the music (may b coz I heard/read other people saying the same in der review) but later after using for a while I found that we need to set our equilizer accordingly. It's definitely delivers great performance when it comes to bass and overall music quality. I bought it for around 8k which I belive is a very good amount for such amazing headset! Thanks Skullcandy for such wonderful experience n thanks to Amazon for such amazing discount! You will surely discover the bass guitar in the songs that u already heard but the sound of bass guitar went unnoticed most of the time.. Recommended for bass lovers!
6577,5.0,"Hii..I am reviewing after 20 days. So if you want to buy a handphone for yourself u must keep some basic points in your mind other than sound quality like connectivity battery and comfortablity while using.so here is my review

1- sound quality- as is mention in name crusher it will literally crush your skull .base is awesome mean full base pr tum 10 minute se jyada use nhi kr paoge .ese purchase krne k bad aisa lgta h jaisa khud ka DJ H APNE PASS. Her ek vocals jis clearity k sath sunai denge na rha nhi jayega such mai

2- BATTERY — bhut hai 20 din mai 3 hi bar. Charge kiya hia bus (5/5)

3- CONNECTIVITY- Guys jaise earphones (one plus wireless z) ki hai usse kam h thodi 20ft k bad buffering start ho jati h yahi ek prblm lagi muje toh aur auto connectivity hoti toh batter tha
BASE ADJUST KRTE TYM BHI BUFFER MIL SKTA H KABHI KABHI

4- comfortable— built quality bhut lajawaab hone k bad bhi 10-15 minut k bad pain hota h between your ear and cheeks (mera head size bda h tooh sayad ye prblm muje ho rhi ho )"
6578,4.0,"It's all about the BASS! if you are a bass lover, these are built for you. Next level experience. Don't worry about the mids and higs.. They are crisp and clear aswell. If you turn the slider all the way up, then the bass won't be bearable and it feels like the sound quality has dropped. Build quality is also good. The best part of these is the battery.. It is Undrainable.Overall a great headphone with ultimate bass. I'm writing this review after about 1 month of usage.. it's totally worth it."
6579,3.0,"Finally got what I was finding for a few days. It's really awesome and perfectly designed for music. Bass is absolutely amazing. The connectivity is so fast. Loved it. And the battery backup, it too good. After a charge i used it for a week.
Totally satisfied."
6580,4.0,"Guys, I was also desperate and excited like you guys and reading reviews like you people at the time of purchase.

I read lots of reviews like headphone plastic quality is not good and there is no after sales service provided by them.

But, at that time I was pretty confident and skullcandy is the biggest brand. So, honestly I thought that what physical damage can happen to 10k product !!! Also I thought that I'm the only single user who will gonna use the headphones so, I will be careful as much as possible.

And then finally I ordered it  and after a very gentle use of 6 months it broke from the cheap plastic joint!!!
Trust me that it was the single handed used by me. And it's automatically broken like any cheap plastic which we generally see in the cheap toys. Plastic is too too cheap. You cannot expect this from the 10k product.

*Learned life long lesson from the after sales service*
I contacted the customer care of skullcandy which is 'brandeyes' for the India and all over the India there is one and only service center and it's located in the Noida-Uttar Pradesh. So be very very careful that if you are not living in the Noida then you are in a big trouble.

Because after contacting them on the customer care number nobody picked the call. I tried continuously for one 1 week on this number '0120-4341341'. (Small suggestion: If anybody planning to buy this product just try to call on this customer care number at least once. If they picked your call then you can happily buy it :).  

After that I mailed on their 'customercare@brandeyes.in' id. Again no reply got from them. Only they generate one ticket and told that they will reach out to me in two working days. But they will not. I escalate this issue even on other email given in their site. Still I didn't got any reply.

I again checked on the net that same issue has been faced by many many users of this crusher skullcandy product.
Even you can check this on the twitter and here also in Amazon reviews. See the similar story and pictures like me and read the reviews.
So, from those review I came to know that company is not accepting warranty claim for the physical damage like our case. So be very very careful. There will be no fault from the my side, it automatically broke due to cheap material still they will accept the warranty claim.

So, guys please always remember the thumb rule before purchasing any costly product which I learned from this incident:
1. Always check the after sales service.
2. Always check the Warranty conditions.
3. Always check whether Service center is located in your city or not.
4. Try their customer care numbers before purchasing whether they picking the call or not.

Because it's ultimately our hard earned money and if aftersales service is poor than you will only regret like me. "
6581,3.0,"As this headphones doesn't have Active Noise Cancellation (ANC), still it does cancel the noises outside when u start hearing your sounds

Good quality of material used looks premium

Even after 40 hours of battery use actually as per my usage it took after 2-3 weeks to charge my headphones, we can use the Aux cable provided by Skullcandy itself and continue using the headphones and for the info yes the bass slider works with Aux

And skullcandy gave a good pouch for the headphones which is really great and its a good quality too"
6582,5.0,"I read and read a lot about it before I brought one . Because I love bass and Bose QC has all what music has to offer, but for me it was life less without the heavy bass note ( owned nothing but Bose till date) . I needed bass to boost my spirits up. Hence opted this after my research on various head phones.

Truth : keep the bass at Max : u guys gonna hate it ! Noisy , no clarity with vocals , just flat vibrations on ur ears ( I ain't comparing the voice clarity with Bose or any other head phones , it's just generic ) . Overall u can't enjoy music .
My question is : why would some one wanna do that ? U just can't hear a thing !!!!!!

It's a nice thing that it's got a bass level adjuster .

Keep it on mid note or slightly lower (would recommend 40%)
You will love what an ear phone has to offer with respect to the bass front .
Would feel like u are taking a 2:1 woofer and walking along . ( Dont over expect the bass , but it's good ! (Not awesome or mind blowing)

I'm satisfied with the performance as at 40% the bass is lovely , strong enuf to pump me up and at the same time , the vocals and music of various diverse frequency is heard clearly !

I'm giving it a four star coz this sucks at high bass boost .
But at the same time , I ain't regretting for having brought it.

Go for it . Be polite with ur bass expectations , if so you will love it ! ;-)

Hope u guys found it helpful"
6583,4.0,"Okay. I was very excited when I purchased this. Read reviews and heard it's one of the best high bass headphones. N finally I purchased it.
1. Sound quality - quality is same as any good headphones which may be lower in rate.
2. Battery life - it's been what 20 days since I purchased it. N must be listening to it around 2 hrs average. I never charged it. Still using the backup it came up with. It's still showing half of juice left. INSANE.
3. Bass - I was very excited about this. But believe me its just a gimmick. You'll start getting uncomfortable after sometime. It's more of vibration than so called bass. It come up with haptic engine used by Apple as well. So it vibrates to give bass effect. Now I don't increase the bass at all. It's better that ways.
VERDICT - it's expensive, buy something around 5k and it'll serve the purpose. Battery is no doubt insane that the only thing keeping me from regretting the purchase. And bass is just a gimmick which can be avoided. So choose wisely!"
6584,5.0,"I mean for under 10,000. A perfect pair of headphones for your music, movie, games needs. I usually use them for listening to music while commuting or playing games in my free hour, And before this I owned a pair of AKG headphones. While playing the games especially when I shoot bullets or bombs in PUBG, or Battlefield you can feel the blasts around you there's no more shreiking noise that force you to put volume low instead there's a bham-bham bullet echo with brilliant bass.
For music I can tell, if you really wanna test. Listen to Get low ( DJ snake ). I mean you ok understand after that demonstration of bass power these little orbs posses.
Build is fantastic not cheap plastic but very premium plastic and well I don't like the word plastic anyway for headphones but I feel that the slider in the headphone just made me drool over the design. It's so smooth that you feel like real proud for owning them and can't wait for people to ask how are these. You just slid them your pair and let them judge for themselves. Only real bite to the eyes are the wires are outside but it can be overlooked coz after 40 Hrs of battery life I don't think you would bother looking at the wire. I mean you can't stand in front of mirror for 40hrs and try to judge them by the wires xD.

Noise cancellation. Ummm only passive no real dedicated deal to give you noise cancellation but if you ask me that bass won't let you hear the noise anyway. With all the bhooooom in your years. Nope very less chance for the noise to penetrate that.

Although there are few things that makes me come forward with it that is the sound leaks from the headphones quite more than slightly so if you planning to watch porn with the blasting volume I mind, you keep it low otherwise people around you might just feel free to the sound.

Oh yeah I returned my first batch coz of some problem in the slider but the next batch of headphones came from one month prior batch. And I felt there that there was more distortion in the first pair of headphones and in the next pair there was no distortion if I slide the bass all the way up. So mind your head."
6585,4.0,Sound and bass was good. Build quality is 9/10 but performance 😂 joke on the rocks 😂
6586,5.0,"Bought this as an entry level head phones based on a friend's recommendation. Very good value for money. Looks and feels like a premium piece. I use it extensively and even or regular calls . You will not go back to using a mobile , directly. The sound quality is exceptional and just right for me. I don't use the bass too much , its fun for a while and at low levels only. The Bluetooth connectivity is spot on. Paired it with one phone only. A few times , it fails to connect automatically. But , other than that, hardly any issues

Two negatives. One is the UX cable With Microphone & Remote which they provide. Not top quality and it has started to give me audio issues . I connect these to my office laptop for calls. And now can't do that anymore. The second issue is the quality of the ear pads. 8 months of extensive usage and the ear pads are wearing off at the sides and even a bit inside. Currently searching for earpads to replace . W"
6587,4.0,"[UPDATE]

I used this headphone for 1 year now and here are the cons:

1. Only 1 Bluetooth device will be connected at a time, suppose you are to shift to PC after using it on your mobile you will have to reset the headphone so that it will connect to your PC

2. The hinge is quite delicate and it broke off within 2 months. I had to go for customer support and sadly it took me almost 7 months to get my product replaced(I was told it will be repaired but due to their lack of professionalism they decided to send a new pair of headphones which was good in my personal opinion but surely it won't happen to everyone so be careful. Customer Service in India sucks badly for SkullCandy)

I had a budget of 5000/- for headphones but I extended it to 8000/- just because of these headphones.

Things I have noticed so far:

1. Bass booster as many said is just a vibration, I'd say it's not true. It feels like vibrating due to high bass on such a small device. Don't believe them and it's nothing like uncomfortable to your ears.

2. I don't feel any weight on my head, obviously, it's a huge pair of headphones but the comfortable cushions makes it possible to wear them for 2+ hours straight.

3. Bluetooth connectivity and AUX connectivity, no difference between them. The audio quality is noticeably same

4. Battery life is beyond expectations. I bought these headphones at 32% charge and I watched two movies on it as of now. And the battery is 30%. I'm surprised

5. I chose the white color over black. And just to confirm it's actually cream not white. So think before buying it. The pics are totally different from the actual device

6. Buttons are solid and the size-shifting mechanism is strong. Not like people mentioned that it got broke easily. Nothing like that. You can use it comfortably. It's durable"
6588,5.0,"As you can see from the reviews the hinge is easily damaged and they don't cover it in warranty, bad build quality and awful service from their customer care. Bad investment."
6589,4.0,Unable to connect Bluetooth.
6590,3.0,"One of the best sounding resonable priced headphone I owned, but the cheap plastic build ruined the experience. Yep it is broken from the folding hinge.. 1 year of usage came out of it.."
6591,3.0,"Crusher is a very appropriate name provided to the product as it crushes your dream of owning a costly pair of headphones, expecting it to be high quality product. Product no doubt has a great sound, but what is the use if the plastic housing the entire circuit and machinery is made from poor quality plastic.

Guess what?? I had contacted the replacement department of the Indian skull candy dealer(brand eyes) and they further CRUSHED my hopes of ever using these headphones. Even though they are in warranty period, they refuse to replace it due to external damage due to the following reasons

1)Warranty shall be void if the product has been opened, attended at any unauthorized service center or third party.
2)Faults of which the purchaser was already aware of at the time of purchase.
3)Damage by any violent head-banging session (wearing the headphone improper way).
4)Faults due to accident, lightening, misuse and ingress of water/moisture.
5)Faults due to wear and tear and force majeure.
6)Faults due to exposure to caustic substances, fire, improper ventilation, dropping, mishandling or excessive shock or any external cause beyond Skullcandy’s control and/or any damage caused due to tampering of the product by an unauthorized agent.
7)Warranty shall not cover any damages resulting from un-authorized adaptations, improper or reckless use, damage on account of high ampere charging, defined as charging ampere > 1.1A or unattended long duration of charge exceeding 30 mins.

My damage didn't fall in any of the policies stated above but still the customer care would respond with automated replies and wouldn't tend to issues of replacing a small part. I am just asking to replace the hinge , but they wouldn't listen at all .

If you purchase these and when you want to use them, you would want to take them and unfold them , but listen if you unfold them slowly and carefully and what if the hinge breaks?!! it is better to use them as speakers! but be careful don't touch them! the headphone might still break. It should be renamed as Skullcandy Delicate® Series or Dream® Crusher"
6592,3.0,"If you're considering to buy any product from Skullcandy, you like bass and warm tones of music, you're not a hard core audiophile but you love a product that stands justified for its cost. You want an unapologetic, power-packed, behemoth of a product that satisfies your urges of a great listening without creating a hole in your pocket( cases in point- Beats, Sennheiser, Bang and Olufsen etc.). You're paying 9500 bucks for this product and that is still a lot of money but the product is worthy of the amount paid.
Unlike its predecessor, the product quality is better. The crusher line of headphones are known for the vibration that comes along with the bass but Crusher wireless sounds better than the others without the haptics turned on. Sometimes, you can hear the spring when you gently tap the headphones, which is a little annoying. When you turn on the haptics the middle notes get a little muddy, it might also be because of the vibration but it's there. If you're not an audiophile, you'll find these amazing. It's less bulkier than the Wired crushers. In summary, a high end product of low end brand is always better than a low end product of a high end brand.

PROS
Mind blowing bass
40 hours of battery and more, if you do not use the haptics quite as much.
Connectivity is amazing,
Great for long hours listening.
Adequate for watching movies and playing games.
There is option for multiple pairing as well.(You can pair multiple devices at once)
Better Design with plush materials
Comes with a 3.5 mm jack for an option of wired listening.

CONS
You can hear the haptic spring sometimes.
Muddy middle notes with haptics turned on."
6593,3.0,"Here’s my detailed review of skullcandy crushers wirless after using sony mdr650 for 2 yrs and sony mdr950 for almost 1 year. My detailed review will mostly be in comparison to it’s rival sony mdr950.

I used sony mdr650 for almost 2 years and they never disappointed me. Almost 2 years after, they broke from hinges but still work and I love the crisp clear audio from them. After those, I was hooked to sony so decided to upgrade to it’s big bro mdr950. The 950 had a bass boost button which was cherry on the cake. The clarity of acoustic/treble is simply unmatched in sony.

Today, I got skullcandy crushers. They looked beautiful and I had alreay heard a lot about their bass feature. After wearing it for the first time, I noticed that I could hear spring noises as soon as I pat on them. Even a gently tap on them would yeild an annoying noise.

Coming to the output- the acoustics and treble is not upto sony mdr950. The sony did a great job here.
Boost slider in crushers was something which sounded like artificially boosted after 30%. The feature looks quite appealing at the time of purchase but trust me you won’t even use it after some time.

Build quality of crushers looks a little better than sony.

Crushers are more comfortable than sony.

Crushers has a lot better battery life but sony also doesn’t run out of juice easily.

Crushers has a plus point of bass slider working in aux mode as well. Sony’s bass button doesn’t work in aux.

Overall if you ask me, I will recommend sony mdr950 over crusher wireless because it has perfectly balanced audio which sounds much natural than crushers."
6594,3.0,Good
6595,4.0,"Overall a good product, writing review after one year of use, bass is amazing, for movie watchin and general music listening, cushion did come off a bit. Bass control slider is magic"
6596,1.0,"For those who want an unbiased review, read along.

Pros:
1. Extremely awesome Bass - Forget about the bass slider, the bass is just purely awesome when the slider is completely lowered. It's epic when you boost the slider up.
2. Doesn't feel heavy despite the headphone weight.
3. This has a spectacular battery backup, just one charge will go almost a week. I always use this, and it did.
4. Value for Money - You won't find a match for this at this price range.
5. You'll love it when you watch action movies, you can have the theatrical effect.
6. The ear cups are so comfortable, you'll just love it. Trust me!

Cons:
1. It's made of plastic around the hinges, so doesn't feel that premium.
2. When you increase the bass slider, you'll lose treble and might barely pick up the sounds in that frequency. To adjust that you need to increase the volume.
3. Bass slider doesn't feel premium either. It's just all wobbly.
4. Headphones has to be used delicately, just in case you don't break the hinges.
5. The buttons for power and volume feels cheap, but that wouldn't affect your music experience though.
6. You need to extremely careful about the popping out wires, just in case they don't get stuck somewhere and you tearing it out pulling the headphones without even realizing it.

Verdict: Well, it's all about the experience which outweighs all the cons here. You'll just have to extra careful, but other than that this is so worthy for the price. You wouldn't find a match for this in this price range. If have set your mind to purchase this, don't take second opinion and BUY THIS HEADPHONE. :)

GOOD DAY!"
6597,4.0,"I am writing this review after 2 months of usage and experience......

First I will say the pros...

1. Amazing sound quality
2. Mind blowing battery life
3. The bass and bass control feature
4. Portability
5. Hassle free connectivity
6. Premium look
7. Soft ear cushion
8. Charging indicator ( Red & Green )
9. Even though it doesn’t have noise canceling feature it does blocks some sound

Now I will talk about the cons....

1. While using for the first time, it feels uncomfortable , but I guarantee you once you get used to it like 3,4 weeks you will surely love it
2. If you are using this head phone while walking(hard) , you can hear some spring noise sort of thing ( when the music is at very low volume or when the headphone is off)

3. Sometimes when you watch movies over the Bluetooth and when the bass ( very low ) kicks in some sort of distortion is heard , but when switched to aux the audio is much better

Now I will talk why I chose skull candy over Sony XB-950BT

1. Sony has very flimsy body

2. Doesn’t have bass control feature,
Believe me you will never have to use 100% bass in these headphones, so skullcandy has the functionality right at your fingertip while the Sony is through the app 😖

3. Batter life
With one charge it would probably go for 3,4 weeks of normal ( 50% base , Bluetooth, medium volume ) use
In 2 months I’ve only charges it 4 times....we can still enjoy music even when the headset is dead and too having the bass control feature

Final thoughts....

I would really really recommend this headset for bass lovers and those whose are addicted to music especially EDM.....
Once you get used with this headphone you will never feel like you wasted your money

REAL VALUE FOR MONEY PRODUCT 💯"
6598,4.0,"Hello Guys,
I don't usually write reviews for products, however, I fell like writing for this one considering the fact that most of people are confused between Sony xb950b1 and Skullcandy crusher.

Let me tell you my story- I bought these headphones after researching a lot. I read a lot of reviews and watched many videos.
There were positives and negatives for both the headphones. Some were claiming that sound on Skullcandy crusher isn't great while some were saying it was slightly better than Sony. Others were saying Sony sounds better. Nevertheless, Sony xb950b1 has another problem that put people off form buying them i. e. build quality. A lot of people complain abouts these breaking easily and I found many reviews on the same on Amazon.com.
So, finally, though Sony seems to be a better choice, I bought Skullcandy crusher just because I didn't want to my headphones to break within a month.
I received the Crushers and didn't waste time to paired them with my OP6... And and within 15 min I put them back into box!! They sound so ARTIFICIAL!! Their BASS is fake. It hurts your ears after a while. You don't feel the natural bass.. It is just isn't natural!! I was so upset.

Next day I went to a local market to tried Sony Xb950b1 and man this is how a headphone should sound... Amazing natural bass which makes you happy :) You feel like dancing.

I bought Sony Xb950b1 instantly :)

Enjoy the music... And Yes Sony is Sony when comes to music quality."
6599,4.0,Didn't get the pouch with the product. Was missing the pouch.
6600,4.0,"These headphones are good best in segment.
Only there is one cons you can't wear them for long duration. Your ears will start to pain if you are not use to headphones then be ready for some pain and great sound"
6601,4.0,"Amazing sound quality. This is not a ‘noise cancellation’ head-set, but it cancels a lot of ambient noise and only thing going through your ears is the sound form your headphones.
The haptic bass is too good. You can feel the Vibrations. Keeping the slider on ‘high’ might hamper the vocals and the lows. But again, it can be adjusted to ones preference.
The ear-muffs are soft and hugs your ears nicely. Just wished they'd turn 90 degrees, too. Coz, if you have to put it around your neck, you have to sit upright.
The volume and on/off buttons are nice n big. But it starts getting some sort of border around it. My be dust or finger marks. Also, the inside of the 'haptic bass' slider could have had a mat finish. Being glossy, it gets scratched easily and is visible.

The battery back-up is amazing. It goes on for days if you are using it for few hours everyday. Also, there is a 3.1mm jack, incase the battery dries up

Problem arises when you connect the crushers to a device, (your Mac or your android device) the bluetooth on your iPhone starts (as I have paired it) and it starts conflicting with the crushers, hence connectivity gets affected. The concept of connecting to ‘many devices’ becomes an issue. Now I have to go to my iPhone settings and turn-off the bluetooth as turning it off from the control centre dsnt help, because IOS connects automatically when it detects any near-by bluetooth device.

Also, my device didn't have a laminated cover over the box. I just hope they are genuine and the service guys won't create a fuzz if, someday, I have to take them to the service centre."
6602,4.0,Call quality should be improved
6603,4.0,"Its not for studio audio pro users. Its only for everyone who like bass. Sound is very good. Battery life is the best that you can get on any bluetooth headset right now. When it turns on and off you can see a purple light indicator. And if you put them on you can hear it say that its on.
To connect with a device you have to press and hold the power key for 3 seconds then it will show the bt headset on your device.
When its searching for bt device it blinks red and blue light indicator.
When its charging red light indicates charging and after 2 and a half hour it will fully charge and green light will indicate that its fully charged.

If you compare with other brands within this price range none can compete with it. I have used Sony / BoAt / Jbl etc but this is something.

IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR GAMING USE I WILL SUGGEST THAT USE IT WITH WIRES. THERE IS A 3.5 MM JACK WITH A BUILT IN MIC IN THE BOX. USE IT FOR BETTER GAMING EXPERIANCE.

Pros : *Good sound quality.
*best battery life.
*bass you really feel with adjustable bass slider.
* premium quality.
* will not fall from your head

Cons: when you use it for the first time it will clam your head hard. After 1 or 2 days of usage it becomes normal.
The haptic engine that provides the head shaking bass comes fraction of a second late.

*** if you are looking for a headphone for listening music and enjoy like its party everytime. Buy it now. Its for fun listening and enjoying life.***

# the plastic joints broke after 6 months.. So be careful...!!!"
6604,4.0,"Audiophiles and those looking for a relatively accurate sound will want to keep looking, but those into boosted bass may appreciate what these headphones have to offer. That’s because these headphones can seriously pump out the bass — to unsafe levels if you so choose.

Skullcandy Crusher Wireless Ports

With the bass boost switch turned all the way down, the bass is actually relatively well-tuned. It’s strong and powerful, to be sure, but it won’t blow your brains out. Turn that bass boost switch up, and all that changes — to the point that the headphones actually vibrate with the bass and it feels like a subwoofer has been implanted into your brain. Ridiculous? Absolutely, but the good thing here is that the listener has control. The headphones also seem to be built to resonate at a certain frequency, which further helps make that bass sound even stronger than it is. That makes these headphones perfect for the mega-bass fans out there, and even they might need to keep the bass boost at relatively low levels.

The mid-range is decently well-tuned, with a warm and present low-mids, and a high-mids that seems to dip slightly. The high-end is also slightly dipped — but that’s not all that unexpected from a pair of headphones aimed at being so bass-heavy. That’s not to say that the high frequencies aren’t there either — they are. It’s just that they could be boosted a little.

The headphones offer decent stereo separation, and don’t seem to technically distort very easily — which is a good thing."
6605,5.0,"First time buyer, was not very sure of the quality as most of the reviews online give negative reviews, bought it anyway, I just don’t see what the fuss is about, I have owned headphones from other manufacturers and at this price Skullcandy crusher is a great pair of headphones for the price (provided you are a bass head). The bass is just mind blowing, I know it is haptic driven but who cares. If you looking for a more balanced sound then I don’t recommend these. The quality is acceptable, the finish however is amazing. If the midrange was slightly better then these would be mind blowing. Comfortable to wear, extremely good battery life. Overall the best thump for your buck"
6606,4.0,"Superb battery performance, mind-blowing bass, bluetooth connectivity is good. If. You are looking for long Lasting headphones go for it... This have a bass controller which feels like a subwoofer and watching movies will give you home theatre experience. I have purchased 6 months ago and enjoying. I keep this with my travelling it's comes with a pouch which is quite fine... And also with one aux cable in case of battery go down you can connect and play. But once you charge it really lasts for 3-4 days depends upon your usage. Good product. Just one point to know this is a foldable headphones so you need to little patient while opening and closing it."
6607,4.0,Product was received in a old box. Edges of box had small paper tearings. Due to weight we can feel pain on head after 10-15mins. At full bass we feel like a woofer playing in our ears.

VERDICT: Please dont invest 8-9k on this device as thwey will only last for about 8-12 months normal usage. You can go ahead and say that you will keep them in a sophisticated manner and what not but believe me because I thought the same myself.

Hello friends. My father is a basshead and he loves music. I have admired skullcandy crushers from the time when i first laid them on my ears. I borrowed them from a college friend at that time and made my life's goal to purchase them online and I did it by the end of 2018.

I gifted this headphone to my father and he enjoyed this headphone in the beginning. He used regularly for the first month and then weekly once and then monthly once because of his busy schedule.
After nearly one year of minimal usage, cracks started appearing near one of the folding hinge of the headphone. The Cushion's material started peeling off and the material underneath looked gross, destroying the vibe. I used steelgrip tape to cover the cracks and applied feviquick before!! Yes desi jugaad. Because, mind you, any physical damage is not covered in warranty and you are advised against wasting your time in contacting customer care which turned out with no results for me. So after that, the headphones plastic materials broke from the nearby 3 places near the hinge in the form of small fragments which i promise you cannot be fixed by feviquick or tapes and thats how the headphones look now in the images😞😞. Such a good quality headphone is a bummer all due to its poor build quality. So disappointing."
6609,3.0,"If you like bass more than anything else then this one is absolutely for you. It has so much bass with haptic engine that causes vibration that you will start to wonder if you really liked that heavy bass; complete justice to the name... it crushes your head with bass.
Probably not for an audiophile as its not a very clear mids and highs aren't too natural, however this headphone had the power to make you stay loving bassy songs.
The best part of this headphone is that you can drag the slider to choose pe jese amount of bass you love and that makes this headphone a perfect choice for bass lover.
I am using for over a month and battery performance is phenomenal, absolutely no competition there, fast charge is a bonus as you hardly may need it.
My recommendation, if you are inclined towards bass, just go for it without a second thought."
6610,4.0,"Simply awesome..I am a music lover..bought it in Januray 2018 at rs 9300..The Battery back up is just wow..charge it once in a month for 4 - 5 hours( yes i mean it ) and it will last till a month with even good amt of use..Sound quality is too good..the bass controller button makes it unique...and believe me this bass controller button is of too much use..you will need to change the bass level according to different songs, which is missing in sony.. yes its a little hard or tight whtevr to hold it on your head for a very long time initially you will feel( in this area sony is better) but later i got used to it..it is not a big problem...but it covers the ear fully and gives ur ears warm feeling..,no problem at all in that...Before buying it , i was very much confused between this and sony 950bt ( Allmost same price ) ..but finally bought this one..and honestly spkng, i am not regretting...U can go without any doubt with this one., specifically considering the Extra plus point in this with battery backup and bass controller buttons.."
6611,3.0,"These are well built, I have kicked them off of my bed (accidentally) and not a single scratch, also the sound quality is good , you need a good Equalizer application on your device for good quality don't blame it on the hardware it's not headphone's issue when you can tweak it to your preference, bass is Monster and comfortable around head and ears , extend the size for better comfort, they're light weight not heavy or bulky on head, people complained a lot about its bad quality but honestly there's nothing as such they're built to last easily the best in this price segment! Buttons are tactile and not at all mushy to use."
6612,4.0,"the first thing is if u r going or thinking of buying it , u should bcoz writing a review give false assumptions to people
u should feel it urself there are many other brands i dont want to force u to believe thats its a good choice
COMING TO THE PRODUCT:
1. its BASS SLIDER is the real DEAL (For BAss LOvers its definitely for u)
2. its battery is amazing
3. good passive noise cancellation But dont expect it to be the level of ANC coz it does not have it
4. Incredible sound quality.
CONS
1. The Bluetooth disconnects if u live inn a thick or heavy type of home in the sense(""yeah i know"" heavy thing)
it must be in a straight line path for its 10m range cant be obviously i think thats not a problem but if u really want
do ur home chores wearing it not for u , but if u a student or something like that u should go for it"
6613,4.0,"So I'm a bass lover and I just bought this headphone for the bass and this headphone is great for the bass.

But, there are some small issue like if you try to hear songs in full bass then it will just vibrate your ears. I mean there are a lot if vibrations. You can really feel the bass.

Sound quality is good but not best because you will not able to hear crystal clear sounds.

This headphone is great if you're watching MOVIE. GOD it is just amazing. It will be like you're watching movie in a theater and you will able to feel everything.

So this headphone is great according to its price."
6614,4.0,"Excellent headphones below 10k.

***Build Quality***
4/5
Everyone complaints about the hidges is breaking.
If your headphone is a multiuser or you roughly using then i think this might break.
So i recommend this if you alone using this.Also if you are a rough user then this might happen.

So just treat this as a product worth 10k then no issues :)

***Sound quality***
5/5
Hats off on that.

Definity this one is a way better than SONY MDR-XB950B1. I have used latter also.
Sony more costly. You are paying for brand value more than sound quality.
Mids, Highs, low everything is better in crushers. The bass slider is excellent that you can adjust bass.
You can feel real physical bass in this, on sony its just overpowered bass
Just don't belive the reviews of sony MDR-XB950B1 on the product page. People believe the brand value which give them satisfaction.
See some review sites like rtings.com and youtube comparison videos, crushers is always best.
***Comfort***

After watching a 2.5 hour movie, i felt no pain on my ears.

***Battery life***

Simply the best in segment. 40+ hrs"
6615,4.0,"Statuary warning - These headphones have some serious bass and can shake your brain as well as your skull.
Design - They come I an industrial packaging , a hard cardboard box , carrying case and some accessories. You guys will fall in love be with these headphones when you will tale them in your hands.
They fit like they are custom made for your ears.
Now comes the most important point for which you folks have been waiting so eagerly - sound quality
The headphones have 2 dedicated drivers in each cup , a 40mm driver for vocals and it also gives some decent amount of bass and a secondary driver 34mm driver purely for BASS . And the magic starts when you slide that slider up. Guys believe me that the bass will knock your socks off and some of you may also get goose bumps . The bass is not like a conventional 2-3k headphones or earphones , as the box says ""bass you can feel"" you will literally fell the bass it will shake your skull (physcall) . The bass is like the bass from a 20 inch subwoofer. The bass is leathal at 20 % of the slider up but beyond that point it will leave your jaws dropped.
They plus point is that that vocals dosent gets distorted even when the bass is very high and you can even enjoy the bass at low volume just slide that slider up and you will have some skull crushing bass.
Final words : if you are a bass head ,just close your eyes and spend 12 k on these you will never regret you have my word for that.
Now , for my pot smoker's , guys buy them without any doubt I just can't explain that bass experience when I am high ....its just breathe taking.❤"
6616,3.0,"Everything about this headphones is average if not bad.
Audio quality is decent when the haptic slider is kept at lowest settings. Increasing that slider degrades over all audio quality and gives a fake bass. It's fun at times but doesn't always gives good audio feel.

I knew all of the above before purchasing it. So no complaints at all.
BUT, the build quality is so cheap that I'm handling this thing like a new born child. I'm too worried if I drop it accidentally, that's the end of it. Even while wearing and removing the headphones I feel like it's gonna break if I tilt a bit more. Seriously guys build quality is that cheap and for the same reason this headphones should not be priced above INR 5000.

Battery backup is great. I could use it for 4 days without charging.

Bluetooth range is too short. Disconnects instantly if I move to the next room. I had a mi superbass headphones which had no issues with connectivity with 2 walls in between(I had to sell that one because everything else about that was bad)"
6617,3.0,"Like any confused buyer I researched on every medium I could lay my hands onto be it Youtube, review sites and specially Amazon reviews. Finally I zeroed on these beasts but I still had my doubts even after laying my hands on these.
Is the bass to high?
Do i really need a bass slider?
Should have I gone for Sony 950?
Luckily while on a trip I was able to lay my hands on few wireless headphones at a duty free and believe me that was the day I laid rest to my doubts once and for all.
These beasts knocked the likes of Sonys , Sennheisers and entry to mid level Beats out of the park. The feel, the comfort, the sound quality , the BASS were in no comparison to the Crusher. Even the battery life was the best among any other brand. Others felt like bland grandpa’s headphone in front of these.
Also regarding doubts of usefulness of the slider as sometimes stated otherwise by other here, I have to say that slider is the best and the most useful feature and its is actually quite important for bass heavy headphones like these. I use slider a lot, be it while watching a movie or while listening to slow and acoustic music.
Finnaly, my view regarding artificial vibrations for bass are that, these are bass heavy headphone and their purpose is to provide the wholesome experience of how bass works and the vibration enhances the experience exponentially atleast for me.
So therefore for confused bass head buyers like me I recommend that you can go for these beasts without any speck of doubt whatsoever and prepare for your brains to be CRUSHED."
6618,5.0,"Stay with my long review but I will tap on every point that will help you make a purchase decision if you are contemplating buying these.

The headphones -
The build is not exactly the build of an expensive set, although make no mistake, the materials used are top notch. The ear cups are soft and cozy, and they fit well on the ears. They completely envelope the ears and isolate more than 50% background noise with no music playing. The headband is soft foam on the bottom and well cushioned with a slight cutout in between to make it rest comfortably on the top of the head. The weight of the set might cause discomfort to some after extended wear. The build is all plastic with aluminium extender plates to extend the ear cups. Now as mentioned earlier, the build quality isn’t great; there is no mechanical swivel on the cups, yet they have a play which is unsettling to my mind. The play is in the hinge that holds the brackets of the cups. And they are creaky. I am not sure how long that is going to hold. It gives me the creeps to stretch the headphones holding the cups. I fear they might just break at the mount site. Otherwise, the extension of the cups holds well and tight and does not collapse inward.

Upon wearing -
The ear cushions are plush and feel expensive. The first thing you notice is they sit firm and tight. But the clamping force is extreme. It causes jawline pain in few minutes and although they aren’t uncomfortable to wear, the clamping force might be an issue for some because it causes a pressure effect up to the temporal bones. Removing them and doing some facial exercises does relieve the borderline pressure pain. More on that in an update after I use it for a few days.

Buttons-
A big thumbs up for the button placement. On the right ear cup you’ll find three buttons for play/pause, vol up and down and they are exceptionally well placed and ergonomically perfect. I take my palm up to the cup and my thumb by default finds the centre button without fetching for it. The buttons have a beautiful travel and have a satisfying click to them. The action is instant without any lag. A big plus IMO, since my Sennheiser headphones make me fetch for buttons every time even after a year of use.

Sound -
Day 1 : This is a first day review. Let me start with bass. With the slider at lowest level, the bass is good. Without engaging the bass slider, they are definitely tuned to pump more bass than any other headphone I have heard. The highs are good too. The vocals are clearly recessed right from the get go. This affects instrumentation too. Cymbals sound good. Engaging the bass slider does not cause too much of a difference in the initial 50% if you’re listening at a volume lower than 40-50% on your amp. I don’t know if it’s an issue with my unit, but sliding the slider in the initial 50% does nothing to pump bass if the volume is 50% or less. The bass kicks in and remains active only if the volume is 50% and more. If the volume is less than 50%, and I engage the bass slider to anything less than 50%, the bass does kick in, but after a pause or skip of track, where the music stops in between, the bass goes back to minimum. It does not retain it’s level. Be aware the bass is boomy and it likely boosts ranges 50Hz and above and doesn’t quite elevate levels lower than that. I am not a fan of booming bass at all and I was expecting sub-bass levels to be pumped, which, at least at day one use, doesn’t seem to be the case.

Update : Day 3: I can confirm that the bass slider does not engage below 50% of volume if the slider is also below 50%. Once the slider hits 50% mark, the bass suddenly kicks in. There isn’t a smooth transition in the bass as you would expect. If you want the slider to work smoothly, the volume has to be at the level of 60-70%, which for me is too loud. Some people might be comfortable with it. Now I don’t know how this behaviour will change with time, but I don’t think it will. I believe this goes down to the way the bass is created. They need some volume to start with the reverberation effect.

After nearly 12 hours of burn-in time, I can confirm the bass has improved significantly in quality. I will put it down to better excursion. The bass still continues to be boomy. But it reaches deeper levels now. It has become tighter compared to the first day of listening. It still isn’t hard hitting and anything above 50% on the slider causes the sound to become boomy and to overshadow other frequencies. Frankly, it is not about being a bass head or not, I myself crave for bass in music, but even for bass lovers, there should be something else listenable in the music other than relentless booming and reverberations, which isn’t the when case when the slider is anything beyond 60%.
So basically, with the volume under 60%, and the bass slider under 50%, the bass does not kick in, and with the slider above 60% all you can hear is booming and severely suppressed vocals and instrumentation. Although the higher frequencies (treble) still their own since those frequencies are also boosted at baseline.

To sum it up-
If you are a bass lover and don’t quite care about sound signature, these are a phenomenal set of headphones. If you find a sweet spot, the bass can be kept at enjoyable levels and the music and movies become quite immersive, but the slider is nothing more than a gimmick under 60-70% volume. The bass is quantitative not qualitative and is loose and sloppy, not tight and responsive. The highs are fairly well balanced with the bass, so if you like a V shaped curve on the EQ, you will be pleased with these headphones. They are made for a very niche category of people.

I hope you find this helpful."
6619,3.0,"Alright what I'm writing is an issue not just me but several people are facing after buying these headphones.The thing is that these headphones have very good sound quality and nice bass and all but one thing I want you all to keep in mind while buying these headphones is that the hinges are nice but they are fragile. If you are a person who uses headphones much then this is not for you. I bought these headphones is June 2021 but even before 1 year the hinges broke off and the bigger problem is that you cannot get it repaired cause skullcandy doesn't have any service centers in india, nor do they sell the hinges. A lot of people have to buy 3d printed hinges 3rd party hinges just cuz skullcandy has no solution for this problem. If you don't trust me you can search it on the web. Also I asked them if they could replace it cuz i hadn't even dropped it once.Most of the people here are writing reviews after just a few days so they'll obviously say that it is very good, the best and all that but as I'm writing this review after more than a year so i hope you understand that I've had this headphone long enough to understand a few things. SO THE CONCLUSION IS THAT IF YOU ARE GONNA USE HEADPHONES A LOT THEN THEN IT'S NOT FOR YOU BUT IF YOU LISTEN TO MUSIC OR DO GAMING ONCE IN A WHILE THEN IT MIGHT LAST LONG(ATLEAST LONGER THAN 1 YEAR)."
6620,4.0,"Anyone looking to buy some good headphones that could help in work from home as for that we need good mic, listening to every single type of genre of music, watching movies. These headphones can do it all, without even thinking twice just go for these. I have seen people saying these are very base yes they are because these are skullcandy crushers and beautiful thing is these headphones give you tue freedom to adjust the base according to your needs that’s lit. So if according to you base is more just reduce it but if you ask me it has overall very well balanced sound.

I have been using them for a week now the headphones is amazing have a skullcandy signature sound for which they are really famous. Every single acoustic can be clearly heard, if some is looking for ANC then these might not be suited for them as they offer good passive noise cancellation which I needed not the active one. Seeing the price they are being offered just go for them.

I literally enjoy work from home with these headphones and sideways when I want I can enjoy the premium music coming from these headphones. Only thing that I see to be noted is that these are l’ll heavy but by the time passes you will get used to it. Like for example I can wear them for straight more than 3 hours after that I would tke a little break put them off and then wear them again."
6621,4.0,"Unbeatable, Unbelievable, Incredible and Amazing Experience, When I use my Crusher at 80% I feels like sitting in front of my Logitech Z906 Home Theatre running at 60%, it's incredible, if you are looking to buy this
Plz Read my Detailed Review Below...

Sound Quality :- Quality is Good, Sound is clear but little bit heavy when bass level is above 50% Sound Quality can be improved, many other brands like Audio Technica, Sony and Philips, provide Very Good Sound Quality but their bass level is low.

BASS :- Wow it provide very good decent punchy bass, Bass Control is very helpful, It's complete package of Home Theatre Experience and Deep Bass Headphones,
At 10-30% it provides very good quality sound with perfect bass like Sony Extra Bass,
At 40-60% Feels like Amazing Deep Bass little bit Vibration make it more immersive experience, when watching Movies or Playing Pubg listing High Bass Music,
Above 80% Lots of Vibration, it's Amazing Experience yes it's more vibration then Bass, but still amazing experience it feels like sitting just in front of Home Theatre Subwoofer but we can't listen it for longer then 20-30mins but I love it, No other can compete with this.

Battery :- WOW battery backup is Insane no other brand can provide this type of battery backup with this amount of bass and good sound Quality, my phone battery can't run better than this, 36-38hr battery backup when playing music non-stop, wow and charging time is 1-1/2hr only, very very good battery backup and Bluetooth range.

Noise Isolation :- It's comes with Passive Noise Cancellation rather than Activate noise cancellation, but it's works, it provides very good noise cancellation when using this at 30-40% level it provide good noise cancellation, but at 70-80% wow u can't say train/bus/aeroplane running nearby it's really amazing, but yes any nearby person can listen what you are hearing, but as it passive noise cancellation it provides very good noise cancellatio, I give 4.5 out of 5

Comfort :- Leather, rubber etc lots an lots of good quality material used for making these headphones comfortable, it's looks very premium and it is very premium BUT it's little bit uncomfortable at earcup when I wear it for more than 3-4 hr, not very good for summer season but perfect for winter.

Detailed Rating :-
Sound Quality 4 out of 5
Bass Quality 4.9 out of 5
Battery backup 5 out of 5
Charging time 5 out of 5
Bluetooth range 4.6 out of 5
Comfort 4.6 out of 5
Wire Quality 4.7 out of 5

What in-box ?
AUX cable, microUSB Charging Cable, Manual, Warranty Card, Bill, How to Use Manual, Carrying Pouch, And Crusher headphone.

Then Should I buy this or not ?
If you are a bass lover, means Bass is everything then yes, I'm a bass lover, I love bass with good sound Quality that's why I bought this.
If you are a Youngster want to buy overhead headphones for style, buy any budget headphones.
If you are a average user, looking for decent sound Quality and deep bass/ punchy bass buy this or buy audio technica m series, or Sony/Philips overhead headphones.
If you are studio user who need flat sound and limited bass these are not studio headphones at all.
If you are a Music Lover, yes go for it, don't think twice if you are a bass lover, music lover, want to feel move theatre at home, want to feel the bass, or Hi-Fi User who want best headphones without compromising anything, buy this without double thought, YES it's Costly BUT it's Value for Money, 9K for Headphones is very High BUT it's one time investment, buy once forget for 8-10years.."
6622,5.0,"! I am not adding any pics becz you know how it looks !
I am writing here is the first in hand impression...
#No dought, It is a skull crusher... As a best example You can say that this as a walking home theater.
# ears get's tickled while hearing.. that much of bass. same like we sitting in a car fitted with aftermarket audio system.
#Bass is astonishing... With bass slider we can set what amount of bass we need... IT's really amazing
For those who is looking for bass headset go for this, please don't look for any other sets...

PROS
-since it's using extra driver for bass, the bass does not compromise the vocals.
-super comfortable on over head
-control buttons are so easy to handle
***IT's head rattling bass!!!!***

CONS
-only single device can be connected at a time... this one major flaw I got
(but remember, competitors of this pair such as sonyxb700 Bluetooth also have only one device connectivity)"
6623,4.0,"I bought this headphones only for bass nothing else. I have done my research and gone through as many reviews on internet possible. Many have said wrong things about it but majority accepts the Skullcandy Crusher's dominance in the bass department. So I made up mind and got this instead of Sony XB950 which was the only real challenger for Crusher in this price range. Honestly I don't know how the Sony sounds since I have never tried it. My expectations was quite high before I received my package. The crusher literally blew me out despite my unrealistic expectations. This much bass in a headphone really? that's unbelievable you gotta listen to it to believe it. My only worry about it before purchasing one was 'what if it is all vibrations or some fake bass?' but believe me and stop listening to critics saying so. It's not vibration it's real as hell. Yeah, think about you put your ears close to a large sub woofer all you hear is vibration and rumble right? Is that fake? No its natural, the deeper the bass is the more vibration is. That's exactly what you can hear with this headphone. Let me be honest I am not a fan of the overkill bass that some enjoy in their car. The wild and crazy vibration happens only if you turn the bass slider all the way up which is unbearable to listen to for long. I enjoy tight mid range bass more than vibrating bass. So I don't even have to move that bass slider at all. This already has more than enough bass without the slider. For some bass heavy songs with emphasis on very low deep bass I would slide it just a quarter max and that will give you that sub woofer effect more than you need. The problem with going crazy with the slider is that it takes away the mids and highs away and all you can hear is overpowering bass. Nonetheless the option is there for the user to decide how much bass they want. My only concern about this headphone is that it can't really perform well at lower volume. You have to start from at least 50% to get a decent loudness. Anything below 50% is too quiet. I don't know if it has something to do with my laptop's Bluetooth quality because I get little more loudness using it with my iPhone with the same volume level. I used to listen to music at 25% using my Sony XB450 which costs only 1800 Rupees (about 25 USD) which is pretty loud even at that level. I think this is probably a common problem among headphones with larger drivers as they need more output power to operate. But it's no big deal anyway. Your new normal listening volume level will be 50 instead of 30 if you have switched from a smaller headphone to something like the Crusher like myself. Once again don't expect too much clarity on mids and highs with this as this is purely a basshead headphone. Mids and highs are good but not great. I had a little trouble with Bluetooth connectivity too. I had to reset the headphone a couple of times to get it detected by my PC which is a bit worrisome but it's been only a few hours since I got my dream headphone. I am figuring it out. In conclusion this is probably the best bass headphone in the world for this price range. I would like to hear from people who got XB950s on how it sounds. I am proud that I have spent my money wisely and got something worth more than the money."
6624,5.0,"So I received this pair yesterday (26th March '21).
The product was broken from the hinge, had a torn ear cup and when I opened it, the box had a cheap cellotape to seal it and the headphone was kept out of the pouch (in all unboxing videos I have observed a brand new one usually comes kept in the pouch). So obviously I was provided with a used one. It would be unfair to give a one star rating to the headphones cuz of that!
I did return the headphones and received the refund and have ordered for Rs. 6499 from Skullcandy's official website (No sellers on Amazon had it under 7894 as on the purchase date)! But before that I did test the broken piece for its overall sound quality.

Coming to a genuine review:

1) Highs, Lows and Mids - Highs and Mids are decent. The vocals might be disappointing while pairing with a low range android device like nokia 5.1 plus (however, I have also paired with an iPhone XR and it sounds great). Also pluggin in the 3.5 mm jack gives the overall quality a drop.
The lows/bass are pretty good if bass slider is adjusted just at an optimal level (10-15% of the total slide path).

2) Build quality - looks sterdy as I have felt. However I would have to try it for a longer duration to fully test it out.

3) Comfort - I have used a lot of headphones in my life and hands down this is one of the most comfortable headphones for my ears. I don't have a huge pair of ears.
The comfort level is subjective however.

4) Value for money- Well, I got it for a steal deal from Skullcandy's official website for 6.5k (compared to Amazon's 7.8k) and truly is a bang for buck at that price point.

5) Call Quality- It's decent and does the job. Won't recommend this if calling is your main priority

Overall I would say it's a headphone for a casual user and one who doesn't mind experimenting with a funky bass. EDM and Hard rock lovers will adore this especially!

However, if you need to hear perfect vocals like as in classical music, I would recommend going for a Beyerdynamics or Audio Technica headphone (that too wired)."
6625,5.0,Good product
6626,4.0,It's a beast that needs to be handled smartly! At first I thought the bass is overpowering the music (may b coz I heard/read other people saying the same in der review) but later after using for a while I found that we need to set our equilizer accordingly. It's definitely delivers great performance when it comes to bass and overall music quality. I bought it for around 8k which I belive is a very good amount for such amazing headset! Thanks Skullcandy for such wonderful experience n thanks to Amazon for such amazing discount! You will surely discover the bass guitar in the songs that u already heard but the sound of bass guitar went unnoticed most of the time.. Recommended for bass lovers!
6627,4.0,"Hii..I am reviewing after 20 days. So if you want to buy a handphone for yourself u must keep some basic points in your mind other than sound quality like connectivity battery and comfortablity while using.so here is my review

1- sound quality- as is mention in name crusher it will literally crush your skull .base is awesome mean full base pr tum 10 minute se jyada use nhi kr paoge .ese purchase krne k bad aisa lgta h jaisa khud ka DJ H APNE PASS. Her ek vocals jis clearity k sath sunai denge na rha nhi jayega such mai

2- BATTERY — bhut hai 20 din mai 3 hi bar. Charge kiya hia bus (5/5)

3- CONNECTIVITY- Guys jaise earphones (one plus wireless z) ki hai usse kam h thodi 20ft k bad buffering start ho jati h yahi ek prblm lagi muje toh aur auto connectivity hoti toh batter tha
BASE ADJUST KRTE TYM BHI BUFFER MIL SKTA H KABHI KABHI

4- comfortable— built quality bhut lajawaab hone k bad bhi 10-15 minut k bad pain hota h between your ear and cheeks (mera head size bda h tooh sayad ye prblm muje ho rhi ho )"
6628,5.0,"It's all about the BASS! if you are a bass lover, these are built for you. Next level experience. Don't worry about the mids and higs.. They are crisp and clear aswell. If you turn the slider all the way up, then the bass won't be bearable and it feels like the sound quality has dropped. Build quality is also good. The best part of these is the battery.. It is Undrainable.Overall a great headphone with ultimate bass. I'm writing this review after about 1 month of usage.. it's totally worth it."
6629,4.0,"Finally got what I was finding for a few days. It's really awesome and perfectly designed for music. Bass is absolutely amazing. The connectivity is so fast. Loved it. And the battery backup, it too good. After a charge i used it for a week.
Totally satisfied."
6630,5.0,"Guys, I was also desperate and excited like you guys and reading reviews like you people at the time of purchase.

I read lots of reviews like headphone plastic quality is not good and there is no after sales service provided by them.

But, at that time I was pretty confident and skullcandy is the biggest brand. So, honestly I thought that what physical damage can happen to 10k product !!! Also I thought that I'm the only single user who will gonna use the headphones so, I will be careful as much as possible.

And then finally I ordered it  and after a very gentle use of 6 months it broke from the cheap plastic joint!!!
Trust me that it was the single handed used by me. And it's automatically broken like any cheap plastic which we generally see in the cheap toys. Plastic is too too cheap. You cannot expect this from the 10k product.

*Learned life long lesson from the after sales service*
I contacted the customer care of skullcandy which is 'brandeyes' for the India and all over the India there is one and only service center and it's located in the Noida-Uttar Pradesh. So be very very careful that if you are not living in the Noida then you are in a big trouble.

Because after contacting them on the customer care number nobody picked the call. I tried continuously for one 1 week on this number '0120-4341341'. (Small suggestion: If anybody planning to buy this product just try to call on this customer care number at least once. If they picked your call then you can happily buy it :).  

After that I mailed on their 'customercare@brandeyes.in' id. Again no reply got from them. Only they generate one ticket and told that they will reach out to me in two working days. But they will not. I escalate this issue even on other email given in their site. Still I didn't got any reply.

I again checked on the net that same issue has been faced by many many users of this crusher skullcandy product.
Even you can check this on the twitter and here also in Amazon reviews. See the similar story and pictures like me and read the reviews.
So, from those review I came to know that company is not accepting warranty claim for the physical damage like our case. So be very very careful. There will be no fault from the my side, it automatically broke due to cheap material still they will accept the warranty claim.

So, guys please always remember the thumb rule before purchasing any costly product which I learned from this incident:
1. Always check the after sales service.
2. Always check the Warranty conditions.
3. Always check whether Service center is located in your city or not.
4. Try their customer care numbers before purchasing whether they picking the call or not.

Because it's ultimately our hard earned money and if aftersales service is poor than you will only regret like me. "
6631,5.0,"As this headphones doesn't have Active Noise Cancellation (ANC), still it does cancel the noises outside when u start hearing your sounds

Good quality of material used looks premium

Even after 40 hours of battery use actually as per my usage it took after 2-3 weeks to charge my headphones, we can use the Aux cable provided by Skullcandy itself and continue using the headphones and for the info yes the bass slider works with Aux

And skullcandy gave a good pouch for the headphones which is really great and its a good quality too"
6632,1.0,"I read and read a lot about it before I brought one . Because I love bass and Bose QC has all what music has to offer, but for me it was life less without the heavy bass note ( owned nothing but Bose till date) . I needed bass to boost my spirits up. Hence opted this after my research on various head phones.

Truth : keep the bass at Max : u guys gonna hate it ! Noisy , no clarity with vocals , just flat vibrations on ur ears ( I ain't comparing the voice clarity with Bose or any other head phones , it's just generic ) . Overall u can't enjoy music .
My question is : why would some one wanna do that ? U just can't hear a thing !!!!!!

It's a nice thing that it's got a bass level adjuster .

Keep it on mid note or slightly lower (would recommend 40%)
You will love what an ear phone has to offer with respect to the bass front .
Would feel like u are taking a 2:1 woofer and walking along . ( Dont over expect the bass , but it's good ! (Not awesome or mind blowing)

I'm satisfied with the performance as at 40% the bass is lovely , strong enuf to pump me up and at the same time , the vocals and music of various diverse frequency is heard clearly !

I'm giving it a four star coz this sucks at high bass boost .
But at the same time , I ain't regretting for having brought it.

Go for it . Be polite with ur bass expectations , if so you will love it ! ;-)

Hope u guys found it helpful"
6633,4.0,"Okay. I was very excited when I purchased this. Read reviews and heard it's one of the best high bass headphones. N finally I purchased it.
1. Sound quality - quality is same as any good headphones which may be lower in rate.
2. Battery life - it's been what 20 days since I purchased it. N must be listening to it around 2 hrs average. I never charged it. Still using the backup it came up with. It's still showing half of juice left. INSANE.
3. Bass - I was very excited about this. But believe me its just a gimmick. You'll start getting uncomfortable after sometime. It's more of vibration than so called bass. It come up with haptic engine used by Apple as well. So it vibrates to give bass effect. Now I don't increase the bass at all. It's better that ways.
VERDICT - it's expensive, buy something around 5k and it'll serve the purpose. Battery is no doubt insane that the only thing keeping me from regretting the purchase. And bass is just a gimmick which can be avoided. So choose wisely!"
6634,4.0,"I mean for under 10,000. A perfect pair of headphones for your music, movie, games needs. I usually use them for listening to music while commuting or playing games in my free hour, And before this I owned a pair of AKG headphones. While playing the games especially when I shoot bullets or bombs in PUBG, or Battlefield you can feel the blasts around you there's no more shreiking noise that force you to put volume low instead there's a bham-bham bullet echo with brilliant bass.
For music I can tell, if you really wanna test. Listen to Get low ( DJ snake ). I mean you ok understand after that demonstration of bass power these little orbs posses.
Build is fantastic not cheap plastic but very premium plastic and well I don't like the word plastic anyway for headphones but I feel that the slider in the headphone just made me drool over the design. It's so smooth that you feel like real proud for owning them and can't wait for people to ask how are these. You just slid them your pair and let them judge for themselves. Only real bite to the eyes are the wires are outside but it can be overlooked coz after 40 Hrs of battery life I don't think you would bother looking at the wire. I mean you can't stand in front of mirror for 40hrs and try to judge them by the wires xD.

Noise cancellation. Ummm only passive no real dedicated deal to give you noise cancellation but if you ask me that bass won't let you hear the noise anyway. With all the bhooooom in your years. Nope very less chance for the noise to penetrate that.

Although there are few things that makes me come forward with it that is the sound leaks from the headphones quite more than slightly so if you planning to watch porn with the blasting volume I mind, you keep it low otherwise people around you might just feel free to the sound.

Oh yeah I returned my first batch coz of some problem in the slider but the next batch of headphones came from one month prior batch. And I felt there that there was more distortion in the first pair of headphones and in the next pair there was no distortion if I slide the bass all the way up. So mind your head."
6635,3.0,Sound and bass was good. Build quality is 9/10 but performance 😂 joke on the rocks 😂
6636,5.0,"Bought this as an entry level head phones based on a friend's recommendation. Very good value for money. Looks and feels like a premium piece. I use it extensively and even or regular calls . You will not go back to using a mobile , directly. The sound quality is exceptional and just right for me. I don't use the bass too much , its fun for a while and at low levels only. The Bluetooth connectivity is spot on. Paired it with one phone only. A few times , it fails to connect automatically. But , other than that, hardly any issues

Two negatives. One is the UX cable With Microphone & Remote which they provide. Not top quality and it has started to give me audio issues . I connect these to my office laptop for calls. And now can't do that anymore. The second issue is the quality of the ear pads. 8 months of extensive usage and the ear pads are wearing off at the sides and even a bit inside. Currently searching for earpads to replace . W"
6637,3.0,"[UPDATE]

I used this headphone for 1 year now and here are the cons:

1. Only 1 Bluetooth device will be connected at a time, suppose you are to shift to PC after using it on your mobile you will have to reset the headphone so that it will connect to your PC

2. The hinge is quite delicate and it broke off within 2 months. I had to go for customer support and sadly it took me almost 7 months to get my product replaced(I was told it will be repaired but due to their lack of professionalism they decided to send a new pair of headphones which was good in my personal opinion but surely it won't happen to everyone so be careful. Customer Service in India sucks badly for SkullCandy)

I had a budget of 5000/- for headphones but I extended it to 8000/- just because of these headphones.

Things I have noticed so far:

1. Bass booster as many said is just a vibration, I'd say it's not true. It feels like vibrating due to high bass on such a small device. Don't believe them and it's nothing like uncomfortable to your ears.

2. I don't feel any weight on my head, obviously, it's a huge pair of headphones but the comfortable cushions makes it possible to wear them for 2+ hours straight.

3. Bluetooth connectivity and AUX connectivity, no difference between them. The audio quality is noticeably same

4. Battery life is beyond expectations. I bought these headphones at 32% charge and I watched two movies on it as of now. And the battery is 30%. I'm surprised

5. I chose the white color over black. And just to confirm it's actually cream not white. So think before buying it. The pics are totally different from the actual device

6. Buttons are solid and the size-shifting mechanism is strong. Not like people mentioned that it got broke easily. Nothing like that. You can use it comfortably. It's durable"
6638,4.0,"As you can see from the reviews the hinge is easily damaged and they don't cover it in warranty, bad build quality and awful service from their customer care. Bad investment."
6639,5.0,Unable to connect Bluetooth.
6640,1.0,"One of the best sounding resonable priced headphone I owned, but the cheap plastic build ruined the experience. Yep it is broken from the folding hinge.. 1 year of usage came out of it.."
6641,4.0,"Crusher is a very appropriate name provided to the product as it crushes your dream of owning a costly pair of headphones, expecting it to be high quality product. Product no doubt has a great sound, but what is the use if the plastic housing the entire circuit and machinery is made from poor quality plastic.

Guess what?? I had contacted the replacement department of the Indian skull candy dealer(brand eyes) and they further CRUSHED my hopes of ever using these headphones. Even though they are in warranty period, they refuse to replace it due to external damage due to the following reasons

1)Warranty shall be void if the product has been opened, attended at any unauthorized service center or third party.
2)Faults of which the purchaser was already aware of at the time of purchase.
3)Damage by any violent head-banging session (wearing the headphone improper way).
4)Faults due to accident, lightening, misuse and ingress of water/moisture.
5)Faults due to wear and tear and force majeure.
6)Faults due to exposure to caustic substances, fire, improper ventilation, dropping, mishandling or excessive shock or any external cause beyond Skullcandy’s control and/or any damage caused due to tampering of the product by an unauthorized agent.
7)Warranty shall not cover any damages resulting from un-authorized adaptations, improper or reckless use, damage on account of high ampere charging, defined as charging ampere > 1.1A or unattended long duration of charge exceeding 30 mins.

My damage didn't fall in any of the policies stated above but still the customer care would respond with automated replies and wouldn't tend to issues of replacing a small part. I am just asking to replace the hinge , but they wouldn't listen at all .

If you purchase these and when you want to use them, you would want to take them and unfold them , but listen if you unfold them slowly and carefully and what if the hinge breaks?!! it is better to use them as speakers! but be careful don't touch them! the headphone might still break. It should be renamed as Skullcandy Delicate® Series or Dream® Crusher"
6642,3.0,"If you're considering to buy any product from Skullcandy, you like bass and warm tones of music, you're not a hard core audiophile but you love a product that stands justified for its cost. You want an unapologetic, power-packed, behemoth of a product that satisfies your urges of a great listening without creating a hole in your pocket( cases in point- Beats, Sennheiser, Bang and Olufsen etc.). You're paying 9500 bucks for this product and that is still a lot of money but the product is worthy of the amount paid.
Unlike its predecessor, the product quality is better. The crusher line of headphones are known for the vibration that comes along with the bass but Crusher wireless sounds better than the others without the haptics turned on. Sometimes, you can hear the spring when you gently tap the headphones, which is a little annoying. When you turn on the haptics the middle notes get a little muddy, it might also be because of the vibration but it's there. If you're not an audiophile, you'll find these amazing. It's less bulkier than the Wired crushers. In summary, a high end product of low end brand is always better than a low end product of a high end brand.

PROS
Mind blowing bass
40 hours of battery and more, if you do not use the haptics quite as much.
Connectivity is amazing,
Great for long hours listening.
Adequate for watching movies and playing games.
There is option for multiple pairing as well.(You can pair multiple devices at once)
Better Design with plush materials
Comes with a 3.5 mm jack for an option of wired listening.

CONS
You can hear the haptic spring sometimes.

I used sony mdr650 for almost 2 years and they never disappointed me. Almost 2 years after, they broke from hinges but still work and I love the crisp clear audio from them. After those, I was hooked to sony so decided to upgrade to it’s big bro mdr950. The 950 had a bass boost button which was cherry on the cake. The clarity of acoustic/treble is simply unmatched in sony.

Today, I got skullcandy crushers. They looked beautiful and I had alreay heard a lot about their bass feature. After wearing it for the first time, I noticed that I could hear spring noises as soon as I pat on them. Even a gently tap on them would yeild an annoying noise.

Coming to the output- the acoustics and treble is not upto sony mdr950. The sony did a great job here.
Boost slider in crushers was something which sounded like artificially boosted after 30%. The feature looks quite appealing at the time of purchase but trust me you won’t even use it after some time.

Build quality of crushers looks a little better than sony.

Crushers are more comfortable than sony.

Crushers has a lot better battery life but sony also doesn’t run out of juice easily.

Crushers has a plus point of bass slider working in aux mode as well. Sony’s bass button doesn’t work in aux.

Overall if you ask me, I will recommend sony mdr950 over crusher wireless because it has perfectly balanced audio which sounds much natural than crushers."
6644,4.0,Good
6645,3.0,"Overall a good product, writing review after one year of use, bass is amazing, for movie watchin and general music listening, cushion did come off a bit. Bass control slider is magic"
6646,5.0,"For those who want an unbiased review, read along.

Pros:
1. Extremely awesome Bass - Forget about the bass slider, the bass is just purely awesome when the slider is completely lowered. It's epic when you boost the slider up.
2. Doesn't feel heavy despite the headphone weight.
3. This has a spectacular battery backup, just one charge will go almost a week. I always use this, and it did.
4. Value for Money - You won't find a match for this at this price range.
5. You'll love it when you watch action movies, you can have the theatrical effect.
6. The ear cups are so comfortable, you'll just love it. Trust me!

Cons:
1. It's made of plastic around the hinges, so doesn't feel that premium.
2. When you increase the bass slider, you'll lose treble and might barely pick up the sounds in that frequency. To adjust that you need to increase the volume.
3. Bass slider doesn't feel premium either. It's just all wobbly.
4. Headphones has to be used delicately, just in case you don't break the hinges.
5. The buttons for power and volume feels cheap, but that wouldn't affect your music experience though.
6. You need to extremely careful about the popping out wires, just in case they don't get stuck somewhere and you tearing it out pulling the headphones without even realizing it.

Verdict: Well, it's all about the experience which outweighs all the cons here. You'll just have to extra careful, but other than that this is so worthy for the price. You wouldn't find a match for this in this price range. If have set your mind to purchase this, don't take second opinion and BUY THIS HEADPHONE. :)

GOOD DAY!"
6647,5.0,"I am writing this review after 2 months of usage and experience......

First I will say the pros...

1. Amazing sound quality
2. Mind blowing battery life
3. The bass and bass control feature
4. Portability
5. Hassle free connectivity
6. Premium look
7. Soft ear cushion
8. Charging indicator ( Red & Green )
9. Even though it doesn’t have noise canceling feature it does blocks some sound

Now I will talk about the cons....

1. While using for the first time, it feels uncomfortable , but I guarantee you once you get used to it like 3,4 weeks you will surely love it
2. If you are using this head phone while walking(hard) , you can hear some spring noise sort of thing ( when the music is at very low volume or when the headphone is off)

3. Sometimes when you watch movies over the Bluetooth and when the bass ( very low ) kicks in some sort of distortion is heard , but when switched to aux the audio is much better

Now I will talk why I chose skull candy over Sony XB-950BT

1. Sony has very flimsy body

2. Doesn’t have bass control feature,
Believe me you will never have to use 100% bass in these headphones, so skullcandy has the functionality right at your fingertip while the Sony is through the app 😖

3. Batter life
With one charge it would probably go for 3,4 weeks of normal ( 50% base , Bluetooth, medium volume ) use
In 2 months I’ve only charges it 4 times....we can still enjoy music even when the headset is dead and too having the bass control feature

Final thoughts....

I would really really recommend this headset for bass lovers and those whose are addicted to music especially EDM.....
Once you get used with this headphone you will never feel like you wasted your money

REAL VALUE FOR MONEY PRODUCT 💯"
6648,5.0,"Hello Guys,
I don't usually write reviews for products, however, I fell like writing for this one considering the fact that most of people are confused between Sony xb950b1 and Skullcandy crusher.

Let me tell you my story- I bought these headphones after researching a lot. I read a lot of reviews and watched many videos.
There were positives and negatives for both the headphones. Some were claiming that sound on Skullcandy crusher isn't great while some were saying it was slightly better than Sony. Others were saying Sony sounds better. Nevertheless, Sony xb950b1 has another problem that put people off form buying them i. e. build quality. A lot of people complain abouts these breaking easily and I found many reviews on the same on Amazon.com.
So, finally, though Sony seems to be a better choice, I bought Skullcandy crusher just because I didn't want to my headphones to break within a month.
I received the Crushers and didn't waste time to paired them with my OP6... And and within 15 min I put them back into box!! They sound so ARTIFICIAL!! Their BASS is fake. It hurts your ears after a while. You don't feel the natural bass.. It is just isn't natural!! I was so upset.

Next day I went to a local market to tried Sony Xb950b1 and man this is how a headphone should sound... Amazing natural bass which makes you happy :) You feel like dancing.

I bought Sony Xb950b1 instantly :)

Enjoy the music... And Yes Sony is Sony when comes to music quality."
6649,5.0,Didn't get the pouch with the product. Was missing the pouch.
6650,3.0,"These headphones are good best in segment.
Only there is one cons you can't wear them for long duration. Your ears will start to pain if you are not use to headphones then be ready for some pain and great sound"
6651,1.0,"Amazing sound quality. This is not a ‘noise cancellation’ head-set, but it cancels a lot of ambient noise and only thing going through your ears is the sound form your headphones.
The haptic bass is too good. You can feel the Vibrations. Keeping the slider on ‘high’ might hamper the vocals and the lows. But again, it can be adjusted to ones preference.
The ear-muffs are soft and hugs your ears nicely. Just wished they'd turn 90 degrees, too. Coz, if you have to put it around your neck, you have to sit upright.
The volume and on/off buttons are nice n big. But it starts getting some sort of border around it. My be dust or finger marks. Also, the inside of the 'haptic bass' slider could have had a mat finish. Being glossy, it gets scratched easily and is visible.

The battery back-up is amazing. It goes on for days if you are using it for few hours everyday. Also, there is a 3.1mm jack, incase the battery dries up

Problem arises when you connect the crushers to a device, (your Mac or your android device) the bluetooth on your iPhone starts (as I have paired it) and it starts conflicting with the crushers, hence connectivity gets affected. The concept of connecting to ‘many devices’ becomes an issue. Now I have to go to my iPhone settings and turn-off the bluetooth as turning it off from the control centre dsnt help, because IOS connects automatically when it detects any near-by bluetooth device.

Also, my device didn't have a laminated cover over the box. I just hope they are genuine and the service guys won't create a fuzz if, someday, I have to take them to the service centre."
6652,4.0,Call quality should be improved
6653,5.0,"Its not for studio audio pro users. Its only for everyone who like bass. Sound is very good. Battery life is the best that you can get on any bluetooth headset right now. When it turns on and off you can see a purple light indicator. And if you put them on you can hear it say that its on.
To connect with a device you have to press and hold the power key for 3 seconds then it will show the bt headset on your device.
When its searching for bt device it blinks red and blue light indicator.
When its charging red light indicates charging and after 2 and a half hour it will fully charge and green light will indicate that its fully charged.

If you compare with other brands within this price range none can compete with it. I have used Sony / BoAt / Jbl etc but this is something.

IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR GAMING USE I WILL SUGGEST THAT USE IT WITH WIRES. THERE IS A 3.5 MM JACK WITH A BUILT IN MIC IN THE BOX. USE IT FOR BETTER GAMING EXPERIANCE.

Pros : *Good sound quality.
*best battery life.
*bass you really feel with adjustable bass slider.
* premium quality.
* will not fall from your head

Cons: when you use it for the first time it will clam your head hard. After 1 or 2 days of usage it becomes normal.
The haptic engine that provides the head shaking bass comes fraction of a second late.

*** if you are looking for a headphone for listening music and enjoy like its party everytime. Buy it now. Its for fun listening and enjoying life.***

# the plastic joints broke after 6 months.. So be careful...!!!"
6654,3.0,"Audiophiles and those looking for a relatively accurate sound will want to keep looking, but those into boosted bass may appreciate what these headphones have to offer. That’s because these headphones can seriously pump out the bass — to unsafe levels if you so choose.

Skullcandy Crusher Wireless Ports

With the bass boost switch turned all the way down, the bass is actually relatively well-tuned. It’s strong and powerful, to be sure, but it won’t blow your brains out. Turn that bass boost switch up, and all that changes — to the point that the headphones actually vibrate with the bass and it feels like a subwoofer has been implanted into your brain. Ridiculous? Absolutely, but the good thing here is that the listener has control. The headphones also seem to be built to resonate at a certain frequency, which further helps make that bass sound even stronger than it is. That makes these headphones perfect for the mega-bass fans out there, and even they might need to keep the bass boost at relatively low levels.

The mid-range is decently well-tuned, with a warm and present low-mids, and a high-mids that seems to dip slightly. The high-end is also slightly dipped — but that’s not all that unexpected from a pair of headphones aimed at being so bass-heavy. That’s not to say that the high frequencies aren’t there either — they are. It’s just that they could be boosted a little.

The headphones offer decent stereo separation, and don’t seem to technically distort very easily — which is a good thing."
6655,5.0,"First time buyer, was not very sure of the quality as most of the reviews online give negative reviews, bought it anyway, I just don’t see what the fuss is about, I have owned headphones from other manufacturers and at this price Skullcandy crusher is a great pair of headphones for the price (provided you are a bass head). The bass is just mind blowing, I know it is haptic driven but who cares. If you looking for a more balanced sound then I don’t recommend these. The quality is acceptable, the finish however is amazing. If the midrange was slightly better then these would be mind blowing. Comfortable to wear, extremely good battery life. Overall the best thump for your buck"
6656,5.0,"Superb battery performance, mind-blowing bass, bluetooth connectivity is good. If. You are looking for long Lasting headphones go for it... This have a bass controller which feels like a subwoofer and watching movies will give you home theatre experience. I have purchased 6 months ago and enjoying. I keep this with my travelling it's comes with a pouch which is quite fine... And also with one aux cable in case of battery go down you can connect and play. But once you charge it really lasts for 3-4 days depends upon your usage. Good product. Just one point to know this is a foldable headphones so you need to little patient while opening and closing it."
6657,5.0,Product was received in a old box. Edges of box had small paper tearings. Due to weight we can feel pain on head after 10-15mins. At full bass we feel like a woofer playing in our ears.
6658,4.0,"Build Quality: Poor (1/5)
Ear Comfort: Ok, managable (2/5)
Ear cushion quality: Poor (1/5)
Sound Quality: Very Good (4/5)

Bass: Excellent (5/5)
Bluetooth Connectivity: Good (4/5)

VERDICT: Please dont invest 8-9k on this device as thwey will only last for about 8-12 months normal usage. You can go ahead and say that you will keep them in a sophisticated manner and what not but believe me because I thought the same myself.

Hello friends. My father is a basshead and he loves music. I have admired skullcandy crushers from the time when i first laid them on my ears. I borrowed them from a college friend at that time and made my life's goal to purchase them online and I did it by the end of 2018.

I gifted this headphone to my father and he enjoyed this headphone in the beginning. He used regularly for the first month and then weekly once and then monthly once because of his busy schedule.
After nearly one year of minimal usage, cracks started appearing near one of the folding hinge of the headphone. The Cushion's material started peeling off and the material underneath looked gross, destroying the vibe. I used steelgrip tape to cover the cracks and applied feviquick before!! Yes desi jugaad. Because, mind you, any physical damage is not covered in warranty and you are advised against wasting your time in contacting customer care which turned out with no results for me. So after that, the headphones plastic materials broke from the nearby 3 places near the hinge in the form of small fragments which i promise you cannot be fixed by feviquick or tapes and thats how the headphones look now in the images😞😞. Such a good quality headphone is a bummer all due to its poor build quality. So disappointing."
6659,1.0,"If you like bass more than anything else then this one is absolutely for you. It has so much bass with haptic engine that causes vibration that you will start to wonder if you really liked that heavy bass; complete justice to the name... it crushes your head with bass.
Probably not for an audiophile as its not a very clear mids and highs aren't too natural, however this headphone had the power to make you stay loving bassy songs.
The best part of this headphone is that you can drag the slider to choose pe jese amount of bass you love and that makes this headphone a perfect choice for bass lover.
I am using for over a month and battery performance is phenomenal, absolutely no competition there, fast charge is a bonus as you hardly may need it.
My recommendation, if you are inclined towards bass, just go for it without a second thought."
6660,1.0,"Simply awesome..I am a music lover..bought it in Januray 2018 at rs 9300..The Battery back up is just wow..charge it once in a month for 4 - 5 hours( yes i mean it ) and it will last till a month with even good amt of use..Sound quality is too good..the bass controller button makes it unique...and believe me this bass controller button is of too much use..you will need to change the bass level according to different songs, which is missing in sony.. yes its a little hard or tight whtevr to hold it on your head for a very long time initially you will feel( in this area sony is better) but later i got used to it..it is not a big problem...but it covers the ear fully and gives ur ears warm feeling..,no problem at all in that...Before buying it , i was very much confused between this and sony 950bt ( Allmost same price ) ..but finally bought this one..and honestly spkng, i am not regretting...U can go without any doubt with this one., specifically considering the Extra plus point in this with battery backup and bass controller buttons.."
6661,4.0,"These are well built, I have kicked them off of my bed (accidentally) and not a single scratch, also the sound quality is good , you need a good Equalizer application on your device for good quality don't blame it on the hardware it's not headphone's issue when you can tweak it to your preference, bass is Monster and comfortable around head and ears , extend the size for better comfort, they're light weight not heavy or bulky on head, people complained a lot about its bad quality but honestly there's nothing as such they're built to last easily the best in this price segment! Buttons are tactile and not at all mushy to use."
6662,4.0,"the first thing is if u r going or thinking of buying it , u should bcoz writing a review give false assumptions to people
u should feel it urself there are many other brands i dont want to force u to believe thats its a good choice
COMING TO THE PRODUCT:
1. its BASS SLIDER is the real DEAL (For BAss LOvers its definitely for u)
2. its battery is amazing
3. good passive noise cancellation But dont expect it to be the level of ANC coz it does not have it
4. Incredible sound quality.
CONS
1. The Bluetooth disconnects if u live inn a thick or heavy type of home in the sense(""yeah i know"" heavy thing)
it must be in a straight line path for its 10m range cant be obviously i think thats not a problem but if u really want
do ur home chores wearing it not for u , but if u a student or something like that u should go for it"
6663,5.0,"So I'm a bass lover and I just bought this headphone for the bass and this headphone is great for the bass.

But, there are some small issue like if you try to hear songs in full bass then it will just vibrate your ears. I mean there are a lot if vibrations. You can really feel the bass.

Sound quality is good but not best because you will not able to hear crystal clear sounds.

This headphone is great if you're watching MOVIE. GOD it is just amazing. It will be like you're watching movie in a theater and you will able to feel everything.

So this headphone is great according to its price."
6664,4.0,"Excellent headphones below 10k.

***Build Quality***
4/5
Everyone complaints about the hidges is breaking.
If your headphone is a multiuser or you roughly using then i think this might break.
So i recommend this if you alone using this.Also if you are a rough user then this might happen.

So just treat this as a product worth 10k then no issues :)

***Sound quality***
5/5
Hats off on that.

Definity this one is a way better than SONY MDR-XB950B1. I have used latter also.
Sony more costly. You are paying for brand value more than sound quality.
Mids, Highs, low everything is better in crushers. The bass slider is excellent that you can adjust bass.
You can feel real physical bass in this, on sony its just overpowered bass
Just don't belive the reviews of sony MDR-XB950B1 on the product page. People believe the brand value which give them satisfaction.
See some review sites like rtings.com and youtube comparison videos, crushers is always best.
***Comfort***
5/5

After watching a 2.5 hour movie, i felt no pain on my ears.

***Battery life***
5/5
Simply the best in segment. 40+ hrs"
6665,4.0,"Statuary warning - These headphones have some serious bass and can shake your brain as well as your skull.
Design - They come I an industrial packaging , a hard cardboard box , carrying case and some accessories. You guys will fall in love be with these headphones when you will tale them in your hands.
They fit like they are custom made for your ears.
Now comes the most important point for which you folks have been waiting so eagerly - sound quality
The headphones have 2 dedicated drivers in each cup , a 40mm driver for vocals and it also gives some decent amount of bass and a secondary driver 34mm driver purely for BASS . And the magic starts when you slide that slider up. Guys believe me that the bass will knock your socks off and some of you may also get goose bumps . The bass is not like a conventional 2-3k headphones or earphones , as the box says ""bass you can feel"" you will literally fell the bass it will shake your skull (physcall) . The bass is like the bass from a 20 inch subwoofer. The bass is leathal at 20 % of the slider up but beyond that point it will leave your jaws dropped.
They plus point is that that vocals dosent gets distorted even when the bass is very high and you can even enjoy the bass at low volume just slide that slider up and you will have some skull crushing bass.
Final words : if you are a bass head ,just close your eyes and spend 12 k on these you will never regret you have my word for that.
Now , for my pot smoker's , guys buy them without any doubt I just can't explain that bass experience when I am high ....its just breathe taking.❤"
6666,5.0,"Everything about this headphones is average if not bad.
Audio quality is decent when the haptic slider is kept at lowest settings. Increasing that slider degrades over all audio quality and gives a fake bass. It's fun at times but doesn't always gives good audio feel.

I knew all of the above before purchasing it. So no complaints at all.
BUT, the build quality is so cheap that I'm handling this thing like a new born child. I'm too worried if I drop it accidentally, that's the end of it. Even while wearing and removing the headphones I feel like it's gonna break if I tilt a bit more. Seriously guys build quality is that cheap and for the same reason this headphones should not be priced above INR 5000.

Battery backup is great. I could use it for 4 days without charging.

Bluetooth range is too short. Disconnects instantly if I move to the next room. I had a mi superbass headphones which had no issues with connectivity with 2 walls in between(I had to sell that one because everything else about that was bad)"
6667,5.0,"Like any confused buyer I researched on every medium I could lay my hands onto be it Youtube, review sites and specially Amazon reviews. Finally I zeroed on these beasts but I still had my doubts even after laying my hands on these.
Is the bass to high?
Do i really need a bass slider?
Should have I gone for Sony 950?
Luckily while on a trip I was able to lay my hands on few wireless headphones at a duty free and believe me that was the day I laid rest to my doubts once and for all.
These beasts knocked the likes of Sonys , Sennheisers and entry to mid level Beats out of the park. The feel, the comfort, the sound quality , the BASS were in no comparison to the Crusher. Even the battery life was the best among any other brand. Others felt like bland grandpa’s headphone in front of these.
Also regarding doubts of usefulness of the slider as sometimes stated otherwise by other here, I have to say that slider is the best and the most useful feature and its is actually quite important for bass heavy headphones like these. I use slider a lot, be it while watching a movie or while listening to slow and acoustic music.
Finnaly, my view regarding artificial vibrations for bass are that, these are bass heavy headphone and their purpose is to provide the wholesome experience of how bass works and the vibration enhances the experience exponentially atleast for me.
So therefore for confused bass head buyers like me I recommend that you can go for these beasts without any speck of doubt whatsoever and prepare for your brains to be CRUSHED."
6668,3.0,"This is one of the best headphones in the market at this price, especially if taking calls is also your priority. Its highlights are excellent mic and battery life! Here are my feedbacks:

Pros:
1. One of the best mic and sound quality offered during calls. If you are looking for a suitable wireless headphone that has decent noise cancellation and high call quality, this one is surely a choice. Provides pretty impressive audio quality too (Being a casual listener, I have felt the quality is good enough)
2. Very good battery capacity. I have used it for hours attending calls, listening to videos and songs, only to be charged hardly once a week! I turn it off when not in use, but this will also go to auto-sleep mode which can be configured through the app.
3. App based control and settings which makes it easier to set up and customize your personalized sound effects.

Cons:
1. Not suitable to be used while running or during work outs. This one fits perfectly for me but not enough to stay tight during workouts. This might obviously depend on the head size."
6669,5.0,Product was good sound quality as per the expectations
6670,4.0,"One of the best features I liked about these headphones is the customizability of the various sound aspects through the app. For example, I don't like the sidetone feature, so I just turned it off, a feature which is not customizable in most of the headphones. I can also increase/decrease the bass depending on my mood.
The battery backup is also extraordinary, one of the best.
Needless to say and pointed out by many others too: perfect for meetings as well.
This is an extremely worthy product for it's price."
6671,4.0,"My review is after 2 months of intense use. First of all, it is regrettable that this product is not well received inspite of offering so many features at a reasonable cost. So just as an happy customer of this product, I want to do some justice by writing a honest & a practical review of this product. Definitely this product deserves a better treatment.
Also I wanted to clarify certain features of this product which is misunderstood as a defect/ not existing.

For many years I was very uncomfortable using wired headphone as the wires get tangled & can't stretch or move away from laptop.But still I kept myself away from a bluetooth headphone because of the following reasons:
1.Battery capacity is vey less & it has to be charged frequently & for long hours incase of exhausted battery
2.Mic is not good for mobile voice calls
3.Very uncomfortable & painful after 2-3 hours of use (From the reviews for most of the very good brands)
4.Not very much compatible with office meeting softwares like Skype/Webex
5.Connecting single wireless headphone for both mobile & laptop is not that simple
6.Bluetooth connectivity not seamless
7.Range not good
8.Sound quality is not that great compared to wired

Now that I work from home for the past 6 months, there is a greater unavoidable need for me to use phone & laptop alternatively/simultaneously for all my voice interactions with the team for extended hours. Also working from home made me to listen to music quite often ( which was not the case before) .
All these forced needs, made me to lookout for a wireles headphone with
1.Multi device connectivity & ability to switch
between the devices easily
2.High battery capacity & Fast charging
3.Good mic for voice calls on mobile/laptop
4.Compatibility with Skype/Webex calls
5.Comfort for long hours
6.Seamless Bluetooth connectivity
7.Better Bluetooth range
8.Good sound signature
9.Last but not least , affordable

I found Jabra Elite 45H as the best fit for all my above expectations. I'm really happy to have bought this product.

Some highlights of the product from my personal experience (Android 10 Phone, Dell Business Laptop with Win 10, Skype , WebEx ):
. Bluetooth 5.0 - Quick & uninterrupted connection. I
could listen to the music when the
connected headphone & the mobile(Bluetooth 5.0)
are in different floors.
. Doesn't support AptxHD
. 40 mm Drivers - 24 bit Audio sounds great.Bass is
little soft compared to what I expected. But
for long hours usage , it is good to have soft bass.
. 50 Hours battery - 15 min. of quick charge gives
10 hrs & Charges 100% in 90 minutes.
. No 3.5mm jack . Can't be used in wiredmode.
. 2 mics- Good Indoor call quality
. Sleepmode time adjustment saves battery well
. Voice Assistants - Works very well when connected
to phone only.
. Voice based notification.Ex: Battery , Connected.
. Soundscapes ( preloaded sounds like bird songs,
rainy day, waterfall, caverns etc).I like it.
. Memory foam as earcushion- Soft. I could use it
continuously for 6-7 hrs daily.
. Lightweight.
. Firmware update through App.Did an update.
. 2 yr warranty against rain and dust
. Good looking Copper Black

Some reflections on other's review comments:
1. "" I hear voice echo""- It's not a defect. It's a feature
to listen to our own voice to know what other's
will hear.It can be disabled through the app.
2.""Headband is not adjustable""- I'm not sure if I
misunderstood the statement.Headband is
actually adjustable i.e you can pull/extend the
earpad to suit your head profile.
3.""Headband is loose""- It might not be a good fit for
small head profiles.
4.""Sound bleeds""- As it doesn't have Active Noise
Cancellation, it doesn't provide complete
insulation from surrounding sounds.
5. ""It doesn't connect to my laptop without
Bluetooth. It's a waste. "" - Please buy a Bluetooth
adapter from TP link to use such headphones. It's
not the fault of the product.

I've just shared my expectations vs experiences for this product. If your requirement is similar, this is definitely a great product to look for. Well done Jabra !!!"
6672,5.0,"Great headphones with nice cancellation mic, person on the other side cannot hear any noice even if you are in a traffic. But it captures if anyone speaks in background. Good for calls and meetings, just a decent one for music and bass."
6673,4.0,Although it's light in weight but grip is bit tight even after extending full which makes it bit u comfortable after wearing 15 mins.
6674,5.0,"I bought this pair in October 2020 and have been using this regularly. I use this product for work. Here is my long term review.

Pros:
1. Battery life is amazing. I can go through my entire work week without needing to charge these. That is about 6-7 hours of calls every day. And the battery performance has not deteriorated over time.
2. Call quality is good. The mics do a great job focusing on my voice and drowning out other sounds.
3. The headphones sound good to me. I am not an audiophile, though.
4. Does not have ANC, but the on the ear design does a decent job blocking out most external noise.
5. Decent bluetooth range.

Cons:
1. The biggest issue I am having is with the build quality. It hasn't been 2 years yet and the cushioning on the right ear is disintegrating (pics attached). Had definitely expected this product to last longer
2. Some minor glitches when switching between conferencing apps. Sometimes the mic stops working when I switch from a Zoom call to a Google Meet. Starts working when you switch off and on.
3. Have also faced some issues with the mute button while using Google Meet. Instead of muting me on the call, the button seems to mute me in windows. Have to unmute from the system sound settings. Not a pleasant experience when in a call.

Overall, this is a decent product. Value for money at 5.5k mark. But if you are a moderate to heavy user, do not expect to get more than 2 years out of these."
6675,5.0,"Good for Meeting, calls & music. After lot of research finally got it. Loved the product
Active Noise cancellation is not there, not recommended for Gym or sports"
6676,4.0,"Have been using it for more than 1 year. Bought it specifically for attending work calls and this didn't disappoint me at all. I was surprised by how clear my voice sounds to others in the meeting.
Sound quality noise cancellation are pretty decent.
It's easy on the ears and very comfortable. Only con is that the outer earphones layer which touches the ears tears off after an year of usage."
6677,4.0,"Like most people I was really really confused on getting a great headphones for work purpose. I kept hearing from people that they have spent 20-30 grand. I am writing this review after 3 months of daily usage.

And finally after days of searching I stumbled upon this product from Jabra. I was apprehensive but since i had to get one soon, I went for it. And boy, did I make the right decision..!

The biggest pro is the battery life. I recharge it like once every 5-8 days. I have calls for 3 hours daily.

The voice clarity is great. The other person can hear me crystal clear and I can hear them great too. My home environment is not noisy so the audio is quite clear. So I cannot comment on the Noise cancellation quality. I use it for Skype, Teams and Zoom meetings and works well on all these apps.

Music seems to be quite fine from it. I'm not too much into music so I'm not sure the exact requirements what a music head would want from a headset. But it serves the purpose and I'm happy about it.

The only con is- Mute button doesn't seem to work during calls. Works for music.

All in all a superb buy stuff you will not regret it..

PRO TIP:
1. During 1 meeting, the other person mentioned that the audio is quite unclear and bad. I was baffled. I turned it off and used my old headset for the rest of the day. The next day I turned this one ON and to my surprise it started working just fine. This is one off incident.

2. You can download the app and customise the audio as per your wish. There will be an echo when you speak and this is called as Sidetone. This happens so that you are aware of the volume of your speech that the other person hears. You can disable it once you are comfortable with your audio volume."
6678,5.0,"First , the good things:

1. the bluetooth connectivity is good. the device connects both to my phone and laptop and switches between them seamlessly.
2. the app is good - helps in settings, help , user guide etc..
3. build quality so far and the packaging is fine. Although its a new device for me.

However I will focus on cons more because I am not happy with the device.

1. Mic quality is bad. On phone, the other person finds the voice muffled. On ms teams also, similar issue. Sometimes the voice is not even there with ms teams. I checked if my mic is on mute but that's not the case. finally I had no option but switch back to my laptop mic for calls.
2. audio ( speaker ) quality is also average. I used to hear a background noise earlier in the speaker when the call started. This sound would come only when the call is on. That sound went away after I made some changes in settings in the app ( turned side tone off). But otherwise also, the sound quality is only good for calls - there is a kind of brittleness in the sound. This is not a device for listening to music."
6679,4.0,"We get less mobile signal in our home and wifi calling is not available on my mobile. I get office calls on mobile and MS Teams/Skype/WebEx are used on laptop for calls. So, I was looking for a cost effective and excellent over the ear dual pairing wireless solution which can be used for music listening as well. I experienced Jabra Elite 45h had filled that gap very well and . Below is the review.

With Jabra Sound + App
Call Quality:

I can hear other persons voice very clearly and no one has any complaint of my voice. I have boat airpods and folks tell me that my voice sounds coming from distance, however with this jabra headset, there ia no auch complaints.

Since it is over the ear and has ambient noise reduction feature, it blocks outside sound and my own voice is heard very less during the call, so to have feedback of our own voice, it has sidetone feature, and I was able to adjust how loud my voice sounds to me in the call. Very very nice feature. It can be turned off as well if required.

Also, I was able to customize and hear the other persons voice to have more bass or treble or neutral while listening other person.

It also notifies in between if microphone is muted or unmute.

Sound quality and Music Experience:
With 5 band Music Equalizer and 6 different Music presets to adjust bass, treble and speech, I was able to adjust the sound of the songs as per my taste. Sound of the 40 mm driver is great for listening music. My wife loves it.

For better concentration and masking noise around us while working when not on calls, one can play app in built sounds like rain, water fall, ocean etc. This is also a very nice feature that I like it.

Also, the app has got a feature to adjust the sound played on headset as per the listening capabilities of left and right hear. Isn't it a great thought by jabra and I appreciate it very much.

Battery life;
Yeah, other feature is a monstrous and excellent battery it has. It is now a week, still it is going on!! So, unlike other headphones, I do not have to put it to charge frequently and I am ao loving it!!!

Dual Pairing:
It very easily connected to my android mobile and windows 10 laptop over the bluetooth, no issues. It reconnects in a second when switched on.

Stability of the bluetooth 5.0 connection in jabra is great:

It does not drop off in between. Also, since it is wireless, I can walk easily within the home without any issues and I am enjoying it compared to my earlier wired headset. Also, compared to boat airpodes that I have, I found jabra has longer range , better stability and quality of the sound.

So, do I recommend? of course yes for the quality that I got in the price range during prime day launch."
6680,5.0,"I spend a close to 6-8 hours a day on calls. so, i was looking for a headphone that would allow me to ""walk and Talk"" so that i am not glued to the chair all though out the call. I got this headset for a deal. 5K. And for that price, this is a steal.
pros:
1) Battery backup is really awesome and lives up the promise. 50hrs. I have not timed it exactly, but if i charge it once on monday, it lasts for me the entire week.
2) connects to two devices concurrently. Helps me take calls from both my laptop and mobile.
3) call quality is good. the folks on other end didnt complain once about low/disrupted voice or ambient noises. i could stay away from the device almost 15-20 feet and was still able to listen/talk
4) The weight of the headphone is a acquired taste :). After a week of usage, feels light, does not pain the ears and can be used for long duration as well.
5) the sound does not bleed much unless you are on full volume. But dont expect noise cancellation. This is not built for that.

Cons
1) music quality is ok. as mentioned by others, this is not for audiophiles. This is purely a work-related headphone with primary usecase as calls. being able to listen to music or watch a movie is purely add on.
2) I felt a good amount of heat on my ears during the first few days. i was afraid the sweat would damage the ear muffs. So, i wrapped it in a sock ;).
3) when it reaches low battery, the headphone some times does not connect automatically.. some times it drops the calls. Not really that painful as charging it to full takes less than an hour. But definitely a pain point.

overall, its a steal, for the price i bought it."
6681,5.0,"This is the best headphone in every aspect. I have used Jabra evolve 65 which comes with a usb receiver too(INR 29000). But this way better than that and at almost ⅕th of the price.

Pros:
Awesome battery life 6-7 of daily usage (4-5 hrs office calls, 1-2 hrs of YouTube/online streaming plus another couple of hours of music. Battery will easily get you 4 to 5 days. Just forget charging! Also it has usb c fast charging..I was able to full charge in almost 30 minutes.

Connectivity wise it has BT 5.0 which enables it to connect it to 2 devices seamlessly. I never had Issues with connectivity. You can play pause audio video on laptop/phone simultaneously and there is no need to disconnect the headset from your device. You will have complete control of the connectivity and switch connections at your will.

Design is pretty minimalistic..earcups comes with comfortable memory foam, all control buttons are on the right side. The headset is quite durable while being very flexible. And quite comfortable for long hours of usage.

Music is a blissful experience with this headphones. For listening to songs via mobile always use the Jabra sound plus app..it is a very intuitive app where you can customize your hearing according to your choice..This is not bass heavy headphones but the bass is very much balanced..you can say the bass is not too much where other vocals lows and instruments sound are reduced..you will have a very good combination of low mids and high and other acoustic sounds. I have tweaked a few Equalizer settings in Amazon prime music app and Wynk Music and the sound output is just fabulous.While listening to music or watching movies on pc, to have a good audio experience please use the stereo mode for Jabra headset in the audio settings.

Range is very good..I tested MS teams call while I was away from my laptop and standing almost 15 to 17 feet away and beneath a wall. I still did not have any call quality drop issue.

Calls are crystal clear..I have tried Zoom meeting, WebEx call as well as MS teams call and all works very well without any flaws..Call reception and quality is also good over mobile calls. Also it does not have the weird mouthpiece but call quality is very good because of dual microphones.

Cons

The could have given a sturdy case to carry the headset but that's not a deal breaker..

Lastly this headphones is listed for 9999 INR But I got it less than 6000 INR thanks to a deal plus coupon provided by Amazon..

Hope this helps!"
6682,1.0,"I don't think one would buy this for its sound quality, which one would, if one were generous, classify as ""better than average"". The ""Wish You Were Here"" album sounded just a bit odd.

Having said that, it's very light, comfortable and has a claimed long battery life. Pairing with two devices is useful (phone and media player or laptop). Switching between them is smooth and intuitive. Setup and registration took less than three minutes.

However, when connected to two devices (a phone and other device), there is constant interruption of audio when operating the phone which transmits touch sounds etc... irritating. Another irritant is the voice being played back on the headphone, but it is configurable and can be completely switched off. Phone calls are odd sounding too, but I think one has to get used to the sound and overall operation.

The equalizer is very good, and the location feature is useful, I guess. The ""MySound"" feature appears useful, but only extended use will reveal it's utility. There is a ""Soundscape"" feature, for playing white noise, etc. over the headset.

I couldn't get the ""voice assistant"" to work, maybe it will work after some fiddling.

Overall, it would be a fine headphone for around ₹ 4000/-, not more.

UPDATE: The headband is very weird looking when worn, and NOT in a cute way. i.e., it's UGLY. This one single factor must dissuade potential buyers from buying these headphones. Should have known, it being ""Designed in Denmark"" and all /s!

UPDATE II: The sound is good enough, after some fiddling with the settings. But an audiophile would probably say the sound is ""slightly muddy"".

UPDATE III: The user manual in the mobile app is very good, and useful.

UPDATE IV: For some reason, (phone) call gets put on hold after around 10 minutes on a call. Don't know if this is specific to my setup.

UPDATE V: Many functions like pause or mute don't work with Microsoft Windows 10 or YouTube. I also wish there was a dedicated mute button."
6683,4.0,"I was looking for a mid range Wireless On-Ear Headphone with Mic. Wanted to spend the money on a reputable brand, so, Jabra was a real contender.
I purchased this product in the Prime Day Sale at INR 5999. At this time there were not may reviews available for this product. I own a Jabra Elite Active 65t. So, had a fair bit of idea how it's going to be. All the controls are in the right ear cup. Sound Up-Down/Next-Previous Songs, Play/Pause/Receive or End Calls, Mute has a dedicated button. Dedicated button for On-Off-Pair
After using this for around 3 days here are my thoughts.

Battery Life: Excellent. I have used this for almost 11 hours. And I still have 78% battery left.
Sound Quality: Average. I am not an Audiophile, but I know my sound signature. The Low and Mid tones are very crisp and clear. This headphones suffer in the High and Bass. The Bass is very low. So,if you are a Bass Head, keep away from this.
Mic: Good. The Mic is good. I took calls in Phone (both iPhone and Android) and also connected via Laptop (Teams, Skype) no issues till now. The other party did not complain of a low voice or noise.
Comfort: Average. The Ear cups are good size, fits fine. The clamping force will be a little tight for a couple of days but, eventually settles in. The Headband is soft and comfortable. One big miss is adjustable headband. Come on Jabra, that is a basic feature. How can you miss this. Yes, the headband is not adjustable. It's fixed. You cannot adjust it.
Build Quality: Good. Typical Jabra style. Sturdy but, not metal strong but good quality plastic.

P.S. It connects via Jabra Sound+ App on Mobile, where it asks you to set-up your sound profile. I found it to be a gimmick. The only advantage I found is you can set Sidetone, where you can enable how much you want to hear in your own voice during use. The other typical uses in the app are see the battery percentage, set tones during mute, Sleep Mode etc. There is no app available for Windows 10"
6684,4.0,"I cam accross jabra for the ist time at my office. The office wired hesdphome wss super comfortable. Hence I always wanted to buy one. Its been 3 days i have been using this product.

Pros: Comfort is number 1. For me its top priority since I really like to listen to songs at a stretch for 3 4 hrs while working. In tat sspect 5/5. Really comfortable. I have big ears so on ear headphones inclueing marshall creates lots of pain for me. This ones just like a breeze on ur ear. The headband also has a good cushion.
Durability: top notch. I have used fragile headphones before and this ones not.
Sound: Now comming to sound I am no audiophile but when I compare against Seinheisser Cx earphones the notes are very flat here. Bass is flat. Voices are crystal and EDMs sound okayish. But I am not sure if the 6000 rs mark can buy u premium sound as well premium comfort. Might be skullcandy crusher or marshalls no doubt will have better slund than this. But if you are like me who wants decent sound I think it works fine.
Call quality: Pretty good. Little bit of echo but good microphone and pretty clear voice.
Connectivity: TERRIBLE. I have an iphone and an ipad along with bluetooth smart tv. Connectivity is a big issue. On apple products every time u reconnect u need to search for the jabra product.
Blue tooth range: Excellent. Since its bkuetooth 5 hence really good range. I mean too good.
Charging: Out of the world. You charge once and seriously guys for one whole week you wint need to charge. Its something exceptional this bramd has achieved.
Noise cancellation: Poor.
So overall a good buy but in this price range I think u can either get comfort or premium sound. If you are an WFH guy like me who wants a comfortable headphone with lomg hours of calls and okayish sound. Go for it."
6685,3.0,"The headphones have amazing battery life. Even after 2 years of usage, I am able to use them on a single charge for the entire work week. The sound quality is good as well. You might have to install the Sound+ app so that you can control the sound quality better.
It works well with 2 devices at a time."
6686,5.0,"The headphones just superb. These are my go-to headphones for work now. Pros & Cons below

Pros:
- Pairs with two devices at once and seemlessly switches between.
- Pretty comfortable to wear for long hours. Really soft cushions and an interesting design.
- A real battery monster. It lives up to the claim of 45 hours. Charge it once and it takes you through a week of heavy usage.
- Microphone quality is simply outstanding. Trust me, I've tried out a lot of different headphones over years and this one doesn't let you down. The other side could hear you loud and clear.
- USB Type C with fast charging is a cherry om top.

Cons:
- I'm a bit concerned about earcup replacement. I sweat a lot and the earcups are gonna wear out eventually. I couldn't find any replacement earcups and wonder what happens if I can't get replacement earcups.
- The microphone is too sensitive at times that it picks birds chirping out the window, but as I see it, that's more a sweet problem :)

Pls do drop a like if this review helps."
6687,3.0,"I have used this for more than 3 months now.

Pros:
- Good Sound quality for Movies and Music
- Battery life is excellent. Charge and forget for a week, even with continuous calls for the day.
- Soft speaker cushions, for long use may be upto 2 hours, beyond that it feel pressed against your ears

Cons:
- Not good for calls. The other person keep complaining about audio quality
- bluetooth connectivity keep dropping
- When connected to 2 devices, if you get some call on one and they try to play the audio on your computer, its kind of act weird.

For this Money, Jabra should have put better mic to cover the calling issue. Sound is too feable for the other side and people started asking me to throw off the head phone (I bought it with hard earned money so not throwing off) Just that its good for the movies etc, I am still using, but not helping with my regular calls unfortunately

So if you are planning to buy this just to listen to music and Movies and hardly few calls, Its a good buy. But if you need to kind of use it for office purpose, not recommended."
6688,4.0,"I bought this headphone specifically for office con-calls. The build is good, nice look and feel, soft earcups, and good battery life that enables us to wade through long calls with ease - but only if we are lucky enough to connect successfully to Zoom, MS Teams, Meet, or Skype which itself is a task! I use MacBook Air for con-calls and after more than one month of use, here is my feedback:
1. There were instances when other participants muted me because of the loud ""krrrr"" noise when I try to join the meeting.
2. Zoom and Skype doesn't recognize the headphones easily and even if everything seems to be okay when testing the mic and speakers, the headphone has let me down many times when I actually try to connect before the start of the meeting. Because of this, I was forced to keep a wired headphone (small ones that are used in phones) always by my side. The pathetic thing to have after spending 6K for a headphone!
3. Call switching doesn't always work smoothly between mobile and laptop.
4. We need to download the Jabra Sound+ app and can customize the headphone experience, which I think is good.
5. If we are fortunate to get connected to calls without any glitches, the headphone works well. The mic is good (I did a lot of testing with my friends) and the audio is pretty clear.
6. Charging works fast, which is a plus
7. The headphone is a bit heavy and the fit is not snug. There is a chance of headphones falling off when you bend unknowingly.
Overall, I feel this is not a good buy at this price point. This is priced at 10K on the Jabra India website. Lots of negatives and, surprisingly, a global company like Jabra hasn't paid any attention to usability aspects while designing these headphones."
6689,5.0,"To be frank I was worried with the reviews pepl had given on the supplier ( defect product was sent , damaged etc etc)
But I got brand new Jabra Elite 45H headset
Thanks to the Vendor

It’s my first experience with Jabra product and also review is based on first day usage
1. Pairing and registering the warranty was easy and well guided instructions
2. Jabra sound + app helps to test the headset quality with multiple sounds frequency tat will ensure device quality or defected
3. I took zoom and teams call for 4 hrs which was perfectly good and no complaints from the other participants on voice or noise quality
4. Jabra sound + app helps you to set and modify your audio quality
5. I had paired my IPhone and Laptop I could switch between these for calls and music in phone no issue faced
6. Leather quality is good doesn’t hurt your ears even though you r on long calls

Worth for money, in this price rage can’t expect more 😊
This feedback is based on day one usage
Will share feedback after few weeks
Thanks to Amazon and Vendor"
6690,1.0,"I also have Sony wh-1000xm4, and trust me Jabra elite 45h are even better than Sony.
I bought it in 7k and I am fully satisfied with the product.
Sound quality is just awesome.
Bass is so natural and thumpy.
You will may not like sound out of the box, Once you download jabra sound+ app, there you can adjust EQ.
Toggle switch to turn on/off is super handy and comfortable in day to day use, I don't know why other brands are using 3 sec press for turning on/off.
I daily use it for MS teams calls for office purposes and for listening to songs also, in both they perform exceptionally well.
I would say Its a one stop shop for all your headphone requirements.
Battery backup is also very nice, I charge it in around 15-20 days and I use it daily.

Conclusion: 100% Recommended."
6691,4.0,"Build quality: it has good build quality. Feels solid robust.

Sound quality: sound quality is average there is no bass. I would say this are meant particularly for calling.

Noise cancellation: very good noise cancellation. I have been using this for my office call on zoom and it reduces the noise quite well and the person listening on the other end will hear your voice crisp clear. But if the other person talking in the same room or playing video then it does reduce the noise but not completely and the other person will be able to hear some of the noise.

Battery life: it’s battery life is amazing. And also it has usb-c type port and supports fast charging.

Overall I liked the product after testing other products like Logitech h600, boult and zebronics."
6692,3.0,This headphone is designed and curated for working professional who are having continuously calls over teams and zoom. Best for meetings and office use
6693,1.0,"I am writing this review after a week of continuous use. My primary need was to buy a headphones for meetings and office work. Based on the reviews and description, Jabra elite 45h seemed to fit the bill very well. Here is my experience after using this headset.
Pros
1) Bluetooth works well. Ability to connect to my laptop and my phone at the same time.
2) Sound volume is good.
3) The dedicated mute button is good for people who are on meetings and conf calls.
4) Battery backup is good. I charged it fully when i started using, and 7 days later i still have a good amount of battery remaining.
5) Call quality is excellent. Noise cancellation seems to be working very well too.
6) C-type USB charging is convenient as most mobile phones nowadays are switching to this style.
Cons
1) The memory foam cushion is not sufficient (at least in my case). After using for about an hour, the plastic inside the ear cups start pressing against my ear lobs causing pain.
2) It is not breathable, so I need to adjust the ear cups every now and then to allow air circulation.
3) Sound quality is not good for listening to songs. Audiophiles may have to look elsewhere.
4) The material looks superior, but feels cheap on your hands.
5) No 3.5mm jack for wired connection (just an observation, in case someone expects both wired and wireless connection)
6) For some reason, my laptop paired immediately with the device, but on my mobile phone I had to install the Jabra software in order to pair the headset. Not sure if it is the case for everyone though.
Hope this helps you make a decision.
Edit - 10-Feb-2022
After using this for around 10 months, the ear cushions have developed a rip (see attached photo). You do not expect the cushions to fail so soon on a premium product. Knocking off one star for this."
6694,4.0,"Initial feedback after 1 hour usage.

1. Sound quality for video: Works quite well
2. Sound quality for incoming phone calls: works quite well
3. Outgoing voice quality: no complaints from audience on other side except for some background noise since the mic is near neck so it picks up all sounds in addition to speaker's voice
4. Echo: I can hear my own voice which admittedly is annoying but nothing that I can't live with

*****************
I am yet to start testing for actual purpose I brought this headphones for: Skype and MS Teams calls. Expect to update this section after a thorough testing of conference calls.

Edit: I was able to test headset for Skype and Teams call over 2 days.
Teams: very intermittent connectivity. Sound to other end is like that in a theater or Cinema hall and not useful for business calls without upsetting people. Always have to keep a spare headset which beats the purpose of a wireless headset.

Skype: worked well.

Verdict: this is not useful (for me) in long run as Skype is transitioning to Teams here and as such not of use to me. Such a pity as these are quite comfortable and the best battery life so far (still 90%) after so much testing."
6695,3.0,"I have been using this headphone mostly for conference calls and attending remote meetings. Used it with Google meets and zoom calls. I am giving it two stars based on my experiences below:
Pros:
1. The voice quality received on the other end is good and clear.
2. The audio quality of the other end is clear to me.
3. Bluetooth range is amazing, many time I move across the rooms and I can still hear the sound even I am around 15 to 20 feet away from my laptop.
4. It has a mute button which helps a lot.

Cons:
1. Initially as per the default setting there was a playback of my voice to me. I was able to control it via Settings in Jaba app and fix it.
2. The biggest problem with the head set is sometimes it gives a vibrating noise which makes it difficult to understand what other person is saying. It becomes annoying and I have to disconnect and reconnect the Bluetooth. Felt like there is some noise coming along with the audio from other end.
Due to this even if other points are good I generally avoid using this headset for an important calls and use a wired one. I am unable to fix it via any setting in Jabra app

This annoying vibration and rattling noise is the main reason I won’t recommend this headset for conference calls and meetings. It would be a good purchase if you just want to listen to music via Bluetooth from phone or laptop.

Recently I used Jabra app to raise support query to get this issue fixed but have not received any response from their customer care."
6696,5.0,"Hi, product build quality is good and easy to pair with laptop and mobile.

Only concern is over priced. After I bought I see that it’s coming at 4500 only."
6697,5.0,"Look and feel is great, sound quality was good. But the connectivity was not seamless. The headphones were not able to connect to other devices. I was able to connect to one device , but to other devices like laptop and Phone the headphones did not appear as headphones during the scan and also not able to connect at all. This initial experience led me to return the product."
6698,5.0,"Good Product, it’s my first over the head headphones and I use Jabra products in Office so was my expectations were met, Primarily bought these for work from home needs and wanted a good headphone where I can take calls effortlessly , sound quality is amazing, Call quality is crisp and clear , only drawback is that you cannot use them for an extended period of time, I used them for couple of hours straight and had pain in my ears, you also have to do multiple adjustments to find a sweet spot where they won’t fall off , earlier used to slip off my head , overall I am happy with the purchase , got them on offer plus cash back for 5.5K , wish there was a noise cancellation feature but then you have to spend more if you require everything on a nice pair of headphones 😊"
6699,5.0,Very useful for taking calls and compatible with windows. Only one issue is that the teams call cannot be muted unmuted using the button
6700,3.0,"Received product within a day. I bought this for work from home. It works well for calls in Skype and teams. Microphone works well as good as a wired one. Don't buy cheap wireless headphones as all of them have poor mike. Something like this should be bought.
No noise cancellation as described in product. In fact you will hear nearby sounds in a different way as of it is coming from other side.

It has voice assistant and volume buttons. Mute button as well. But mute button sync with skype or teams is not reliable, sometimes doesn't work as expected

Connectivity and range is very good.

Battery life is awesome. Comes for a week atleast."
6701,1.0,"The best you can get for the price. In my hunt for good quality wireless headphones due to work from home I researched a lot products with a decent price. Few points were the must for me-
1. Battery Life
2. Multi Point Bluetooth Connectivity
3. Comfortable for long hours
4. Voice clarity at the other end

Surprising this headphone is outstanding in all above points including music quality.
The battery life is enormous 50 hours is what is stated and I feel it’s that only. Multipoint connectivity is a boon. Comfort is amazing I’ve used it for entire day on training and no discomfort at all. I’ve a sennheiser HD420 and apple air pods as well however the music quality of this headphone is so good that I rarely use them now. You may not get that punchy bass but music is not all about bass only. Having dual microphone the voice clarity at other end is amazing. Personalised sound is the cherry on top.
Final verdict- for 5000₹ you don’t have a better choice. Go for it without a second thought."
6702,4.0,"I am not able to pair this with my Windows 10, not sure how to pair? Can anybody help me with?"
6703,5.0,"First impressions, look is good, feels sturdy, built is of good quality plastic, padding is soft can wear for long time but not if you have large ears. Sound quality is very good and can be optimised my the jabra app which makes the sound more better. Feels light on head. Given 4 star as I have large ears so it hurts a little bit on my left ear. Lows are good, vocals are damm clear, instrument separation is good. High and mids are good but can be better with the app as it optimise according to your hearing."
6704,3.0,"Review after continuous usage (for 4 to 6 hours of meetings in Teams ) after a month:

I purchased the item on a discounted price of ~5999.

Battery life is the one good feature you can totally rely on.

Connectivity: Random disconnections... not sure when and why.... atleast once in a day usage.

Audio quality: this is the fundamental feature of any head set. Unfortunately, Jabra failed to provide a basic feature working properly for a device. At the beginning of the call, audio quality is fine, you can hear others clearly. After 10 to 15 mins, you hear audio click-click sound continuously along with others voice. This really irritates the usage.

Noise cancellation: As this is not a feature committed with this product, no expectations.

Headset Fit: If you wear it for longer duration like more than 1 hour, you will start feeling the pain of ears are tightly pressed. I guess Jabra tried to keep it tight to supress external noise coming to your ears. But, at the end , main purpose of headset usage is gone... You can not use it for continuous meetings.

Conclusion: dont plan it for any continuous usage. Not useful of office meetings. Better try with other products that comes for same or better price that serves the clear purpose as a Headset."
6705,5.0,"Product is good but, original packaging was cut open and there were additional tapes on the products authentic ones. The tape on top of the buttons on the headphones were also dirty and full or finger prints. Awful experience selling used products for such expensive headphones. Cannot return because I need to use it urgently."
6706,5.0,"This headphone fit to all your requirement. Pros. You need a headphone for office calls✔️ you need a headphone for casual calls✔️ you need a headohone for music✔️ the sound quality and base is bang on. Switching between your mobile and laptop is smooth. They have two microphone which lets you heard to the other end cisp clear. Bluetooth range is better than any other brand. And battery life is oomph, I sometime forget the it needs to be charged also. For me it comes for about a week post full charge with office calls, personal calls and listening to music.
Cons. Fit is lose for indian average head. And jabra should work on this because they have a beutiful product but when it comes to fit it loses there."
6707,5.0,"My first Jabra purchase and surely it worth it, spl getting under decent discount, product is fresh Sep2020, Headphones are very comfortable and lightweight, plush material soft on you ears, Jabra App is intuitive and feature rich. I was able to connect it with my phone, smart TV seamlessly , though it took some effort to get it connect it with my windows 10 Dell PC.

Since it does not cover full ears there is some sound leak, button are bit difficult to get use to but certainly its not deal breaker."
6708,4.0,"Top product - it may be a slight disappointment if you are looking for a bass-heavy experience. However, if your main use-case is to take work calls, it works really well - decent mike and a comfortable wearing experience. It looks really nice too. Strongly recommend!"
6709,1.0,"I ordered 45h two days back (on 16 Nov) for INR 5499/- and received it this morning (18 Nov). I connected it to my laptop as we all as mobile and can tell you it works like a gem with both the devices (yes it is paired and connected to both the devices at the same time).

I bought this piece primarily for Teams calls (plus for a bit of personal use - music, movies). I can tell you that microphones are superb and really good for office purposes. I am not avid music buff so do not how to do a technical review here. However, trust me this piece works great as a normal headphone plus something that you rely on for your calls/meetings!

If you are looking for quality headphones at a decent price, then your search ends here!!! Please try to get it for ~5500 INR or less. Thanks!"
6710,1.0,"I bought it for my Son (9th STD) and daughter (5th STD). Very good for kids learning if you get it for Rs. 5000,like I did. Not worth more, as these do not have Boom mics (external mics). But very good for online school, while in dance and yoga sessions for kids..."
6711,4.0,"Best deal got it for 5399 with instant has back for hdfc on prime sale ( MRP on box is 9999 and was not available in Jabra online store)
Pro:
Jabar sound+ app to create profile and you can set your preference deep base, smoot and customise too .
Can pair up to 8 device and last 2 devices is connected simultaneously. So when ur watching some in laptop and if you get call on mobile it when you attend call it connects to your headphones automatically and switch to laptop when call get disconnected.
Call quality is awesome. No external noise. You can set audio feed back if u like. ( you can hear how you soud on call it like echo feeback )
Came with 50% charge and it took less that 45 min to get charge fully.
Comfortable to wear I didn't feel any discomfort while wearing continuously for more that 6hr

While pairing to phone or laptop it took time to connect compare to my OnePlus z or JBL bluetooth esrphones.

Will update after few months if any cons."
6712,4.0,I bought it for work from home use and it's pretty good for that. Sound quality is good. only i wish it has adjustable head band that would have been great.
6713,5.0,"I mainly bought this to use it with Teams. There are only very few BT headphones which works seamlessly over BT for win 10 and this would be one of them. Bought for 5K on offer.
Pros:
1. Seamless BT connectivity and really recommended for MS Teams / Mobile calls. Clear call audio
2. Very comfortable earpads ideal for long hour
3. Amazing Battery life. Daily I use to be in calls for about 3-4 hours and after 4 days still I have 40% battery left
4. Fast charging especially on Wall charger
5. Premium Build quality and matte finishing looks beautiful.
Cons:
1. Average for music listening / audiophiles
2. Though audio is crystal clear, you have keep it min 80% volume.
3. Volume could have been better
4. Too much of sound leakage.
5. Avg Noise isolation. Can still take calls with loud ceiling fan above."
6714,4.0,"I bought this headphone for my WFH purpose. It connects easily to 2 laptops which is my true requirement for going for this model. This headset is the most comfortable onear headset ever made and you will love it outright. There is passive noise cancellation and it's enough for my purposes. The beauty of this headphone though comes out of the Jabra Sound+ app. Once you have personalized it with your phone it sounds like a completely different device. This is simply awesome especially for music lovers. 50h battery life is something unheard of and still after a week of usage, the battery is going strong. Maybe once a month charging is enough for a heavy user like me. Should you buy this headphone? Absolutely yes unless you have a real good reason to break the bank for an active noise cancellation headphone."
6715,4.0,"Perfect headset for long calls during work from home. For Teams and Zoom calls, members on the calls told me that they do not have background noise. They do not hear anything apart from my voice or other human voice. I am not sure if this is Teams feature or this headset's feature.

Music output is good. Checked Amazon music and Apple music. Connects to my phone and Mac seamlessly. Windows 10 connection is good too.

I particularly like the option of hearing my own voice on calls, this ensures I am not too loud and I also know how I sound on calls."
6716,5.0,"It is essentially same as Evolve 2 65. It does not have the dedicated mouthpiece and it is not compatible with the jabra PC app. BUt here are the advantages of Elite 45H:
1. It has larger battery life (50 hrs)
2. It is exactly same performance as Evolve 2 65 in terms of sound quality
3. If you are not talking from a train station, the two microphone does enough. (Evolve 2 65 has 3)
4. It is comfortable enough to handle phone calls and occasional listening.
5. it works fine 20-25ft away with 2 walls in between. Even Apple Earpod pros stutter.

Here are the problems:

1. It has less wireless range (33 ft)
2. Maybe.......Maybe... talking with a ceiling fan running may cause some wind noise... because of 2 microphone design, but I have not tested it."
6717,5.0,"Amazon delivery was safe and well done. Product in itself was packed very well.
I went through reviews almost everywhere before converting my allegiance from Sony, had terrible experience whenever I tried other brands. Jabra - unfortunately I never heard of it until I saw them being used in current Outsourcing setups. Gave this one a try and boy it lived up to its billing.

Mids are alright, not those headphones for watching movies or listening to songs for hours. Its strength is on answering calls and listening to voices it's strength shows. For long hours of work this will stay cool as cucumber and lives long enough for couple of days.

Bluetooth is brilliant, The mobile app is a must and helps plenty customizing the headset to your needs."
6718,3.0,"This is one of the best headphones in the market at this price, especially if taking calls is also your priority. Its highlights are excellent mic and battery life! Here are my feedbacks:

Pros:
1. One of the best mic and sound quality offered during calls. If you are looking for a suitable wireless headphone that has decent noise cancellation and high call quality, this one is surely a choice. Provides pretty impressive audio quality too (Being a casual listener, I have felt the quality is good enough)
2. Very good battery capacity. I have used it for hours attending calls, listening to videos and songs, only to be charged hardly once a week! I turn it off when not in use, but this will also go to auto-sleep mode which can be configured through the app.
3. App based control and settings which makes it easier to set up and customize your personalized sound effects.

Cons:
1. Not suitable to be used while running or during work outs. This one fits perfectly for me but not enough to stay tight during workouts. This might obviously depend on the head size."
6719,5.0,Product was good sound quality as per the expectations
6720,4.0,"One of the best features I liked about these headphones is the customizability of the various sound aspects through the app. For example, I don't like the sidetone feature, so I just turned it off, a feature which is not customizable in most of the headphones. I can also increase/decrease the bass depending on my mood.
The battery backup is also extraordinary, one of the best.
Needless to say and pointed out by many others too: perfect for meetings as well.
This is an extremely worthy product for it's price."
6721,4.0,"My review is after 2 months of intense use. First of all, it is regrettable that this product is not well received inspite of offering so many features at a reasonable cost. So just as an happy customer of this product, I want to do some justice by writing a honest & a practical review of this product. Definitely this product deserves a better treatment.
Also I wanted to clarify certain features of this product which is misunderstood as a defect/ not existing.

For many years I was very uncomfortable using wired headphone as the wires get tangled & can't stretch or move away from laptop.But still I kept myself away from a bluetooth headphone because of the following reasons:
1.Battery capacity is vey less & it has to be charged frequently & for long hours incase of exhausted battery
2.Mic is not good for mobile voice calls
3.Very uncomfortable & painful after 2-3 hours of use (From the reviews for most of the very good brands)
4.Not very much compatible with office meeting softwares like Skype/Webex
5.Connecting single wireless headphone for both mobile & laptop is not that simple
6.Bluetooth connectivity not seamless
7.Range not good
8.Sound quality is not that great compared to wired

Now that I work from home for the past 6 months, there is a greater unavoidable need for me to use phone & laptop alternatively/simultaneously for all my voice interactions with the team for extended hours. Also working from home made me to listen to music quite often ( which was not the case before) .
All these forced needs, made me to lookout for a wireles headphone with
1.Multi device connectivity & ability to switch
between the devices easily
2.High battery capacity & Fast charging
3.Good mic for voice calls on mobile/laptop
4.Compatibility with Skype/Webex calls
5.Comfort for long hours
6.Seamless Bluetooth connectivity
7.Better Bluetooth range
8.Good sound signature
9.Last but not least , affordable

I found Jabra Elite 45H as the best fit for all my above expectations. I'm really happy to have bought this product.

Some highlights of the product from my personal experience (Android 10 Phone, Dell Business Laptop with Win 10, Skype , WebEx ):
. Bluetooth 5.0 - Quick & uninterrupted connection. I
could listen to the music when the
connected headphone & the mobile(Bluetooth 5.0)
are in different floors.
. Doesn't support AptxHD
. 40 mm Drivers - 24 bit Audio sounds great.Bass is
little soft compared to what I expected. But
for long hours usage , it is good to have soft bass.
. 50 Hours battery - 15 min. of quick charge gives
10 hrs & Charges 100% in 90 minutes.
. No 3.5mm jack . Can't be used in wiredmode.
. 2 mics- Good Indoor call quality
. Sleepmode time adjustment saves battery well
. Voice Assistants - Works very well when connected
to phone only.
. Voice based notification.Ex: Battery , Connected.
. Soundscapes ( preloaded sounds like bird songs,
rainy day, waterfall, caverns etc).I like it.
. Memory foam as earcushion- Soft. I could use it
continuously for 6-7 hrs daily.
. Lightweight.
. Firmware update through App.Did an update.
. 2 yr warranty against rain and dust
. Good looking Copper Black

Some reflections on other's review comments:
1. "" I hear voice echo""- It's not a defect. It's a feature
to listen to our own voice to know what other's
will hear.It can be disabled through the app.
2.""Headband is not adjustable""- I'm not sure if I
misunderstood the statement.Headband is
actually adjustable i.e you can pull/extend the
earpad to suit your head profile.
3.""Headband is loose""- It might not be a good fit for
small head profiles.
4.""Sound bleeds""- As it doesn't have Active Noise
Cancellation, it doesn't provide complete
insulation from surrounding sounds.
5. ""It doesn't connect to my laptop without
Bluetooth. It's a waste. "" - Please buy a Bluetooth
adapter from TP link to use such headphones. It's
not the fault of the product.

I've just shared my expectations vs experiences for this product. If your requirement is similar, this is definitely a great product to look for. Well done Jabra !!!"
6722,5.0,"Great headphones with nice cancellation mic, person on the other side cannot hear any noice even if you are in a traffic. But it captures if anyone speaks in background. Good for calls and meetings, just a decent one for music and bass."
6723,5.0,Although it's light in weight but grip is bit tight even after extending full which makes it bit u comfortable after wearing 15 mins.
6724,5.0,"I bought this pair in October 2020 and have been using this regularly. I use this product for work. Here is my long term review.

Pros:
1. Battery life is amazing. I can go through my entire work week without needing to charge these. That is about 6-7 hours of calls every day. And the battery performance has not deteriorated over time.
2. Call quality is good. The mics do a great job focusing on my voice and drowning out other sounds.
3. The headphones sound good to me. I am not an audiophile, though.
4. Does not have ANC, but the on the ear design does a decent job blocking out most external noise.
5. Decent bluetooth range.

Cons:
1. The biggest issue I am having is with the build quality. It hasn't been 2 years yet and the cushioning on the right ear is disintegrating (pics attached). Had definitely expected this product to last longer
2. Some minor glitches when switching between conferencing apps. Sometimes the mic stops working when I switch from a Zoom call to a Google Meet. Starts working when you switch off and on.
3. Have also faced some issues with the mute button while using Google Meet. Instead of muting me on the call, the button seems to mute me in windows. Have to unmute from the system sound settings. Not a pleasant experience when in a call.

Overall, this is a decent product. Value for money at 5.5k mark. But if you are a moderate to heavy user, do not expect to get more than 2 years out of these."
6725,4.0,"Good for Meeting, calls & music. After lot of research finally got it. Loved the product
Active Noise cancellation is not there, not recommended for Gym or sports"
6726,4.0,"Have been using it for more than 1 year. Bought it specifically for attending work calls and this didn't disappoint me at all. I was surprised by how clear my voice sounds to others in the meeting.
Sound quality noise cancellation are pretty decent.
It's easy on the ears and very comfortable. Only con is that the outer earphones layer which touches the ears tears off after an year of usage."
6727,5.0,"Like most people I was really really confused on getting a great headphones for work purpose. I kept hearing from people that they have spent 20-30 grand. I am writing this review after 3 months of daily usage.

And finally after days of searching I stumbled upon this product from Jabra. I was apprehensive but since i had to get one soon, I went for it. And boy, did I make the right decision..!

The biggest pro is the battery life. I recharge it like once every 5-8 days. I have calls for 3 hours daily.

The voice clarity is great. The other person can hear me crystal clear and I can hear them great too. My home environment is not noisy so the audio is quite clear. So I cannot comment on the Noise cancellation quality. I use it for Skype, Teams and Zoom meetings and works well on all these apps.

Music seems to be quite fine from it. I'm not too much into music so I'm not sure the exact requirements what a music head would want from a headset. But it serves the purpose and I'm happy about it.

The only con is- Mute button doesn't seem to work during calls. Works for music.

All in all a superb buy stuff you will not regret it..

PRO TIP:
1. During 1 meeting, the other person mentioned that the audio is quite unclear and bad. I was baffled. I turned it off and used my old headset for the rest of the day. The next day I turned this one ON and to my surprise it started working just fine. This is one off incident.

2. You can download the app and customise the audio as per your wish. There will be an echo when you speak and this is called as Sidetone. This happens so that you are aware of the volume of your speech that the other person hears. You can disable it once you are comfortable with your audio volume."
6728,5.0,"First , the good things:

1. the bluetooth connectivity is good. the device connects both to my phone and laptop and switches between them seamlessly.
2. the app is good - helps in settings, help , user guide etc..
3. build quality so far and the packaging is fine. Although its a new device for me.

However I will focus on cons more because I am not happy with the device.

1. Mic quality is bad. On phone, the other person finds the voice muffled. On ms teams also, similar issue. Sometimes the voice is not even there with ms teams. I checked if my mic is on mute but that's not the case. finally I had no option but switch back to my laptop mic for calls.
2. audio ( speaker ) quality is also average. I used to hear a background noise earlier in the speaker when the call started. This sound would come only when the call is on. That sound went away after I made some changes in settings in the app ( turned side tone off). But otherwise also, the sound quality is only good for calls - there is a kind of brittleness in the sound. This is not a device for listening to music."
6729,4.0,"We get less mobile signal in our home and wifi calling is not available on my mobile. I get office calls on mobile and MS Teams/Skype/WebEx are used on laptop for calls. So, I was looking for a cost effective and excellent over the ear dual pairing wireless solution which can be used for music listening as well. I experienced Jabra Elite 45h had filled that gap very well and . Below is the review.

With Jabra Sound + App
Call Quality:

I can hear other persons voice very clearly and no one has any complaint of my voice. I have boat airpods and folks tell me that my voice sounds coming from distance, however with this jabra headset, there ia no auch complaints.

Since it is over the ear and has ambient noise reduction feature, it blocks outside sound and my own voice is heard very less during the call, so to have feedback of our own voice, it has sidetone feature, and I was able to adjust how loud my voice sounds to me in the call. Very very nice feature. It can be turned off as well if required.

Also, I was able to customize and hear the other persons voice to have more bass or treble or neutral while listening other person.

It also notifies in between if microphone is muted or unmute.

Sound quality and Music Experience:
With 5 band Music Equalizer and 6 different Music presets to adjust bass, treble and speech, I was able to adjust the sound of the songs as per my taste. Sound of the 40 mm driver is great for listening music. My wife loves it.

For better concentration and masking noise around us while working when not on calls, one can play app in built sounds like rain, water fall, ocean etc. This is also a very nice feature that I like it.

Also, the app has got a feature to adjust the sound played on headset as per the listening capabilities of left and right hear. Isn't it a great thought by jabra and I appreciate it very much.

Battery life;
Yeah, other feature is a monstrous and excellent battery it has. It is now a week, still it is going on!! So, unlike other headphones, I do not have to put it to charge frequently and I am ao loving it!!!

Dual Pairing:
It very easily connected to my android mobile and windows 10 laptop over the bluetooth, no issues. It reconnects in a second when switched on.

Stability of the bluetooth 5.0 connection in jabra is great:

It does not drop off in between. Also, since it is wireless, I can walk easily within the home without any issues and I am enjoying it compared to my earlier wired headset. Also, compared to boat airpodes that I have, I found jabra has longer range , better stability and quality of the sound.

So, do I recommend? of course yes for the quality that I got in the price range during prime day launch."
6730,2.0,"I spend a close to 6-8 hours a day on calls. so, i was looking for a headphone that would allow me to ""walk and Talk"" so that i am not glued to the chair all though out the call. I got this headset for a deal. 5K. And for that price, this is a steal.
pros:
1) Battery backup is really awesome and lives up the promise. 50hrs. I have not timed it exactly, but if i charge it once on monday, it lasts for me the entire week.
2) connects to two devices concurrently. Helps me take calls from both my laptop and mobile.
3) call quality is good. the folks on other end didnt complain once about low/disrupted voice or ambient noises. i could stay away from the device almost 15-20 feet and was still able to listen/talk
4) The weight of the headphone is a acquired taste :). After a week of usage, feels light, does not pain the ears and can be used for long duration as well.
5) the sound does not bleed much unless you are on full volume. But dont expect noise cancellation. This is not built for that.

Cons
1) music quality is ok. as mentioned by others, this is not for audiophiles. This is purely a work-related headphone with primary usecase as calls. being able to listen to music or watch a movie is purely add on.
2) I felt a good amount of heat on my ears during the first few days. i was afraid the sweat would damage the ear muffs. So, i wrapped it in a sock ;).
3) when it reaches low battery, the headphone some times does not connect automatically.. some times it drops the calls. Not really that painful as charging it to full takes less than an hour. But definitely a pain point.

overall, its a steal, for the price i bought it."
6731,5.0,"This is the best headphone in every aspect. I have used Jabra evolve 65 which comes with a usb receiver too(INR 29000). But this way better than that and at almost ⅕th of the price.

Pros:
Awesome battery life 6-7 of daily usage (4-5 hrs office calls, 1-2 hrs of YouTube/online streaming plus another couple of hours of music. Battery will easily get you 4 to 5 days. Just forget charging! Also it has usb c fast charging..I was able to full charge in almost 30 minutes.

Connectivity wise it has BT 5.0 which enables it to connect it to 2 devices seamlessly. I never had Issues with connectivity. You can play pause audio video on laptop/phone simultaneously and there is no need to disconnect the headset from your device. You will have complete control of the connectivity and switch connections at your will.

Design is pretty minimalistic..earcups comes with comfortable memory foam, all control buttons are on the right side. The headset is quite durable while being very flexible. And quite comfortable for long hours of usage.

Music is a blissful experience with this headphones. For listening to songs via mobile always use the Jabra sound plus app..it is a very intuitive app where you can customize your hearing according to your choice..This is not bass heavy headphones but the bass is very much balanced..you can say the bass is not too much where other vocals lows and instruments sound are reduced..you will have a very good combination of low mids and high and other acoustic sounds. I have tweaked a few Equalizer settings in Amazon prime music app and Wynk Music and the sound output is just fabulous.While listening to music or watching movies on pc, to have a good audio experience please use the stereo mode for Jabra headset in the audio settings.

Range is very good..I tested MS teams call while I was away from my laptop and standing almost 15 to 17 feet away and beneath a wall. I still did not have any call quality drop issue.

Calls are crystal clear..I have tried Zoom meeting, WebEx call as well as MS teams call and all works very well without any flaws..Call reception and quality is also good over mobile calls. Also it does not have the weird mouthpiece but call quality is very good because of dual microphones.

Cons

The could have given a sturdy case to carry the headset but that's not a deal breaker..

Lastly this headphones is listed for 9999 INR But I got it less than 6000 INR thanks to a deal plus coupon provided by Amazon..

Hope this helps!"
6732,4.0,"I don't think one would buy this for its sound quality, which one would, if one were generous, classify as ""better than average"". The ""Wish You Were Here"" album sounded just a bit odd.

Having said that, it's very light, comfortable and has a claimed long battery life. Pairing with two devices is useful (phone and media player or laptop). Switching between them is smooth and intuitive. Setup and registration took less than three minutes.

However, when connected to two devices (a phone and other device), there is constant interruption of audio when operating the phone which transmits touch sounds etc... irritating. Another irritant is the voice being played back on the headphone, but it is configurable and can be completely switched off. Phone calls are odd sounding too, but I think one has to get used to the sound and overall operation.

The equalizer is very good, and the location feature is useful, I guess. The ""MySound"" feature appears useful, but only extended use will reveal it's utility. There is a ""Soundscape"" feature, for playing white noise, etc. over the headset.

I couldn't get the ""voice assistant"" to work, maybe it will work after some fiddling.

Overall, it would be a fine headphone for around ₹ 4000/-, not more.

UPDATE: The headband is very weird looking when worn, and NOT in a cute way. i.e., it's UGLY. This one single factor must dissuade potential buyers from buying these headphones. Should have known, it being ""Designed in Denmark"" and all /s!

UPDATE II: The sound is good enough, after some fiddling with the settings. But an audiophile would probably say the sound is ""slightly muddy"".

UPDATE III: The user manual in the mobile app is very good, and useful.

UPDATE IV: For some reason, (phone) call gets put on hold after around 10 minutes on a call. Don't know if this is specific to my setup.

UPDATE V: Many functions like pause or mute don't work with Microsoft Windows 10 or YouTube. I also wish there was a dedicated mute button."
6733,5.0,"I was looking for a mid range Wireless On-Ear Headphone with Mic. Wanted to spend the money on a reputable brand, so, Jabra was a real contender.
I purchased this product in the Prime Day Sale at INR 5999. At this time there were not may reviews available for this product. I own a Jabra Elite Active 65t. So, had a fair bit of idea how it's going to be. All the controls are in the right ear cup. Sound Up-Down/Next-Previous Songs, Play/Pause/Receive or End Calls, Mute has a dedicated button. Dedicated button for On-Off-Pair
After using this for around 3 days here are my thoughts.

Battery Life: Excellent. I have used this for almost 11 hours. And I still have 78% battery left.
Sound Quality: Average. I am not an Audiophile, but I know my sound signature. The Low and Mid tones are very crisp and clear. This headphones suffer in the High and Bass. The Bass is very low. So,if you are a Bass Head, keep away from this.
Mic: Good. The Mic is good. I took calls in Phone (both iPhone and Android) and also connected via Laptop (Teams, Skype) no issues till now. The other party did not complain of a low voice or noise.
Comfort: Average. The Ear cups are good size, fits fine. The clamping force will be a little tight for a couple of days but, eventually settles in. The Headband is soft and comfortable. One big miss is adjustable headband. Come on Jabra, that is a basic feature. How can you miss this. Yes, the headband is not adjustable. It's fixed. You cannot adjust it.
Build Quality: Good. Typical Jabra style. Sturdy but, not metal strong but good quality plastic.

P.S. It connects via Jabra Sound+ App on Mobile, where it asks you to set-up your sound profile. I found it to be a gimmick. The only advantage I found is you can set Sidetone, where you can enable how much you want to hear in your own voice during use. The other typical uses in the app are see the battery percentage, set tones during mute, Sleep Mode etc. There is no app available for Windows 10"
6734,4.0,"I cam accross jabra for the ist time at my office. The office wired hesdphome wss super comfortable. Hence I always wanted to buy one. Its been 3 days i have been using this product.

Pros: Comfort is number 1. For me its top priority since I really like to listen to songs at a stretch for 3 4 hrs while working. In tat sspect 5/5. Really comfortable. I have big ears so on ear headphones inclueing marshall creates lots of pain for me. This ones just like a breeze on ur ear. The headband also has a good cushion.
Durability: top notch. I have used fragile headphones before and this ones not.
Sound: Now comming to sound I am no audiophile but when I compare against Seinheisser Cx earphones the notes are very flat here. Bass is flat. Voices are crystal and EDMs sound okayish. But I am not sure if the 6000 rs mark can buy u premium sound as well premium comfort. Might be skullcandy crusher or marshalls no doubt will have better slund than this. But if you are like me who wants decent sound I think it works fine.
Call quality: Pretty good. Little bit of echo but good microphone and pretty clear voice.
Connectivity: TERRIBLE. I have an iphone and an ipad along with bluetooth smart tv. Connectivity is a big issue. On apple products every time u reconnect u need to search for the jabra product.
Blue tooth range: Excellent. Since its bkuetooth 5 hence really good range. I mean too good.
Charging: Out of the world. You charge once and seriously guys for one whole week you wint need to charge. Its something exceptional this bramd has achieved.
Noise cancellation: Poor.
So overall a good buy but in this price range I think u can either get comfort or premium sound. If you are an WFH guy like me who wants a comfortable headphone with lomg hours of calls and okayish sound. Go for it."
6735,4.0,"The headphones have amazing battery life. Even after 2 years of usage, I am able to use them on a single charge for the entire work week. The sound quality is good as well. You might have to install the Sound+ app so that you can control the sound quality better.
It works well with 2 devices at a time."
6736,4.0,"The headphones just superb. These are my go-to headphones for work now. Pros & Cons below

Pros:
- Pairs with two devices at once and seemlessly switches between.
- Pretty comfortable to wear for long hours. Really soft cushions and an interesting design.
- A real battery monster. It lives up to the claim of 45 hours. Charge it once and it takes you through a week of heavy usage.
- Microphone quality is simply outstanding. Trust me, I've tried out a lot of different headphones over years and this one doesn't let you down. The other side could hear you loud and clear.
- USB Type C with fast charging is a cherry om top.

Cons:
- I'm a bit concerned about earcup replacement. I sweat a lot and the earcups are gonna wear out eventually. I couldn't find any replacement earcups and wonder what happens if I can't get replacement earcups.
- The microphone is too sensitive at times that it picks birds chirping out the window, but as I see it, that's more a sweet problem :)

Pls do drop a like if this review helps."
6737,5.0,"I have used this for more than 3 months now.

Pros:
- Good Sound quality for Movies and Music
- Battery life is excellent. Charge and forget for a week, even with continuous calls for the day.
- Soft speaker cushions, for long use may be upto 2 hours, beyond that it feel pressed against your ears

Cons:
- Not good for calls. The other person keep complaining about audio quality
- bluetooth connectivity keep dropping
- When connected to 2 devices, if you get some call on one and they try to play the audio on your computer, its kind of act weird.

For this Money, Jabra should have put better mic to cover the calling issue. Sound is too feable for the other side and people started asking me to throw off the head phone (I bought it with hard earned money so not throwing off) Just that its good for the movies etc, I am still using, but not helping with my regular calls unfortunately

So if you are planning to buy this just to listen to music and Movies and hardly few calls, Its a good buy. But if you need to kind of use it for office purpose, not recommended."
6738,4.0,"I bought this headphone specifically for office con-calls. The build is good, nice look and feel, soft earcups, and good battery life that enables us to wade through long calls with ease - but only if we are lucky enough to connect successfully to Zoom, MS Teams, Meet, or Skype which itself is a task! I use MacBook Air for con-calls and after more than one month of use, here is my feedback:
1. There were instances when other participants muted me because of the loud ""krrrr"" noise when I try to join the meeting.
2. Zoom and Skype doesn't recognize the headphones easily and even if everything seems to be okay when testing the mic and speakers, the headphone has let me down many times when I actually try to connect before the start of the meeting. Because of this, I was forced to keep a wired headphone (small ones that are used in phones) always by my side. The pathetic thing to have after spending 6K for a headphone!
3. Call switching doesn't always work smoothly between mobile and laptop.
4. We need to download the Jabra Sound+ app and can customize the headphone experience, which I think is good.
5. If we are fortunate to get connected to calls without any glitches, the headphone works well. The mic is good (I did a lot of testing with my friends) and the audio is pretty clear.
6. Charging works fast, which is a plus
7. The headphone is a bit heavy and the fit is not snug. There is a chance of headphones falling off when you bend unknowingly.
Overall, I feel this is not a good buy at this price point. This is priced at 10K on the Jabra India website. Lots of negatives and, surprisingly, a global company like Jabra hasn't paid any attention to usability aspects while designing these headphones."
6739,3.0,"To be frank I was worried with the reviews pepl had given on the supplier ( defect product was sent , damaged etc etc)
But I got brand new Jabra Elite 45H headset
Thanks to the Vendor

It’s my first experience with Jabra product and also review is based on first day usage
1. Pairing and registering the warranty was easy and well guided instructions
2. Jabra sound + app helps to test the headset quality with multiple sounds frequency tat will ensure device quality or defected
3. I took zoom and teams call for 4 hrs which was perfectly good and no complaints from the other participants on voice or noise quality
4. Jabra sound + app helps you to set and modify your audio quality
5. I had paired my IPhone and Laptop I could switch between these for calls and music in phone no issue faced
6. Leather quality is good doesn’t hurt your ears even though you r on long calls

Worth for money, in this price rage can’t expect more 😊
This feedback is based on day one usage
Will share feedback after few weeks
Thanks to Amazon and Vendor"
6740,3.0,"I also have Sony wh-1000xm4, and trust me Jabra elite 45h are even better than Sony.
I bought it in 7k and I am fully satisfied with the product.
Sound quality is just awesome.
Bass is so natural and thumpy.
You will may not like sound out of the box, Once you download jabra sound+ app, there you can adjust EQ.
Toggle switch to turn on/off is super handy and comfortable in day to day use, I don't know why other brands are using 3 sec press for turning on/off.
I daily use it for MS teams calls for office purposes and for listening to songs also, in both they perform exceptionally well.
I would say Its a one stop shop for all your headphone requirements.
Battery backup is also very nice, I charge it in around 15-20 days and I use it daily.

Conclusion: 100% Recommended."
6741,4.0,"Build quality: it has good build quality. Feels solid robust.

Sound quality: sound quality is average there is no bass. I would say this are meant particularly for calling.

Noise cancellation: very good noise cancellation. I have been using this for my office call on zoom and it reduces the noise quite well and the person listening on the other end will hear your voice crisp clear. But if the other person talking in the same room or playing video then it does reduce the noise but not completely and the other person will be able to hear some of the noise.

Battery life: it’s battery life is amazing. And also it has usb-c type port and supports fast charging.

Overall I liked the product after testing other products like Logitech h600, boult and zebronics."
6742,5.0,This headphone is designed and curated for working professional who are having continuously calls over teams and zoom. Best for meetings and office use
6743,4.0,"I am writing this review after a week of continuous use. My primary need was to buy a headphones for meetings and office work. Based on the reviews and description, Jabra elite 45h seemed to fit the bill very well. Here is my experience after using this headset.
Pros
1) Bluetooth works well. Ability to connect to my laptop and my phone at the same time.
2) Sound volume is good.
3) The dedicated mute button is good for people who are on meetings and conf calls.
4) Battery backup is good. I charged it fully when i started using, and 7 days later i still have a good amount of battery remaining.
5) Call quality is excellent. Noise cancellation seems to be working very well too.
6) C-type USB charging is convenient as most mobile phones nowadays are switching to this style.
Cons
1) The memory foam cushion is not sufficient (at least in my case). After using for about an hour, the plastic inside the ear cups start pressing against my ear lobs causing pain.
2) It is not breathable, so I need to adjust the ear cups every now and then to allow air circulation.
3) Sound quality is not good for listening to songs. Audiophiles may have to look elsewhere.
4) The material looks superior, but feels cheap on your hands.
5) No 3.5mm jack for wired connection (just an observation, in case someone expects both wired and wireless connection)
6) For some reason, my laptop paired immediately with the device, but on my mobile phone I had to install the Jabra software in order to pair the headset. Not sure if it is the case for everyone though.
Hope this helps you make a decision.
Edit - 10-Feb-2022
After using this for around 10 months, the ear cushions have developed a rip (see attached photo). You do not expect the cushions to fail so soon on a premium product. Knocking off one star for this."
6744,5.0,"Initial feedback after 1 hour usage.

1. Sound quality for video: Works quite well
2. Sound quality for incoming phone calls: works quite well
3. Outgoing voice quality: no complaints from audience on other side except for some background noise since the mic is near neck so it picks up all sounds in addition to speaker's voice
4. Echo: I can hear my own voice which admittedly is annoying but nothing that I can't live with

*****************
I am yet to start testing for actual purpose I brought this headphones for: Skype and MS Teams calls. Expect to update this section after a thorough testing of conference calls.

Edit: I was able to test headset for Skype and Teams call over 2 days.
Teams: very intermittent connectivity. Sound to other end is like that in a theater or Cinema hall and not useful for business calls without upsetting people. Always have to keep a spare headset which beats the purpose of a wireless headset.

Skype: worked well.

Verdict: this is not useful (for me) in long run as Skype is transitioning to Teams here and as such not of use to me. Such a pity as these are quite comfortable and the best battery life so far (still 90%) after so much testing."
6745,2.0,"I have been using this headphone mostly for conference calls and attending remote meetings. Used it with Google meets and zoom calls. I am giving it two stars based on my experiences below:
Pros:
1. The voice quality received on the other end is good and clear.
2. The audio quality of the other end is clear to me.
3. Bluetooth range is amazing, many time I move across the rooms and I can still hear the sound even I am around 15 to 20 feet away from my laptop.
4. It has a mute button which helps a lot.

Cons:
1. Initially as per the default setting there was a playback of my voice to me. I was able to control it via Settings in Jaba app and fix it.
2. The biggest problem with the head set is sometimes it gives a vibrating noise which makes it difficult to understand what other person is saying. It becomes annoying and I have to disconnect and reconnect the Bluetooth. Felt like there is some noise coming along with the audio from other end.
Due to this even if other points are good I generally avoid using this headset for an important calls and use a wired one. I am unable to fix it via any setting in Jabra app

This annoying vibration and rattling noise is the main reason I won’t recommend this headset for conference calls and meetings. It would be a good purchase if you just want to listen to music via Bluetooth from phone or laptop.

Recently I used Jabra app to raise support query to get this issue fixed but have not received any response from their customer care."
6746,3.0,"Hi, product build quality is good and easy to pair with laptop and mobile.

Only concern is over priced. After I bought I see that it’s coming at 4500 only."
6747,2.0,"Look and feel is great, sound quality was good. But the connectivity was not seamless. The headphones were not able to connect to other devices. I was able to connect to one device , but to other devices like laptop and Phone the headphones did not appear as headphones during the scan and also not able to connect at all. This initial experience led me to return the product."
6748,4.0,"Good Product, it’s my first over the head headphones and I use Jabra products in Office so was my expectations were met, Primarily bought these for work from home needs and wanted a good headphone where I can take calls effortlessly , sound quality is amazing, Call quality is crisp and clear , only drawback is that you cannot use them for an extended period of time, I used them for couple of hours straight and had pain in my ears, you also have to do multiple adjustments to find a sweet spot where they won’t fall off , earlier used to slip off my head , overall I am happy with the purchase , got them on offer plus cash back for 5.5K , wish there was a noise cancellation feature but then you have to spend more if you require everything on a nice pair of headphones 😊"
6749,3.0,Very useful for taking calls and compatible with windows. Only one issue is that the teams call cannot be muted unmuted using the button
6750,4.0,"Received product within a day. I bought this for work from home. It works well for calls in Skype and teams. Microphone works well as good as a wired one. Don't buy cheap wireless headphones as all of them have poor mike. Something like this should be bought.
No noise cancellation as described in product. In fact you will hear nearby sounds in a different way as of it is coming from other side.

It has voice assistant and volume buttons. Mute button as well. But mute button sync with skype or teams is not reliable, sometimes doesn't work as expected

Connectivity and range is very good.

Battery life is awesome. Comes for a week atleast."
6751,4.0,"The best you can get for the price. In my hunt for good quality wireless headphones due to work from home I researched a lot products with a decent price. Few points were the must for me-
1. Battery Life
2. Multi Point Bluetooth Connectivity
3. Comfortable for long hours
4. Voice clarity at the other end

Surprising this headphone is outstanding in all above points including music quality.
The battery life is enormous 50 hours is what is stated and I feel it’s that only. Multipoint connectivity is a boon. Comfort is amazing I’ve used it for entire day on training and no discomfort at all. I’ve a sennheiser HD420 and apple air pods as well however the music quality of this headphone is so good that I rarely use them now. You may not get that punchy bass but music is not all about bass only. Having dual microphone the voice clarity at other end is amazing. Personalised sound is the cherry on top.
Final verdict- for 5000₹ you don’t have a better choice. Go for it without a second thought."
6752,4.0,"I am not able to pair this with my Windows 10, not sure how to pair? Can anybody help me with?"
6753,5.0,"First impressions, look is good, feels sturdy, built is of good quality plastic, padding is soft can wear for long time but not if you have large ears. Sound quality is very good and can be optimised my the jabra app which makes the sound more better. Feels light on head. Given 4 star as I have large ears so it hurts a little bit on my left ear. Lows are good, vocals are damm clear, instrument separation is good. High and mids are good but can be better with the app as it optimise according to your hearing."
6754,4.0,"Review after continuous usage (for 4 to 6 hours of meetings in Teams ) after a month:

I purchased the item on a discounted price of ~5999.

Battery life is the one good feature you can totally rely on.

Connectivity: Random disconnections... not sure when and why.... atleast once in a day usage.

Audio quality: this is the fundamental feature of any head set. Unfortunately, Jabra failed to provide a basic feature working properly for a device. At the beginning of the call, audio quality is fine, you can hear others clearly. After 10 to 15 mins, you hear audio click-click sound continuously along with others voice. This really irritates the usage.

Noise cancellation: As this is not a feature committed with this product, no expectations.

Headset Fit: If you wear it for longer duration like more than 1 hour, you will start feeling the pain of ears are tightly pressed. I guess Jabra tried to keep it tight to supress external noise coming to your ears. But, at the end , main purpose of headset usage is gone... You can not use it for continuous meetings.

Conclusion: dont plan it for any continuous usage. Not useful of office meetings. Better try with other products that comes for same or better price that serves the clear purpose as a Headset."
6755,4.0,"Product is good but, original packaging was cut open and there were additional tapes on the products authentic ones. The tape on top of the buttons on the headphones were also dirty and full or finger prints. Awful experience selling used products for such expensive headphones. Cannot return because I need to use it urgently."
6756,2.0,"This headphone fit to all your requirement. Pros. You need a headphone for office calls✔️ you need a headphone for casual calls✔️ you need a headohone for music✔️ the sound quality and base is bang on. Switching between your mobile and laptop is smooth. They have two microphone which lets you heard to the other end cisp clear. Bluetooth range is better than any other brand. And battery life is oomph, I sometime forget the it needs to be charged also. For me it comes for about a week post full charge with office calls, personal calls and listening to music.
Cons. Fit is lose for indian average head. And jabra should work on this because they have a beutiful product but when it comes to fit it loses there."
6757,3.0,"My first Jabra purchase and surely it worth it, spl getting under decent discount, product is fresh Sep2020, Headphones are very comfortable and lightweight, plush material soft on you ears, Jabra App is intuitive and feature rich. I was able to connect it with my phone, smart TV seamlessly , though it took some effort to get it connect it with my windows 10 Dell PC.

Since it does not cover full ears there is some sound leak, button are bit difficult to get use to but certainly its not deal breaker."
6758,5.0,"Top product - it may be a slight disappointment if you are looking for a bass-heavy experience. However, if your main use-case is to take work calls, it works really well - decent mike and a comfortable wearing experience. It looks really nice too. Strongly recommend!"
6759,4.0,"I ordered 45h two days back (on 16 Nov) for INR 5499/- and received it this morning (18 Nov). I connected it to my laptop as we all as mobile and can tell you it works like a gem with both the devices (yes it is paired and connected to both the devices at the same time).

I bought this piece primarily for Teams calls (plus for a bit of personal use - music, movies). I can tell you that microphones are superb and really good for office purposes. I am not avid music buff so do not how to do a technical review here. However, trust me this piece works great as a normal headphone plus something that you rely on for your calls/meetings!

If you are looking for quality headphones at a decent price, then your search ends here!!! Please try to get it for ~5500 INR or less. Thanks!"
6760,5.0,"I bought it for my Son (9th STD) and daughter (5th STD). Very good for kids learning if you get it for Rs. 5000,like I did. Not worth more, as these do not have Boom mics (external mics). But very good for online school, while in dance and yoga sessions for kids..."
6761,5.0,"Best deal got it for 5399 with instant has back for hdfc on prime sale ( MRP on box is 9999 and was not available in Jabra online store)
Pro:
Jabar sound+ app to create profile and you can set your preference deep base, smoot and customise too .
Can pair up to 8 device and last 2 devices is connected simultaneously. So when ur watching some in laptop and if you get call on mobile it when you attend call it connects to your headphones automatically and switch to laptop when call get disconnected.
Call quality is awesome. No external noise. You can set audio feed back if u like. ( you can hear how you soud on call it like echo feeback )
Came with 50% charge and it took less that 45 min to get charge fully.
Comfortable to wear I didn't feel any discomfort while wearing continuously for more that 6hr

While pairing to phone or laptop it took time to connect compare to my OnePlus z or JBL bluetooth esrphones.

Will update after few months if any cons."
6762,4.0,I bought it for work from home use and it's pretty good for that. Sound quality is good. only i wish it has adjustable head band that would have been great.
6763,5.0,"I mainly bought this to use it with Teams. There are only very few BT headphones which works seamlessly over BT for win 10 and this would be one of them. Bought for 5K on offer.
Pros:
1. Seamless BT connectivity and really recommended for MS Teams / Mobile calls. Clear call audio
2. Very comfortable earpads ideal for long hour
3. Amazing Battery life. Daily I use to be in calls for about 3-4 hours and after 4 days still I have 40% battery left
4. Fast charging especially on Wall charger
5. Premium Build quality and matte finishing looks beautiful.
Cons:
1. Average for music listening / audiophiles
2. Though audio is crystal clear, you have keep it min 80% volume.
3. Volume could have been better
4. Too much of sound leakage.
5. Avg Noise isolation. Can still take calls with loud ceiling fan above."
6764,4.0,"I bought this headphone for my WFH purpose. It connects easily to 2 laptops which is my true requirement for going for this model. This headset is the most comfortable onear headset ever made and you will love it outright. There is passive noise cancellation and it's enough for my purposes. The beauty of this headphone though comes out of the Jabra Sound+ app. Once you have personalized it with your phone it sounds like a completely different device. This is simply awesome especially for music lovers. 50h battery life is something unheard of and still after a week of usage, the battery is going strong. Maybe once a month charging is enough for a heavy user like me. Should you buy this headphone? Absolutely yes unless you have a real good reason to break the bank for an active noise cancellation headphone."
6765,3.0,"Perfect headset for long calls during work from home. For Teams and Zoom calls, members on the calls told me that they do not have background noise. They do not hear anything apart from my voice or other human voice. I am not sure if this is Teams feature or this headset's feature.

Music output is good. Checked Amazon music and Apple music. Connects to my phone and Mac seamlessly. Windows 10 connection is good too.

I particularly like the option of hearing my own voice on calls, this ensures I am not too loud and I also know how I sound on calls."
6766,5.0,"It is essentially same as Evolve 2 65. It does not have the dedicated mouthpiece and it is not compatible with the jabra PC app. BUt here are the advantages of Elite 45H:
1. It has larger battery life (50 hrs)
2. It is exactly same performance as Evolve 2 65 in terms of sound quality
3. If you are not talking from a train station, the two microphone does enough. (Evolve 2 65 has 3)
4. It is comfortable enough to handle phone calls and occasional listening.
5. it works fine 20-25ft away with 2 walls in between. Even Apple Earpod pros stutter.

Here are the problems:

1. It has less wireless range (33 ft)
2. Maybe.......Maybe... talking with a ceiling fan running may cause some wind noise... because of 2 microphone design, but I have not tested it."
6767,5.0,"Amazon delivery was safe and well done. Product in itself was packed very well.
I went through reviews almost everywhere before converting my allegiance from Sony, had terrible experience whenever I tried other brands. Jabra - unfortunately I never heard of it until I saw them being used in current Outsourcing setups. Gave this one a try and boy it lived up to its billing.

Mids are alright, not those headphones for watching movies or listening to songs for hours. Its strength is on answering calls and listening to voices it's strength shows. For long hours of work this will stay cool as cucumber and lives long enough for couple of days.

Bluetooth is brilliant, The mobile app is a must and helps plenty customizing the headset to your needs."

6772,5.0,"I want this review to be short
I liked everything just two things. I didn't like are 1. Bass quality man it's really low I have use equilizer to extend bass you can do it too.
2. The extendables for earcups or what they are called in technical terms are made of plastic so I have also seen many review where they got broken.
I think just two pieces of iron strips attaching wouldn't but that costly for which they are compromising there built quality."
6773,5.0,Amazing sound quality at this price range. Battery life much better. comfortable nice look and light weight. Not deep bass but satisfied bass. Overall nice product go for it if you look batter sound quality at low price.
6774,5.0,"I wanted to use these headphones for a couple of days before I posted a review, but I am truly impressed with the quality. First of all, it's BOAT. Second, it's sleek and has a beautiful matte finish. Easy to carry, light weight, and the ear cushions cover your ears quite well providing an excellent auditory experience. I even use these headphones to meditate, because of the noise-cancelling effect it has. I chose the Luscious Black and I could not be happier with my purchase."

I am suitable but my friend is said is not good. I suggest you can buy rockerz550 because it is suitable for your ear 👂.
When you wear this headphone continuously 30 min then your ear are pain....but worthy in this price range ..🦋🦋"
6820,4.0,"I want this review to be short
I liked everything just two things. I didn't like are 1. Bass quality man it's really low I have use equilizer to extend bass you can do it too.
2. The extendables for earcups or what they are called in technical terms are made of plastic so I have also seen many review where they got broken.
I think just two pieces of iron strips attaching wouldn't but that costly for which they are compromising there built quality."
6821,4.0,Amazing sound quality at this price range. Battery life much better. comfortable nice look and light weight. Not deep bass but satisfied bass. Overall nice product go for it if you look batter sound quality at low price.
6822,4.0,"I wanted to use these headphones for a couple of days before I posted a review, but I am truly impressed with the quality. First of all, it's BOAT. Second, it's sleek and has a beautiful matte finish. Easy to carry, light weight, and the ear cushions cover your ears quite well providing an excellent auditory experience. I even use these headphones to meditate, because of the noise-cancelling effect it has. I chose the Luscious Black and I could not be happier with my purchase."

7383,4.0,"First feeling! Sound is great, but no bass!! clear sound, but too loud! good quality plastic used, but plastic??

Pros: -
- Great battery, 30-35 hours.
- Sound quality is clear, feels premium as per Sony standards.
- It's light weight. Good quality plastic (but plastic??)
- Good treble.

Cons: -
- Sound is clear, but, it is too loud. It is balanced, but, lacks bass & too much treble.
- Less cushioning for speaker pads, sound hits directly to ear, so can't use max volume. No cushioning for head support either. It's a budget product from Sony, too much cost cutting.
- No, ANC. It cuts a bit of outside noise passively, only when in high volume mode.

Conclusion: Not as per 2022 market standards !!! This can definitely be so much better with good hardware and cushioning."

7385,4.0,"This headphones is completely worth the price. It's sound quality is perfect as it is a Sony product but it's battery is on another level. It is giving around a whole week backup after hard-core use.

7480,5.0,"The headphones live up to your expectations coming at an affordable price.
The sound quality is top notch. Talking about the noise cancellation feature, it indeed cancels out the exterior noise, I had put it on my ears, played a song and simultaneously played another song on my TV, I really could not hear my TV's sound. I liked the design and it feels quite appealing.
Now I have two problems with the headphones firstly being it cannot be put on for a longer period of time. Adds a little bit of stress over your ears and they start to ache not much though but that's quite a concern. Second being the length of the wire, it's very long and often it annoys you because it doesn't get fit into pockets and all quite easily. Overall a quality product at this rate and I recommend to buy anyone who's interested and willing to give a shot at buying this headphones.
Packaging of the product can be much better. I'm unsatisfied with the delivery of this product."
7481,5.0,Not much comfortable. Doesnt fit over the ears well. Could have been better on that front. Sound is ok. I dont use them too often so I dont know how they perform over longer time in one sitting. Things could be changed a lot to make this a better sound device and comfortability.

1. Length of wire is long(approx ≈1.5m)

7516,3.0,This is pair of headphones have very good sound quality. Music experience is really nice. At this price point this one is surely a quality product.
7517,3.0,Okay product. Worth for the money. If you listen in high volume people can hear the music
7518,3.0,Value for money product but continuous use feels pain in ears.
7519,5.0,"As title says, it has great audio quality and bass and doesnt hurt ears when wearing but when it come to mic, its not thay great.
Mic doesnt pick up my voice from its usual position(on pc mostly, from what i noticed) so i hv to bring it closed to mouth and also boost volume through in pc sound settings. But otherwise even mic sound quality is good and krispy. Mic works on mobile good."

7527,5.0,"best product i purchased for 800 2 years ago..
bass achaa hai wire achii hai orr abhii 600 m mil rha hai best price for this headphone, quality is good, worth buying....uppar ka leather utar chukka hai..sound quality abhii bhi new jaisi he hai...dhyaan rakkhoge to shi he rhega"
7528,4.0,"The headphones live up to your expectations coming at an affordable price.
The sound quality is top notch. Talking about the noise cancellation feature, it indeed cancels out the exterior noise, I had put it on my ears, played a song and simultaneously played another song on my TV, I really could not hear my TV's sound. I liked the design and it feels quite appealing.
Now I have two problems with the headphones firstly being it cannot be put on for a longer period of time. Adds a little bit of stress over your ears and they start to ache not much though but that's quite a concern. Second being the length of the wire, it's very long and often it annoys you because it doesn't get fit into pockets and all quite easily. Overall a quality product at this rate and I recommend to buy anyone who's interested and willing to give a shot at buying this headphones.
Packaging of the product can be much better. I'm unsatisfied with the delivery of this product."
7529,5.0,Not much comfortable. Doesnt fit over the ears well. Could have been better on that front. Sound is ok. I dont use them too often so I dont know how they perform over longer time in one sitting. Things could be changed a lot to make this a better sound device and comfortability.

7546,3.0,"Only thing I didn't like about the product:-
1. Length of wire is long(approx ≈1.5m)

Rest everything is perfect... therefore according to price tag it's worth it🤝🏻🗿"

That's all what I found in my headphones after 3 months of usage...
I bought it at just ₹1299...

Important - (I think it's left side is louder than right side which is very weird that's why I exchanged but the problem was still same...)"

Booming sound quality
Made up of quality materials looks very long lasting
But there is always a ""but""
I'm giving it three stars because i wanted to use it for gaming...(considering its beast mode) but it has a bug in it
The voice breaks very often and sometimes it just blanks out
At last
It's a GREAT PRODUCT
Though I don't recommend it for gaming."

7713,4.0,"I am using boat rockerz 400 from last 4 years, as it’s old so I was looking for alternate headphones. After watching some YouTube reviews I tried Zebronics Zeb-Bang, MI super bass and boat rocker 450, but non of these headphones sound and bass was close to boat rockerz 400. This made me release not to trust YouTube reviews feel most of them are paid.

After seen Amazon reviews I bough boat rockerz 425 which delivered today. This headphone is amazing in terms of bass and volume which beats all headphones under price segment of 2000. Product quality is ok, blue color looks good. Must recommend for music and movie lovers specially bass lovers, cushions are comfortable to wear for long hours."
7714,4.0,Using it for gaming and listening to music and it's pretty good for the 1299 price.
7715,3.0,Good battery life and sound quality.
7716,4.0,"Audio quality is good for the price range, and microphone also delivers good performance during calls. It serves it's primary purpose. But wearing it for more than an hour causes severe pain in the ears. Having a type c port is one of it's benefits, dual paring is very helpful while using laptop and phone togather. There's a little bit of trouble when paired to a third device and connecting back to previously connected devices. It also has dedicated button to enable low latency or beast mode."
7717,3.0,For gaming
7718,3.0,overall experience is good. Build and sound quality both are good. sometimes It looks heavy.
7719,4.0,"They have very good sound quality and battery life.
The ear cushion is also comfortable..
Although it sometimes get disconnected on its own... I don't know whether its the product or the piece that i recieved...
Rest everything is fine... not great but just fine.
Its not for gaming.. as there is still lag in sound even after beast mode."
7720,4.0,"First of all, not sure on the other ratings that are right now in the product review. Both the reviews complained on the bass and audio quality. Not sure if it is specific to the item they received.

My honest review after using it for 7 hours.

1. Comfort
First and foremost thing, the headphone is very comfortable to use. No pain or discomfort felt after continuous usage. The ear pads are well padded and soft, doesn't cause any pain. The clamping is also not too tight to feel any discomfort.

2. Audio quality
You cannot expect a lot from a 1.7K headphones to deliver tremendous audio experience. For the amount paid, I feel the audio quality is good and worth the money. The bass is adequate but the mid's are ok ok.

3. Microphone
The microphone quality is average. You can actually hear the fan sound in the calls. Did a small recording using the Windows camera recording and I could hear the fan sound/ feedback in the recording.

4. Noise cancellation
For this headphone price, the noise cancellation is good. Passive noise cancellation is more than satisfying.

5. Connectivity
You can actually have 2 devices connected at a time. Pairing of the device is fair and simple. No hiccups, able to connect laptop, desktop, android mobile and a macbook without any issues. Dual pairing is also seamless with the minimum testing i did. Able to toggle between devices without any issues.

Overall, a satisfying purchase at a good price. May be, will add up more review points after using it for few more days."
7721,4.0,Ossam
7722,4.0,It has good sound quality. Works fine while gaming. But has sound leaks when it is loud. Has poor hinges. Mine has a bad hinge on left side which kind hard to rotate. overall it's a great product and value for money. It'd be best if the hinges were 360.
7723,4.0,"It is a very satisfying product made by boat under ₹1500 . The foam quality of the headphones are very comfortable , battery life of these headphones are quite good , the headphones design is quite impressive after all and the most important thing the sound quality of these headphones is great according to my opinion and even at full volume the quality of sound is very good and clear and most important thing that even at full volume the headphones sound stays at very comfortable pitch . After all it is worth buying"
7724,4.0,"Bass - 10/10

Sound Clarity - 10/10

Loudness - 7/10 (For me, it's less)

Comfort - 9/10 (According to On Ear Headphones)

Trebles - 10/10 (Quite balanced)

Build Quality - 7/10

Beast Mode - Not that much change in latency as compared to normal mode

Battery life - 10/10

That's all what I found in my headphones after 3 months of usage...
I bought it at just ₹1299...

Important - (I think it's left side is louder than right side which is very weird that's why I exchanged but the problem was still same...)"

7728,3.0,Very nice to use
7729,3.0,"The audio quality on the headphones is good.
But this might be a software issue or a problem with the decoder, perhaps.
When the audio is panning from left to right, for example in a 3D simulation, there is a point where the audio gets interrupted by a loud noise."
7730,3.0, Absolute beast
7731,3.0,Must buy
7732,3.0,"Reviewing after almost 4 months of usage

Only the problem is at full charge it shows 90...
And build quality not so great

Best in all boat headphones
It provides very rich sound with clear trebles and vocals..far better than boat 400,boat 550, boat 650 it can beat every headphone u feel a natural sound and not get distort at 100 volume...it provides very high base and the base quality is rich..punchy and very depth it having very premium rich base if u fit correctly to ur ears then ur ears gona do dance and sure ur ears will get massaged💥

Best in comfort all through it is a on ear but u can use upto 3 hours without any pain after 3 hours slightly feel uncomfort..u can see a full movie with this without any pain and sweat is matters about ur environment condition..

Go for it guys instruments are crystal clear

Loundness also great!"

When they say it has a very long battery life they mean it.
Booming sound quality
Made up of quality materials looks very long lasting
But there is always a ""but""
I'm giving it three stars because i wanted to use it for gaming...(considering its beast mode) but it has a bug in it
The voice breaks very often and sometimes it just blanks out
At last
It's a GREAT PRODUCT
Though I don't recommend it for gaming."
7745,3.0,The sound and looks are good but isn't comfortable if you have average to large sized ears.
7746,4.0,"Its been 6 months since purchase. The initial few months were complaint-free, but since past 2 months the Battery does not get charged beyond 90% and the headphone starts disconnecting below 80%.

Overall , a bit dissatisfied with the product. I am now concerned about the hassles I need to go through to get it serviced under warranty."

7761,4.0,"I am using boat rockerz 400 from last 4 years, as it’s old so I was looking for alternate headphones. After watching some YouTube reviews I tried Zebronics Zeb-Bang, MI super bass and boat rocker 450, but non of these headphones sound and bass was close to boat rockerz 400. This made me release not to trust YouTube reviews feel most of them are paid.

After seen Amazon reviews I bough boat rockerz 425 which delivered today. This headphone is amazing in terms of bass and volume which beats all headphones under price segment of 2000. Product quality is ok, blue color looks good. Must recommend for music and movie lovers specially bass lovers, cushions are comfortable to wear for long hours."

7770,5.0,"If you a music lover or having lots of calls, you can consider this budget friendly and soft headphones,
I can wear it 3-4 hours continuously and hardly any pain in my ears,

Prons :
Good base
Very soft
Good battery backup
Have aux connectivity
Decent look

Cons :
-You can't fold it
-Sometime Bluetooth connectivity issues, specially with macbook, I tried with 2 macbooks and have same issue of connectivity breaks, working fine with any other os or machine"
7771,3.0,"Sound quality and noise cancellation are fine but it does not fit perfectly in the ear thus causing mild irritation, joints seem a bit weak which could have been more durable. Aux cable support comes in very handy to me so it's a go for me."
7772,3.0,"I liked the product except that I find the voice announcements annoying. I would be grateful is there is a way to cancel it. It's the most annoying when it says in a very loud voice 'MIMIMUM VOLUME'. Sometimes I reduce the volume to the minimum level because I don't want the audio, but ironically the announcement comes in the loudest volume level at that time. Also, I don't understnd fully what it says because it is in a US accent. So it's not much useful for me."
7773,3.0,"First day review: Used it continues for 10 hours today I'm amazed with its comfort, battery life and easy connectivity. The headset isn't dual connect as you may see in a few reviews here. Charges very fast, under 2 hours for full charge, and use it long hours. I've connected it to my TV, awesome range and decent sound quality, bass is also decent. Surely it's a great buy for the price, go ahead!"
7774,5.0,Personally I'm very satisfied from amazon as well as from boat also coz from boat it's my first product and i can say yes! It's the brand you can trust atleast in their sound quality. Although when i got the product I've faced an little problem then i immediate raise an complaint in amazon and from amazon i got quick respond then they have replaced the product with in 2 days only!
7775,4.0,I like the sound output
7776,4.0,"Bluetooth is connecting two device at a time. Good sound, nice bass."
7777,5.0,Sound quality was good because it'll damage in 3 months and I was apply my warranty card then it'll repaired in 1 month😂
7778,5.0,"I bought these in October 2020 for 1500₹. I am not a tech Guru but I liked the sound quality, also found them comfortable and the battery backup is just amazing 😌. Its one side broke in September 2022 when I accidentally sat on it. That's its weakest point where the headphones and band joins as it is made of plastic and this is the most complaint issue by most of the people . I'm sure it would not break just by using it only if you try to break them or whatever you should not do with a headphone. So if you want to buy it buy it for sure but just don't throw it anywhere and don't sit on it I still regret that😭😭. And don't get scared that they will break, simply take care of them. Lastly don't buy it for over 1500 if it is over 1500 wait for the sales."
7779,5.0,The pad skin is extremely thin and weak. It got teared apart in first 3 month only. It is something which is irreparable and should have been built with quality. Still the headphone is working. It has been 1.5 years in use.

And finally boAt rocketz 550 over ear is built quality is best . according to money. Thnxxx"
7783,3.0,Like it
7784,5.0,"The Build quality is very poor, Never purchase this product. It broke in a 3 month even I was using this very carefully. It broke because the plastic used at that point is very weak and cheap.

I am soo much trapped after purchasing this as they will not give service because it is considered as physical damage and I can't use it anymore. A complete waste of money."

7793,5.0," condition after 9 months:
1.Sound quality is good.
2.Bluetooth connectivity is good.
3.buy it if you have no problems with long term use because after long time i presses skull around ear which make it uncomfortable.

7795,4.0,"I have 2 other earphones in the house a senhiser 220 which is 7 years old and going strong and moto 4 years old.
One very odd thing i found in this one is this actually sounds beeter over bluetooth than wired.... Tested on samsung a52 which has excellent 3.5 connectivity. With cord sound is avg. The sound stage is okish. The depth is good bass and treble i. e good enough for 60s to 90s songs. ARR also sounds good. Slow rock (MLTR) is above avg and recent tamil songs are good. All comparisions with the other 2 head phones. I am a purist and do not prefer heavy bass. This will appeal to such lot."
7796,5.0,I love Boat .. but a bit disappointed with this headphones .. i had high expectations... sound quality
7797,5.0,Quality of sound is good but the sound isolation is not much better...... Sound comes outside clearly..... Build quality not best but good..... Mic not available in this product....
7798,4.0,"Because it heats up our ears in 10 minutes.
I am in ear user , so will be fine later
I am reviewing after pTron Dual Driver
Purchase date : 8.11.22
Received Date : 12.11.22
Price : 1270.34 + GST 228.66 =1499
Review after : 2 day
I feels it's 50mm driver which makes bold or big sound and sound is very clear and bass mid high are similar
This is best for normal usses
It shows battery charge percentage in phone But there is no indication on charging time and play times always blinks blue light.
This steel blade is for show only which overlaps on the plastic.
It's 10% = 3 hour
I bought it because of the huge difference between 1 star to 5 star.
I think it is the king of over ear headphone who makes me boat fan I have never heard this kind of sound.

Cons
Heats up our ears
There is no indication on charging time
In Playing time Continuously blinks blue light
When it conected automatically increase full volume"
7799,4.0,Like
7800,4.0,I liked the product very much. Although it was kinda tight when I frist wore now it seems okay. I don't know if there is no inbuilt mic in this. But this actually works in favor for me because my phone's mic quality is really good and I wanted to use my phone's mic with headset and now I am able to do that
7801,4.0,It's a budget headphone. Don't expect too much out of it especially if you're looking for bass. Else everything is good. Just the colors shown in the picture are little dark but for actual product it's little faint.
7802,4.0,ok so the build quality is 9/10 comfortness 10/10 sound quality 8/10 crisp highs great mids and not oversatured bass only problem i face when i connect it to aux cable on my pc everything sound output and quality suddendly decrease beside that its a great product connectivity is also good you can buy it
7803,4.0,"Its sound quality is good
Connets with bluetooth
very comfortable to wear"
7804,4.0,"Headphone has a good Bluetooth connectivity and noise cancellation. For gamers it has latency issues, but it can be avoided by using an AUX cable.

7809,3.0,"I am reviewing this after using it for 1 month
Pros:
1. Very comfortable because the foam material is very soft
2. The sound quality is excellent
3. The battery backup is soo good like I can use this for all day with only 1 hour of charging but don't use it all day as it affects the battery
4. It's light weight and easy to carry around
5. It looks very nice and premium if you use it in the gym

Cons:
1. It's ear cushions are very soft like extra soft than other headphones so I feel like they can tear off if you use it roughly
2. Mic quality is not very good

But it over-all is the best product in this range if you get it in 1500"

You can safely bet your money on this headphone.
You'll not regret this"
7813,4.0,Sound gd but microphone not satisfying
7814,4.0,I have been using this headphone for a year now. In one year all the cloths given above the coushin of the headphone or whatever it is called came off. Sometimes it automatically get disconnected then you have to manually connect it again. Talking about the battery it is pretty good. Battery performance didn't depleted much in this much of time. Sound quality is also good you will get enough bass. Only problem is that mic is not so good and Bluetooth sometimes get disconnected automatically and coushins are not so good. Sound and battery life is good. I would recommend if you have budget under 2000 then definitely go for this one unless you want to record your voice using this headphone. You can use this headphone for calling. Also If you are a hardcore music lover the. You may get little disappointment bass is good but not that much and after one year the bass has become less.
7815,5.0,"I never expected this type of quality. Every thing is just perfect . Bass , clearity , volume , battery everything is perfect. When you hear bass boosted songs than you feel vabration on your ears and personality i like it . And who are gamer for that boAt giving aux cable when you use it you have no problem on gaming no latency . And when you play with aux cable I feel the volume is little down than Bluetooth volume but its enough for gaming . Personally I use 40% sound for gaming and its really clear no need to volume it up . ☺️"

7839,5.0,"it has a good matte finish, amd soft ear cushions, though it might hurt after some time of using, but its manageable. Moreover I tried google assistant using the headphone, it sounded very bad. Otherwise the product is good."
7840,4.0,Noise cancellation wasn't up to the mark!
7841,4.0,"Nice one , serves its purpose."
7842,4.0,Its good got the required bass sound but not fully noise cancellation can be heard some noise but would still rate 4 star because of sound quality
7843,5.0," condition after 9 months:
1.Sound quality is good.
2.Bluetooth connectivity is good.
3.buy it if you have no problems with long term use because after long time i presses skull around ear which make it uncomfortable.
4.Agar sahi se chalo ge to koi problem nahi aegi."
7844,4.0, Nice headphones for this price and this product build impressed and sound quality very nice and looking was so awesome
7845,4.0,"I have 2 other earphones in the house a senhiser 220 which is 7 years old and going strong and moto 4 years old.
One very odd thing i found in this one is this actually sounds beeter over bluetooth than wired.... Tested on samsung a52 which has excellent 3.5 connectivity. With cord sound is avg. The sound stage is okish. The depth is good bass and treble i. e good enough for 60s to 90s songs. ARR also sounds good. Slow rock (MLTR) is above avg and recent tamil songs are good. All comparisions with the other 2 head phones. I am a purist and do not prefer heavy bass. This will appeal to such lot."
7846,5.0,I love Boat .. but a bit disappointed with this headphones .. i had high expectations... sound quality
7847,5.0,Quality of sound is good but the sound isolation is not much better...... Sound comes outside clearly..... Build quality not best but good..... Mic not available in this product....
7848,4.0,"Because it heats up our ears in 10 minutes.
I am in ear user , so will be fine later
I am reviewing after pTron Dual Driver
Purchase date : 8.11.22
Received Date : 12.11.22
Price : 1270.34 + GST 228.66 =1499
Review after : 2 day
I feels it's 50mm driver which makes bold or big sound and sound is very clear and bass mid high are similar
This is best for normal usses
It shows battery charge percentage in phone But there is no indication on charging time and play times always blinks blue light.
This steel blade is for show only which overlaps on the plastic.
It's 10% = 3 hour
I bought it because of the huge difference between 1 star to 5 star.
I think it is the king of over ear headphone who makes me boat fan I have never heard this kind of sound.

Cons
Heats up our ears
There is no indication on charging time
In Playing time Continuously blinks blue light
When it conected automatically increase full volume"
7849,4.0,Like
7850,4.0,I liked the product very much. Although it was kinda tight when I frist wore now it seems okay. I don't know if there is no inbuilt mic in this. But this actually works in favor for me because my phone's mic quality is really good and I wanted to use my phone's mic with headset and now I am able to do that
7851,4.0,It's a budget headphone. Don't expect too much out of it especially if you're looking for bass. Else everything is good. Just the colors shown in the picture are little dark but for actual product it's little faint.
7852,4.0,ok so the build quality is 9/10 comfortness 10/10 sound quality 8/10 crisp highs great mids and not oversatured bass only problem i face when i connect it to aux cable on my pc everything sound output and quality suddendly decrease beside that its a great product connectivity is also good you can buy it
7853,4.0,"Its sound quality is good
Connets with bluetooth
very comfortable to wear"
7854,4.0,"Headphone has a good Bluetooth connectivity and noise cancellation. For gamers it has latency issues, but it can be avoided by using an AUX cable.
It doesn't have a good material quality and needs some extra care."
7855,4.0,Think for its
7856,4.0,AMAZING SOUND AND PERFOEMANCE
7857,4.0,Bass is little slow.
7858,4.0,Good Head phone in this price
7859,4.0,"I am reviewing this after using it for 1 month
Pros:
1. Very comfortable because the foam material is very soft
2. The sound quality is excellent
3. The battery backup is soo good like I can use this for all day with only 1 hour of charging but don't use it all day as it affects the battery
4. It's light weight and easy to carry around
5. It looks very nice and premium if you use it in the gym

Cons:
1. It's ear cushions are very soft like extra soft than other headphones so I feel like they can tear off if you use it roughly
2. Mic quality is not very good

But it over-all is the best product in this range if you get it in 1500"
7860,4.0,"Base is not good.
Sound is loud and clear.
Heavyweight.
Issues in BT connection."
7861,4.0,"I Generally Do Prefer To Use The 100% ""Company Seal Packed"" One (Item)"
7862,4.0,"For the given price, this headohone is pretty good, the design feels premium and comfortable.
You can safely bet your money on this headphone.
You'll not regret this"
7863,4.0,Sound gd but microphone not satisfying
7864,4.0,I have been using this headphone for a year now. In one year all the cloths given above the coushin of the headphone or whatever it is called came off. Sometimes it automatically get disconnected then you have to manually connect it again. Talking about the battery it is pretty good. Battery performance didn't depleted much in this much of time. Sound quality is also good you will get enough bass. Only problem is that mic is not so good and Bluetooth sometimes get disconnected automatically and coushins are not so good. Sound and battery life is good. I would recommend if you have budget under 2000 then definitely go for this one unless you want to record your voice using this headphone. You can use this headphone for calling. Also If you are a hardcore music lover the. You may get little disappointment bass is good but not that much and after one year the bass has become less.
7865,4.0,"I never expected this type of quality. Every thing is just perfect . Bass , clearity , volume , battery everything is perfect. When you hear bass boosted songs than you feel vabration on your ears and personality i like it . And who are gamer for that boAt giving aux cable when you use it you have no problem on gaming no latency . And when you play with aux cable I feel the volume is little down than Bluetooth volume but its enough for gaming . Personally I use 40% sound for gaming and its really clear no need to volume it up . ☺️"

7966,4.0,"Pons-They are good for the price they come. Sound is decent.
Battery life is long enough for 2 days (not countinously).
The wired features is a charm if battery goes dead. Noise cancellation is also decent.

Coming to the bad points.
Build Quality is a little Cheap according to the price , the hinges shouldn't be used that much it will lose it's grip.
Also the Bluetooth is not that grt , if you are on a vehicle and connected your phone you will hardly hear any song.
The connectivity is a issue. The dual connect is good but their is a latency of about 2-3 second when switching from one to another.

That's all, You can buy this if your budget is less and as a student this is the best headphones at this price range."
7967,4.0,"It's quite good to use with really good sound quality. But as i have used other headphones before, i found a bit bass and empathy of sound missing. I can hear a bit noice even on full volume. Sometimes it also doesn't connect with laptop using aux cable.
When there's low nattery and we put headphone on charging, it gets disconnected. We can't use it while it is being charged.
Otherwise, great comfort, light weight, clear sound and easy to use."
7968,4.0,"You won't be dissatisfied at all after spending 500 on it
• sound is good
• comfortable
• battery is good
• micro sd works good
• all features at this price range is perfect
• microphone records good quality sound
Drawbacks :
• people sitting on next to you can hear what you're listening to
• noise cancellation is zero
• microphone catches all the sounds in background
• the micro sd card and radio operates in full volume there is no option to lessen the volume
Conclusion:
It's great i highly recommend"
7969,4.0,"Received this product in mint condition.
Timely Delivery by Amazon.
Packaging was not so ideal from Amazon.
About the product:
Quality is as per price.
Accessories are of low quality espically the Auxiliary Cord,
Poor sound quality from aux cable.
The charging cord is also if low quality it's hard to connect it to the headset and you dear damaging the ear cushion.
I already have a micro USB cable which fits with ease and effective.
It's not a quick charging modle, takes approximately 2-2.5 hours for charging.
When i received the product it had no charging. First experience that the product has no charging.
The actual build quality of the headset is quite mediocre,
It's all plastic, the cushions are not firmly fixed.
Little gaps between base and cushions.
Charging indicator is present and also full charging indicator.
Ear cushion quality looks decent.
It's has FM function which is totally not workings,my area of residence has a fairly good reception of GM signal but the product fails to catch signal.
Bluetooth connectivity is excellent, it's quick and fast and without any delay.

About sound quality:
Sound quality is excellent for watching movies or web series or any video content.
It delivers very clear and crisp sound without letting the bgm over powering dialogues.
Music with aux cord is way below average avoid it try with some other aux cord (haven't tried yet)
Sound quality with Bluetooth entirely depends upon the music source music settings.
Like redmi phones have headphones selection option which enhances it's performance and even with Equalizer settings.
But it's not that thumping or thunderous.
My old leaf headset gives excellent quality.
Bass is limited and sometimes feels ok.
Treble is controlled which is a boon.
Decent battery back up.
Not that heavy which is a plus.

Over all , don't expect a out of the world experience.
It delivers what is claims but with limitations."
7970,4.0,"Sound quality is amazing over AUX but in BT,it is not good(you have to download 'EQ for BT' app from playstore to sound good), i think it depends on phone... I am using Redmi Note 7 pro, so it doesn't showing Equalizer in BT mode but in AUX it is there... So tweaking EQ, makes it perfect...
Bass is very very good, you will appreciate it. Trebble is average, you can increase using EQ. Vocal is also good.
Surround sound is quite good, instrument seperation is very good...
It is very loud and no distortion at 100% volume, You will not listen beyond 60% volume.
Mic quality is ok.. mic will not work in AUX mode, it will capture through phone mic. During phone call Mic is working, over BT only...(over AUX it is using phone mic, or you can use AUX cable with mic)

It also have SD card slot, u don't need to connect BT.

It is first impression, so i cannot say about battery life or any other problem, i'll update in future..
Edit: Battery backup is approx 16-18hr as i have noticed.(continuously 6 hr per day for 3 day still 10% left but at 10% it is always saying Power Low which is irritating....)

Sound quality is just Wow(specially Bass)... you will not regret...
Build quality is ok(for this price), feels little bit after 2-3hrs.

After apply coupon, i got 119₹ discount.. so it is best for me at this price...

Update: After 6days, i have replaced with new one because Right side driver producing a little bit low sound (15% less volume than Left side).
Thanks to Amazon for replacement. Now, new one is OK, after 15days no issues, i'll update in future if any..."
7971,4.0,"I bought these at 499, and at this price these headphones are great.
I'm not a heavy user so battery life of 7-8 hours roughly lasts 2-3 days which is fine for most cases.
One problem I find is that the earcuffs tend to come off which causes some trouble, but it takes just 2 min to put them back on. But still it's frustating.

Sound quality is better than average for this price range.
Overall Recommended!!!"
7972,4.0,"writing this review after 5 weeks of use. headset working as advertised. for initial 2 days, we spent some time figuring out how to pair it with out led tv. once that is sorted out, it is working smoothly. pairing is hassle free & seamless. range is good. voice does not drop / distort much when moving between different rooms of my house. we connect to it via Bluetooth only. once fully charged, lasts approx. 4 to 4 1/2hrs. will update this review after a couple of months of usage."

Don't buy."
7975,4.0,"Firstly
The Headphones Is Amazing At what Price it comes and what it Offers ( i got it for 599)

The sound quality is good , it's works on Bluetooth as well as on aux cable.
It's Also Charges Quick.

The Only downside is When You Use them for long hours ( More than 2 ).
Then it began to hurt the ears it's because the cousins are not so soft

Otherwise The Headphones are pretty Good"

7978,4.0,"PROS : I like this Headphone because it has giid quality sound with dual connectivity - Wired and Wireless. It also gives us FM Radio and SD Card Option, which is unique in such cheap Headphones.

Battery life is long enough for 2 days (not countinously).
The wired features is a charm if battery goes dead. Noise cancellation is also decent.

Coming to the bad points.
Build Quality is a little Cheap according to the price , the hinges shouldn't be used that much it will lose it's grip.
Also the Bluetooth is not that grt , if you are on a vehicle and connected your phone you will hardly hear any song.
The connectivity is a issue. The dual connect is good but their is a latency of about 2-3 second when switching from one to another.

That's all, You can buy this if your budget is less and as a student this is the best headphones at this price range."
8016,4.0,"It's quite good to use with really good sound quality. But as i have used other headphones before, i found a bit bass and empathy of sound missing. I can hear a bit noice even on full volume. Sometimes it also doesn't connect with laptop using aux cable.
When there's low nattery and we put headphone on charging, it gets disconnected. We can't use it while it is being charged.
Otherwise, great comfort, light weight, clear sound and easy to use."
8017,4.0,"You won't be dissatisfied at all after spending 500 on it
• sound is good
• comfortable
• battery is good
• micro sd works good
• all features at this price range is perfect
• microphone records good quality sound
Drawbacks :
• people sitting on next to you can hear what you're listening to
• noise cancellation is zero
• microphone catches all the sounds in background
• the micro sd card and radio operates in full volume there is no option to lessen the volume
Conclusion:
It's great i highly recommend"
8018,4.0,"Received this product in mint condition.
Timely Delivery by Amazon.
Packaging was not so ideal from Amazon.
About the product:
Quality is as per price.
Accessories are of low quality espically the Auxiliary Cord,
Poor sound quality from aux cable.
The charging cord is also if low quality it's hard to connect it to the headset and you dear damaging the ear cushion.
I already have a micro USB cable which fits with ease and effective.
It's not a quick charging modle, takes approximately 2-2.5 hours for charging.
When i received the product it had no charging. First experience that the product has no charging.
The actual build quality of the headset is quite mediocre,
It's all plastic, the cushions are not firmly fixed.
Little gaps between base and cushions.
Charging indicator is present and also full charging indicator.
Ear cushion quality looks decent.
It's has FM function which is totally not workings,my area of residence has a fairly good reception of GM signal but the product fails to catch signal.
Bluetooth connectivity is excellent, it's quick and fast and without any delay.

About sound quality:
Sound quality is excellent for watching movies or web series or any video content.
It delivers very clear and crisp sound without letting the bgm over powering dialogues.
Music with aux cord is way below average avoid it try with some other aux cord (haven't tried yet)
Sound quality with Bluetooth entirely depends upon the music source music settings.
Like redmi phones have headphones selection option which enhances it's performance and even with Equalizer settings.
But it's not that thumping or thunderous.
My old leaf headset gives excellent quality.
Bass is limited and sometimes feels ok.
Treble is controlled which is a boon.
Decent battery back up.
Not that heavy which is a plus.

Over all , don't expect a out of the world experience.
It delivers what is claims but with limitations."
8019,4.0,"Sound quality is amazing over AUX but in BT,it is not good(you have to download 'EQ for BT' app from playstore to sound good), i think it depends on phone... I am using Redmi Note 7 pro, so it doesn't showing Equalizer in BT mode but in AUX it is there... So tweaking EQ, makes it perfect...
Bass is very very good, you will appreciate it. Trebble is average, you can increase using EQ. Vocal is also good.
Surround sound is quite good, instrument seperation is very good...
It is very loud and no distortion at 100% volume, You will not listen beyond 60% volume.
Mic quality is ok.. mic will not work in AUX mode, it will capture through phone mic. During phone call Mic is working, over BT only...(over AUX it is using phone mic, or you can use AUX cable with mic)

It also have SD card slot, u don't need to connect BT.

It is first impression, so i cannot say about battery life or any other problem, i'll update in future..
Edit: Battery backup is approx 16-18hr as i have noticed.(continuously 6 hr per day for 3 day still 10% left but at 10% it is always saying Power Low which is irritating....)

Sound quality is just Wow(specially Bass)... you will not regret...
Build quality is ok(for this price), feels little bit after 2-3hrs.

After apply coupon, i got 119₹ discount.. so it is best for me at this price...

Update: After 6days, i have replaced with new one because Right side driver producing a little bit low sound (15% less volume than Left side).
Thanks to Amazon for replacement. Now, new one is OK, after 15days no issues, i'll update in future if any..."
8020,4.0,"I bought these at 499, and at this price these headphones are great.
I'm not a heavy user so battery life of 7-8 hours roughly lasts 2-3 days which is fine for most cases.
One problem I find is that the earcuffs tend to come off which causes some trouble, but it takes just 2 min to put them back on. But still it's frustating.

Sound quality is better than average for this price range.
Overall Recommended!!!"
8021,4.0,"writing this review after 5 weeks of use. headset working as advertised. for initial 2 days, we spent some time figuring out how to pair it with out led tv. once that is sorted out, it is working smoothly. pairing is hassle free & seamless. range is good. voice does not drop / distort much when moving between different rooms of my house. we connect to it via Bluetooth only. once fully charged, lasts approx. 4 to 4 1/2hrs. will update this review after a couple of months of usage."
8022,4.0,"THIS IS A GOOD PRODUCT UNDER 600 RS.
BUT
THIS IS NOTE FOR HEAVY BASS OR LOUD MUSIC LOVER .
BATTERY BACKUP IS ALSO GOOD."
8023,4.0,"It's by far the worst product from Zebronics. It doesn't fit like over ear product. Ear cups are not at all comfortable. Sound quality is also just ok type. Buttons feel dirt cheap quality.
Pathetic plastic finish.
Don't buy."
8024,4.0,"Firstly
The Headphones Is Amazing At what Price it comes and what it Offers ( i got it for 599)

The sound quality is good , it's works on Bluetooth as well as on aux cable.
It's Also Charges Quick.

The Only downside is When You Use them for long hours ( More than 2 ).
Then it began to hurt the ears it's because the cousins are not so soft

Otherwise The Headphones are pretty Good"
8025,4.0,Good sound quality. Bass poor. Build quality poor. All overall good product. Value for money. 3.7 star from me
8026,4.0,The voice is pretty slow when we connect aux in device on other hand when it's Bluetooth it sounds so good.
8027,4.0,"PROS : I like this Headphone because it has giid quality sound with dual connectivity - Wired and Wireless. It also gives us FM Radio and SD Card Option, which is unique in such cheap Headphones.

CONS : FM does not work correctly, even I live within 50 km Radius. I also encounter sometimes no sound is coming."
8028,4.0,"Pros
• Sound quality is better than expected
• Bass is awesome
• Connectivity is also good
• Cushion is good
• Battery backup upto 6 hrs in medium vol.
Cons
▪︎ Not that comfortable.
▪︎ Build Quality is worse, needed to handle carefully
▪︎ Buttons in the headset does not work properly
▪︎ Mic quality works fine, but not that great
▪︎ No noise cancelation.
Recommended in this price range. I've got this in 398.
If you get this headset around 350-500 you should buy it, none of the other headset is as good as this product"
8029,4.0,"Literally the extenders could have been little more long, as I found discomfort while wearing the headphones. The sound quality is good regarding the price and latency is fast. Built quality is also good. Charging port should have been C-type as it could have been made faster."

8032,4.0,"If you are planning to use this headphones while working out..Don’t! While the sound quality and the ear cushioning is good, be careful not to pull out the cushions. The gap to fit the cushions is very narrow and it tested my patience to put it back in. Overall don’t play with the cushions and you’re good to go! Worth the 500 bucks."

8160,4.0,"[Updated] Overall you really get what you pay for. They serve the purpose of a decent pair of tws for basic quality calls and music listening. Main problem I noticed was with the pairing and connection strength as they routinely lose signal for no apparent reason. Once or twice I had issue of only one of the buds getting paired and had to reset the other one to get it paired.
If you have paired these to one device and try to pair to another one without disconnecting from first it simply doesn't work. This is starting to get annoying but maybe I'll get used to it. We'll see.
----------------------------------------------------------
This is just day 1 review of these. Got them for Rs 898 on some offer on Amazon. I'll post updates later on. Hope this is helpful for anyone interested.

Package : The packaging is quite decent for such a low price. Comes with the tws earphones fitted with medium earplugs fitted inside the case. Also included are a very short USB c cable and two additional earplugs - small and large. Package includes some Noise stickers and a pretty good user manual and warranty instruction card.

Build : was immediately dissapointed with the plastic case as the lid was rattling and not confidence boosting. Will use it for a while to see if my worries are unfounded. The earphones themselves are rather sturdy feeling in hand. They fit very snuggly into the case and there is no evident feel of them coming lose or rattling within the case.

Comfort : This is very subjective and each ear is different. It's one of the reaonss I wanted to get a cheap tws to see if I'm OK with the form factor for long hours. The prefitted medium size earplugs were not comfortable so I switched to the small size ones. And after about 20 mins I forgot I was even wearing them. The earbuds are very lightweight owing to the plastic build but upside is that they don't cause any strain even after an hour of continuous use. One thing to note is that if you have ""Gandhi"" ears then the fit might be a little awkward - I should know. My ears covered the touch areas of the buds so I had to fiddle around a bit if I wanted to do any of the touch actions. YMMV.

Sound quality : I liked them. I'm no audiophile but they have decent volume and satisfactory levels of bass and separation. I tried my usual test at https://youtu.be/J0a2Prc_MQo and they fared quite well. The treble maxes out at 15khz post which you hear nothing at all but this is to be expected at the price point. There was noticeable vibrations creeping in at below 30hz but the L and R drivers seem to be matched well and all of the panning tests were quite decent. I feel this definitely punches above its price point.

Call quality : In a low to no outside noise environment the microphones were very good. There was no lag and the person on the other side said my voice was very clear. But things take a steep fall as soon as little noise is present and you start sounding like you're inside a well. Seems the mics can't figure out how to filter out your voice so they end up trashing the call quality. Overall you get what you pay for here.

Range : max I got was around 5m. Not sure how they tested and got 10m as advertised. Any disruptions like a wall will simply break the connection but they connected back automatically every time so far so I guess that's passable.

Pairing :
------ UPDATE on 12th Aug 2022 - - - - - -
Major issue here is that if already paired to a device like a laptop they simply are unable to be paired to another device like your phone. You have to unpair from the first device and then try to pair again. Had issues like only one of the buds pairing as well.
Have to fiddle around to get it to work and is not convenient.
---------------
I don't have a phone to test the fast pair features - Actually I'm not even sure these support it. Anyway, the earphones go into pairing mode as soon as you remove them from the case and I was able to pair with no problems on multiple phones. They will auto pair post this initial setup to previously paired devices. I could not find any way to control the pairing mode though. You have to live with what it comes with as there is no app or anything to control what it does. They switch off pairing mode once you put them in the case so hopefully that means the battery would be saved a little.

Battery life : Way too early to tell anything. Will share my experience post one week and one month. But they came around 80% charged in the box and I have stated to charge the case - Box says it will take 2hrs to fully charge it and there are basic indicators like a flashing red led for charging which turns solid red once done. The earphones also have LEDs that blink red & white to indicate pairing, low battery etc.

Sync issues : None so far. But have seen many such reports and reviews wherein the L and R earphones seem to go out of sync on similar low price TWSes. So will see if I face any such problems.

These are the primary areas that I am concerned with while evaluating any TWS so will share how my experience is after a while. So far I'm happy with them."

8206,4.0," At ₹899, it gets the work done. However, not a truly great quality wrt sound. Boat rockerz, the neckband type Bluetooth, at ₹1299 provides a much sharper quality. However, the feel of these Buds are comfy as well. The pair I've has a better sound in left bud compared to the right one. The case is sturdy and I tested dropping it from a feet or two. Overall, seems to have a good value for money ratio. Had a Boat 402 airdopes pair, at almost double the price (₹1700/-), but way better quality than these. Sadly, lost the boat pair! Will try grabbing a higher valued pair from 'noise' as well to have a better comparison. Like these for the value they provide. So grab these if u have a budget constraint, or as your opening pair of budget airdopes."
8207,4.0,"The earbuds are cool in look and sound .
There is just latency issue sometimes on call"
8208,4.0,"[Updated] Overall you really get what you pay for. They serve the purpose of a decent pair of tws for basic quality calls and music listening. Main problem I noticed was with the pairing and connection strength as they routinely lose signal for no apparent reason. Once or twice I had issue of only one of the buds getting paired and had to reset the other one to get it paired.
If you have paired these to one device and try to pair to another one without disconnecting from first it simply doesn't work. This is starting to get annoying but maybe I'll get used to it. We'll see.
----------------------------------------------------------
This is just day 1 review of these. Got them for Rs 898 on some offer on Amazon. I'll post updates later on. Hope this is helpful for anyone interested.

Package : The packaging is quite decent for such a low price. Comes with the tws earphones fitted with medium earplugs fitted inside the case. Also included are a very short USB c cable and two additional earplugs - small and large. Package includes some Noise stickers and a pretty good user manual and warranty instruction card.

Build : was immediately dissapointed with the plastic case as the lid was rattling and not confidence boosting. Will use it for a while to see if my worries are unfounded. The earphones themselves are rather sturdy feeling in hand. They fit very snuggly into the case and there is no evident feel of them coming lose or rattling within the case.

Comfort : This is very subjective and each ear is different. It's one of the reaonss I wanted to get a cheap tws to see if I'm OK with the form factor for long hours. The prefitted medium size earplugs were not comfortable so I switched to the small size ones. And after about 20 mins I forgot I was even wearing them. The earbuds are very lightweight owing to the plastic build but upside is that they don't cause any strain even after an hour of continuous use. One thing to note is that if you have ""Gandhi"" ears then the fit might be a little awkward - I should know. My ears covered the touch areas of the buds so I had to fiddle around a bit if I wanted to do any of the touch actions. YMMV.

Sound quality : I liked them. I'm no audiophile but they have decent volume and satisfactory levels of bass and separation. I tried my usual test at https://youtu.be/J0a2Prc_MQo and they fared quite well. The treble maxes out at 15khz post which you hear nothing at all but this is to be expected at the price point. There was noticeable vibrations creeping in at below 30hz but the L and R drivers seem to be matched well and all of the panning tests were quite decent. I feel this definitely punches above its price point.

Call quality : In a low to no outside noise environment the microphones were very good. There was no lag and the person on the other side said my voice was very clear. But things take a steep fall as soon as little noise is present and you start sounding like you're inside a well. Seems the mics can't figure out how to filter out your voice so they end up trashing the call quality. Overall you get what you pay for here.

Range : max I got was around 5m. Not sure how they tested and got 10m as advertised. Any disruptions like a wall will simply break the connection but they connected back automatically every time so far so I guess that's passable.

Pairing :
------ UPDATE on 12th Aug 2022 - - - - - -
Major issue here is that if already paired to a device like a laptop they simply are unable to be paired to another device like your phone. You have to unpair from the first device and then try to pair again. Had issues like only one of the buds pairing as well.
Have to fiddle around to get it to work and is not convenient.
---------------
I don't have a phone to test the fast pair features - Actually I'm not even sure these support it. Anyway, the earphones go into pairing mode as soon as you remove them from the case and I was able to pair with no problems on multiple phones. They will auto pair post this initial setup to previously paired devices. I could not find any way to control the pairing mode though. You have to live with what it comes with as there is no app or anything to control what it does. They switch off pairing mode once you put them in the case so hopefully that means the battery would be saved a little.

Battery life : Way too early to tell anything. Will share my experience post one week and one month. But they came around 80% charged in the box and I have stated to charge the case - Box says it will take 2hrs to fully charge it and there are basic indicators like a flashing red led for charging which turns solid red once done. The earphones also have LEDs that blink red & white to indicate pairing, low battery etc.

8258,4.0,"I will mention all the things pros and cons related to these headphones 🎧
1st noise cancellation - the anc in these headphones is just amazing considering the price many people are not understanding the meaning of anc they think it will just cut all the noise but the product claims it will reduce and cut low frequency noise like ac cooler car engine train engine noise which are like constant and will not cut music someone speaking (will reduce though) they work even if the headphones are off
1 thing i noticed is that when you run with anc mode on the headphones voice breaks if playing something on those WITH ANC ONLY and the audio is also sacrificed with anc mode on so i jsut use them without anc or just use anc without any media playing

2nd sound quality - this is my 3rd purchase from boult audio and i am not regretting.. the quality is great nor distortion the bass is little on the lower side but if you cover your ears properly its great

3rd PASSIVE NOISE CANCELLATION - this is the noice reduction with anc mode OFF the headphones reduce the noise like 50 to 60 % LOVELY....

4th battery life is great not tested it but the only charged it once so ...
5 they weight 220 gm but the company claims 150 but its not an issue for me
6 cushioning the pads are so soft didn't experienced and pain while walking cycling sleeping with these on
Pros
Well built tuff case
Great build quality (plastic build)
Battery life
ANC amazing
Compact when folded
Buttons feels good and sturdy
LOOKS LIKE BOSE :)
Have slider for anc on off no need to switch on the headphones
Cons-
Wired audio break with anc mode while running
Mic quality okkish
Micro usb
Not for pure bass lovers

Yeah that's it and i will definitely recommend these .....!!!"
8259,4.0,"I just bought this Boult pro bass Anchor today. Will keep it real short good budget headphones, good noise isolation.. but ANC I am not so sure about that . As I use realme Q2 anc earbuds , the feature is very noticeable in them unlike this boult anc headphones . May be is lessens upto 15-20 db noise but not more than that where as my earbuds provide a 25 db NC. Good sound output , good connectivity and very comfy. So Four stars ⭐️ ⭐️"
8260,4.0,"ANC: Useless. Changes ur perception of sounds/noises around you and also lessens them a bit but it's not significantly positive difference. There is this pressure thing that happens inside ears too due to anc feature. Also, sound quality gets muffled with this feature on so this feature is almost useless.

Battery: Good.

Comfort: Good, pads are great. Not over-ear tho, it's on-ear. But again, pads are sooooooo sooooooft. I can use these while sleeping. Light weight as well.

Build Quality: Looks and feels good, that's all I can say.

Latency of sound: Verrrry less. Lag is not noticable to me at all, pretty good.

Mic: 4/10.

Sound Quality: Bass is good, not exceptional or overpowering or brain rattling or 'EXXTRA', just serviceable. Sound is clear, vocals etc. What these do is not bad at all. Perfectly usable.

Sound is actually really good after you put the headphones on your ears properly.

My recommendation would be a green light. But... buyers can also choose Tribit Tune headphones at this price instead. I haven't tried them but I heard they may have better sound, perhaps. You be the judge. At least their mic is definitely better. I was gonna buy that Tribit one but chose these Boult ones for the looks and ANC. I am not disappointed with Boult, except for mic. Mic is crap."
8261,4.0," I purchased this product on 8th march 2022. Now, from some couple of days, I am getting issue when we watch the movie then automatic sound become pause and resume for some seconds. It's a technical glitch from brand but my returning window has closed. So, how can i return or replace this defective product.?
Please suggest."
8262,4.0,It came with micro usb port
8263,4.0,"Sound Quality is Good.
Microphone is having some intermittent issue with laptop connection.."
8264,4.0,the product page had mentioned type c charging port but actually had normal charging port so its a misleading information
8265,4.0,"In general the headphones are really good.. build could be improved, sound is great. Battery is crazy.. i almost forget when i charge them.. with 3-4 hrs daily usage.. lasts atleast 10-12 days. bought it for ANC feature, not very strong in that area. At 3K its an acceptable price. Recommended."
8266,4.0,"Let's face it
At a price of 3.5K INR, we should not expect much out of an ANC headphone.
1. The sound quality is good. (audiophiles won't look at Bluetooth headphones at this price range, so the sound is good for the average customer)
2. Noise cancellation is surprisingly good for this price range. (But obviously not up to the likes of the Sony-XM4, blatantly obvious cause otherwise they would not need to price it at 30K INR)
3. The most important, it is cushy and comfortable. You do not feel the pressure or the weight of the headphones on your head even after long periods, the padding on the earcups and the headbands are soft and the clamping force is also near perfect, not too tight
4. Battery life is good.
5. Comes with a hard case (Nice.)
6. Micro usb😟( Common at this price range but still..)
7. Looks amazing on the head, with no extensions or gaps between it and your head (and premium too!) which is a nice bonus😄😄.
8. Pairs with two devices at the same time."
8267,4.0,"Sound Quality is good , however, I paid this much for ANC which is no were even near to OK. Thus, if ANC is requirement, this is not the product to go for."
8268,4.0,"It's been 3 months now and I'm extremely happy with the product performance.
The sound quality is too good and even noise cancellation works supurb and that also in this price range is just unbelievable.
Premium product finishing with great comfort by having leather finishing cushions.
About the battery backup, I won't say it's having good battery backup but can say it's a power house as I no need to recharge the battery more then twice in a month.
Awesome performance, awesome product, awesome build quality.
I'll highly recommend this product.

Thanks to Boult for creating such a awesome product."
8269,4.0,It was advertised as having USB-C fast charging on Amazon..but it instead uses Micro-USB..this is disappointing.

8276,4.0,"When connected to 2 devices the audio doesn't play.......on the first day I checked dual pairing and it worked properly but after few days it stopped working.....and this is the 2nd piece....on the first headphone too the same problem occured

The rest other features are pretty decent"
8277,4.0,"It is really good product. The only problem is, you can't use this for long time. Your ear would start paining"
8278,4.0,"I found it to be pretty low on sound output and bass. So I returned this and purchased the Fire Boltt Blast 1400, which was not only 1000 bucks cheaper but was also just mind blowing with thumping bass and crystal clear high definition sound

My score:
Boult Audio ProBass Anchor: 6 out of 10
Fire Boltt Blast 1400: 9 out of 10"
8279,4.0,"Overall good but there is big problem, when i connect to samsung phone, wifi stop working ..look like it is not compatible with Samsung phones"
8280,4.0,Voice is not good
8281,4.0,"Good headphones for the price, doesn't sound good with aux or with ANC switched on, but on bluetooth it has good amount of sound and a little bass, if you're looking only for bass go for other headphones as it has a decent amount of bass. Comfort fit everything else is good for the price. If ANC is important don't buy, as we can still hear outside sound with ANC switched on, and while ANC is switched on the sound is flat.
Giving 5 stars for bluetooth sound quality only."

1 thing i noticed is that when you run with anc mode on the headphones voice breaks if playing something on those WITH ANC ONLY and the audio is also sacrificed with anc mode on so i jsut use them without anc or just use anc without any media playing

2nd sound quality - this is my 3rd purchase from boult audio and i am not regretting.. the quality is great nor distortion the bass is little on the lower side but if you cover your ears properly its great

3rd PASSIVE NOISE CANCELLATION - this is the noice reduction with anc mode OFF the headphones reduce the noise like 50 to 60 % LOVELY....

4th battery life is great not tested it but the only charged it once so ...
5 they weight 220 gm but the company claims 150 but its not an issue for me
6 cushioning the pads are so soft didn't experienced and pain while walking cycling sleeping with these on
Pros
Well built tuff case
Great build quality (plastic build)
Battery life
ANC amazing
Compact when folded
Buttons feels good and sturdy
LOOKS LIKE BOSE :)
Have slider for anc on off no need to switch on the headphones
Cons-
Wired audio break with anc mode while running
Mic quality okkish
Micro usb
Not for pure bass lovers

Yeah that's it and i will definitely recommend these .....!!!"
8307,4.0,"I just bought this Boult pro bass Anchor today. Will keep it real short good budget headphones, good noise isolation.. but ANC I am not so sure about that . As I use realme Q2 anc earbuds , the feature is very noticeable in them unlike this boult anc headphones . May be is lessens upto 15-20 db noise but not more than that where as my earbuds provide a 25 db NC. Good sound output , good connectivity and very comfy. So Four stars ⭐️ ⭐️"
8308,4.0,"ANC: Useless. Changes ur perception of sounds/noises around you and also lessens them a bit but it's not significantly positive difference. There is this pressure thing that happens inside ears too due to anc feature. Also, sound quality gets muffled with this feature on so this feature is almost useless.

Battery: Good.

Comfort: Good, pads are great. Not over-ear tho, it's on-ear. But again, pads are sooooooo sooooooft. I can use these while sleeping. Light weight as well.

Build Quality: Looks and feels good, that's all I can say.

Latency of sound: Verrrry less. Lag is not noticable to me at all, pretty good.

Mic: 4/10.

Sound Quality: Bass is good, not exceptional or overpowering or brain rattling or 'EXXTRA', just serviceable. Sound is clear, vocals etc. What these do is not bad at all. Perfectly usable.

Sound is actually really good after you put the headphones on your ears properly.

My recommendation would be a green light. But... buyers can also choose Tribit Tune headphones at this price instead. I haven't tried them but I heard they may have better sound, perhaps. You be the judge. At least their mic is definitely better. I was gonna buy that Tribit one but chose these Boult ones for the looks and ANC. I am not disappointed with Boult, except for mic. Mic is crap."
8309,4.0," I purchased this product on 8th march 2022. Now, from some couple of days, I am getting issue when we watch the movie then automatic sound become pause and resume for some seconds. It's a technical glitch from brand but my returning window has closed. So, how can i return or replace this defective product.?
Please suggest."
8310,4.0,It came with micro usb port
8311,4.0,"Sound Quality is Good.
Microphone is having some intermittent issue with laptop connection.."
8312,4.0,the product page had mentioned type c charging port but actually had normal charging port so its a misleading information
8313,4.0,"In general the headphones are really good.. build could be improved, sound is great. Battery is crazy.. i almost forget when i charge them.. with 3-4 hrs daily usage.. lasts atleast 10-12 days. bought it for ANC feature, not very strong in that area. At 3K its an acceptable price. Recommended."
8314,4.0,"Let's face it
At a price of 3.5K INR, we should not expect much out of an ANC headphone.
1. The sound quality is good. (audiophiles won't look at Bluetooth headphones at this price range, so the sound is good for the average customer)
2. Noise cancellation is surprisingly good for this price range. (But obviously not up to the likes of the Sony-XM4, blatantly obvious cause otherwise they would not need to price it at 30K INR)
3. The most important, it is cushy and comfortable. You do not feel the pressure or the weight of the headphones on your head even after long periods, the padding on the earcups and the headbands are soft and the clamping force is also near perfect, not too tight
4. Battery life is good.
5. Comes with a hard case (Nice.)
6. Micro usb😟( Common at this price range but still..)
7. Looks amazing on the head, with no extensions or gaps between it and your head (and premium too!) which is a nice bonus😄😄.
8. Pairs with two devices at the same time."
8315,4.0,"Sound Quality is good , however, I paid this much for ANC which is no were even near to OK. Thus, if ANC is requirement, this is not the product to go for."
8316,4.0,"It's been 3 months now and I'm extremely happy with the product performance.
The sound quality is too good and even noise cancellation works supurb and that also in this price range is just unbelievable.
Premium product finishing with great comfort by having leather finishing cushions.
About the battery backup, I won't say it's having good battery backup but can say it's a power house as I no need to recharge the battery more then twice in a month.
Awesome performance, awesome product, awesome build quality.
I'll highly recommend this product.

Thanks to Boult for creating such a awesome product."
8317,4.0,It was advertised as having USB-C fast charging on Amazon..but it instead uses Micro-USB..this is disappointing.
8318,4.0,"It is giving only listening, no micro phone working"
8319,4.0,"Audio, ANC, are good
Bass is not as expected"
8320,3.0,GOOD
8321,4.0,Totally amazing product no need to think about this. Just for it.
8322,4.0,"ANC is surprisingly good , block almost 75% of ambient noise , base is not adequate, could have been better , build quality is satisfactory in 4k range, and the solid cover is a plus point"
8323,4.0,Cannot increase volume in headphones
8324,4.0,"When connected to 2 devices the audio doesn't play.......on the first day I checked dual pairing and it worked properly but after few days it stopped working.....and this is the 2nd piece....on the first headphone too the same problem occured

The rest other features are pretty decent"
8325,4.0,"It is really good product. The only problem is, you can't use this for long time. Your ear would start paining"
8326,4.0,"I found it to be pretty low on sound output and bass. So I returned this and purchased the Fire Boltt Blast 1400, which was not only 1000 bucks cheaper but was also just mind blowing with thumping bass and crystal clear high definition sound

My score:
Boult Audio ProBass Anchor: 6 out of 10
Fire Boltt Blast 1400: 9 out of 10"
8327,4.0,"Overall good but there is big problem, when i connect to samsung phone, wifi stop working ..look like it is not compatible with Samsung phones"
8328,4.0,Voice is not good
8329,4.0,"Good headphones for the price, doesn't sound good with aux or with ANC switched on, but on bluetooth it has good amount of sound and a little bass, if you're looking only for bass go for other headphones as it has a decent amount of bass. Comfort fit everything else is good for the price. If ANC is important don't buy, as we can still hear outside sound with ANC switched on, and while ANC is switched on the sound is flat.
Giving 5 stars for bluetooth sound quality only."
8330,4.0,"Sound quality is superb with anc controller,
And very comfortable for which I was looking.

Just in ANC it seems like the headphone is pulling the vaccum formed in ear out.
So not able to use ANC for long time.
But overall more than satisfactory.
Loved the product.
Thanx boult..."
8338,4.0,"Sound quality - 4/10

If you have used any premium or a good branded headphones earlier please dont buy this one. Wait and save few more thousands and buy a decent headphones."
8339,3.0,A value for money product. ANC is not to the mark of Advertising. But as I feel this is what we get at this price point. Not disappointed.. it's a overall Good Quality Product I recieved

8452,4.0,"The watch is great for the price. Most things work great. Has great battery life. As a dailywear, there's not much to worry about. It detects activity but that happens only after a considerable amount of time (20 minutes). One cannot change the activity detection sensitivity or time.

The watch is not very intuitive to use. It's usually great and most features can be accessed easily but certain things take more clicks and taps than should be required in a compact device. So all the features are there, but it takes a bit of time to find them.
Sleep tracking is decent.

Phone calls have good quality. People can hear your voice even if there is reasonable disturbance. If you answered through your phone and now want to switch to your watch, you cannot do that. And you can only save at most 10 contacts. You cannot dial numbers. But the mic and speaker of the watch is good

Also, a confusing thing is, why does the watch not have audio alarms, when it is capable of producing sound?"
8453,4.0,"good one i got this 1399 ... i write this review after 2 month usage .. battery is awesome if u not connected with phone it gives 10 days while connected in phone it battery life become 4 or 5 days .. if u need accurate calculate your heart beat ,walk pls go with another its worthy but not accurate , calling function and u can speak through connected with your phone dont expect high quality in call but its not bad it become average it has 150 plus watch faces and you can customise with your photos . mainly some time its failed with you connect with mobile ,i mainly facing this issue , and but at this price it's value for money budget friendly watch i will suggest for budget buys with bluetooth caling future ..."
8454,4.0,"I have tried BOAT and FIREBOLT also and found this as the best so returned the other two.
I will discuss the pros and cons but before that I must say that the accuracy of readings are pathetic especially sleep monitoring .
All the smartwatches in the market at this price range doesn't give accurate results as smartbands... I am disappointed with that .. but why I finally chose to keep the Noise buzz and return boat wave lite and FIREBOLT ninja call pro ----

Pros
1. Good battery life , better than FIREBOLT ninja which was about 2 days.. Noise gives almost 3 to 4 days battery life with normal usage.
2. Calling is quite good quality ( FIREBOLT was also good )
3. The settings of DND , SMART DND, SILENT , VIBRATION is better.
4. Vibration is good and really wakes u up unlike the other watches where vibration can't be adjusted and doesn't wake you up.. here vibration can be adjusted if you want more or less amount.

Cons
1. Pathetic accuracy. Don't take this watch if you are only looking for sleep monitoring , heart beat etc. It's better to buy a good smartband for that.
2. Interface is not the best but it's okay

I bought this calling watch for 1700 in the great Indian festival and I feel at this price range it was the best as I have used Boat wave lite(non calling watch at 1200) and FIREBOLT ninja call pro ( 1800rs ) .I finally decided to keep the Noise and return the rest."
8455,4.0,"After 1 month of use I feel this wat h is value for money as it provide calling under 2k
Point to be noted-if you are buying this watch above 1.5 to 1.7k it's a good choice but more than that you can find other trusted brand like boat or dizo"
8456,4.0,Overall best but Side Button is not working within 2 months maybe it's with my watch

8462,4.0,Noice watch 😍
8463,4.0,Nice product
8464,4.0,"Bought this at 1699 and was ok with thebfeatires and price but found more advanced features at se
Or lesser price from other brands. Still a good deal.
Missing features at same price point are
1. Voice asst
2. Calculator
3. Games
4. Bp

Notifications stay like messages and have to be deleted like messages once in watch and again in phone.
Bluetooth calling is more like a tws earphone a separate function, but cannot play music or other streaming other than phone calls. Not even whatsapp calls. Practically nothing more than a show off. Wrist turn awake to show time is a good feature especially with disable feature at night but it takes a second to turn on which is slow.
Auto detection of workouts did show up after 5 mins of walking but never recorded anything. Reminders are not repeatable. Alarms cannot be named. Watch faces are not impressive.

Strap is plugbin type and notnpin type so is proprietary and not generic pin type.

Unable to return it for better deals even if not happy with features/performance"
8465,4.0,"This my first smart watch I have owned, though I am not a tech paralyse. I know am a bit techie, therefore here is my review.
pros -
1. Easy to use and easy to connect.
2. Accurate data analysied.
3. Never disconnect in calls, just one tap connect.
4. Basic interference to use.
5. Bluetooth is good.
6. yes this is waterproof, went in shower with this on nothing happen but dont over do it.
7. Good watch faces could add more.

cons -
1. Battery life - yes, everyone talking that battery is good, though it is good but was expecting better battery life. with call features on max 2 days it can restarin.
2. Could add a ringtone ! my personal choice.
3. wrist awake feature is not good.

conclusion - This watch is good in this price but not best in class. If you can spend more you will get better watch this."

8468,4.0,I got it for 1499/- during Great Indian sell. So at this price point it is good. But one thing i do not like is i can't stop it's Bluetooth if i plan to use it as only watch. That drains is battery. Otherwise battery will last much much more than one week.

8497,4.0,"a bit issue with sports mode while counting steps , else over all its good one"
8498,4.0,All functions is good at price but looks are cheap quality
8499,4.0,Product is good
8500,4.0,"The watch is great for the price. Most things work great. Has great battery life. As a dailywear, there's not much to worry about. It detects activity but that happens only after a considerable amount of time (20 minutes). One cannot change the activity detection sensitivity or time.

The watch is not very intuitive to use. It's usually great and most features can be accessed easily but certain things take more clicks and taps than should be required in a compact device. So all the features are there, but it takes a bit of time to find them.
Sleep tracking is decent.

Phone calls have good quality. People can hear your voice even if there is reasonable disturbance. If you answered through your phone and now want to switch to your watch, you cannot do that. And you can only save at most 10 contacts. You cannot dial numbers. But the mic and speaker of the watch is good

Also, a confusing thing is, why does the watch not have audio alarms, when it is capable of producing sound?"
8501,4.0,"good one i got this 1399 ... i write this review after 2 month usage .. battery is awesome if u not connected with phone it gives 10 days while connected in phone it battery life become 4 or 5 days .. if u need accurate calculate your heart beat ,walk pls go with another its worthy but not accurate , calling function and u can speak through connected with your phone dont expect high quality in call but its not bad it become average it has 150 plus watch faces and you can customise with your photos . mainly some time its failed with you connect with mobile ,i mainly facing this issue , and but at this price it's value for money budget friendly watch i will suggest for budget buys with bluetooth caling future ..."
8502,4.0,"I have tried BOAT and FIREBOLT also and found this as the best so returned the other two.
I will discuss the pros and cons but before that I must say that the accuracy of readings are pathetic especially sleep monitoring .
All the smartwatches in the market at this price range doesn't give accurate results as smartbands... I am disappointed with that .. but why I finally chose to keep the Noise buzz and return boat wave lite and FIREBOLT ninja call pro ----

Pros
1. Good battery life , better than FIREBOLT ninja which was about 2 days.. Noise gives almost 3 to 4 days battery life with normal usage.
2. Calling is quite good quality ( FIREBOLT was also good )
3. The settings of DND , SMART DND, SILENT , VIBRATION is better.
4. Vibration is good and really wakes u up unlike the other watches where vibration can't be adjusted and doesn't wake you up.. here vibration can be adjusted if you want more or less amount.

Cons
1. Pathetic accuracy. Don't take this watch if you are only looking for sleep monitoring , heart beat etc. It's better to buy a good smartband for that.
2. Interface is not the best but it's okay

I bought this calling watch for 1700 in the great Indian festival and I feel at this price range it was the best as I have used Boat wave lite(non calling watch at 1200) and FIREBOLT ninja call pro ( 1800rs ) .I finally decided to keep the Noise and return the rest."
8503,4.0,"After 1 month of use I feel this wat h is value for money as it provide calling under 2k
Point to be noted-if you are buying this watch above 1.5 to 1.7k it's a good choice but more than that you can find other trusted brand like boat or dizo"
8504,4.0,Overall best but Side Button is not working within 2 months maybe it's with my watch
8505,4.0,Overall performance is good but it takes a little long time to connect with phone
8506,4.0,Nice and cheap product easy for everyone for buying
8507,4.0,Like as I said value for money.must buy this
8508,4.0,"Good! Nice battery back up, resonable.."
8509,4.0,I just like the product
8510,4.0,Noice watch 😍
8511,4.0,Nice product
8512,4.0,"Bought this at 1699 and was ok with thebfeatires and price but found more advanced features at se
Or lesser price from other brands. Still a good deal.
Missing features at same price point are
1. Voice asst
2. Calculator
3. Games
4. Bp

Notifications stay like messages and have to be deleted like messages once in watch and again in phone.
Bluetooth calling is more like a tws earphone a separate function, but cannot play music or other streaming other than phone calls. Not even whatsapp calls. Practically nothing more than a show off. Wrist turn awake to show time is a good feature especially with disable feature at night but it takes a second to turn on which is slow.
Auto detection of workouts did show up after 5 mins of walking but never recorded anything. Reminders are not repeatable. Alarms cannot be named. Watch faces are not impressive.

Strap is plugbin type and notnpin type so is proprietary and not generic pin type.

Unable to return it for better deals even if not happy with features/performance"
8513,4.0,"This my first smart watch I have owned, though I am not a tech paralyse. I know am a bit techie, therefore here is my review.
pros -
1. Easy to use and easy to connect.
2. Accurate data analysied.
3. Never disconnect in calls, just one tap connect.
4. Basic interference to use.
5. Bluetooth is good.
6. yes this is waterproof, went in shower with this on nothing happen but dont over do it.
7. Good watch faces could add more.

cons -
1. Battery life - yes, everyone talking that battery is good, though it is good but was expecting better battery life. with call features on max 2 days it can restarin.
2. Could add a ringtone ! my personal choice.
3. wrist awake feature is not good.

conclusion - This watch is good in this price but not best in class. If you can spend more you will get better watch this."

The watch's capsule is made up of pure stainless steel. Whenever someone looks at the watch, they aren't able to tell that it only cost me 2K bucks, as the display of the watch, gives an expensive vibe. But, the screen of the watch hasn't covered the whole glass (as shown on the cover of the box of the watch). Pixels of the watch could have been improved & they could have added one or two more games too! Spo2, Heart Rate, steps, weather & sleep tracker are quite accurate, would have rated it a 5/5 if they wouldn't have had done fake marketing of the product.

8551,4.0,"First thing is that for the price it's a ""fairly good watch"" i would give it an easy 3.8⭐.
The problem's that I faced using this watch is that the battery of this watch is not really that great, you get a maximum of 3 days and a few hours of battery life. Mind you that I have disabled everything, including the vibration, phone and the brightness reduced to nearly 10%. So if you want a better battery, don't take this. And second is that since this one has a call feature, it has a really annoying and very loud tune that rings when someone calls you and there is no option of muting that ring or any sorts. The rest, like I said 3.8⭐"

8553,4.0,It is overall a good product. The calling quality and speaker quality is good in this budget. It goes 2 days in one go after charging. Slight issue with the button and the screen doesn't lit up when I turn my wrist. Overall it's a good product.
8554,4.0,The watch looks very good and is very easy to operate. The body of the frame is metallic which makes the watch a bit heavy but the quality is very nice. There are few coupons also available in the box which you can redeem and get exciting offers.

8557,4.0,"Well.. I guess u should hope for much at this price point, but still it's good enough for giving u an idea about the actual data.. Like it's not 100% accurate but yeah.. It's okeish.. ✌"
8558,4.0,"This bolt watch is a reasonable product for a daily use. And for phisical fitness, I can give a 4 out of 5 rating ."
8559,4.0,"This watch is amazing and worth it.
It is very economical and in budget watch having numerous features.Need to improve in battery backup thing.
Overall experience is good."
8560,4.0,"The watch looks amazing, metal body gives it a sturdy look and solid feel. the touch interface is very smooth as compared to other watches in same category and it comes with variety of different features"
8561,4.0,At price under 2k... Metal body... Bluetooth calling and most of the smart watch features... The round dial is just a class design...screen quality is good... Best for everyday use
8562,4.0,"I like the quality of watch is very good. And accuracy of sleep, touch screen, and all good. Price is also affordable."
8563,4.0,Just received the product today. At first glance looks good and promising.But yet to explore all of its features. I will update the review after few weeks of use.
8564,4.0,"Writing this review after gifting if to my brother and using for 1 hour. Watch touch screen is awesome, no lag and smooth running. Charging is quite fast. 20 minutes and 20-60% charge. Watch is good looking too. I haven't test the sleep tracking yet. But my bro will surely tell the sleep tracking experience and I'll edit this review. The only bad (actually worst) thing about this watch is that the sensors are fully fake. I tested it on a table and it shows that the table has 78 bpm. If you wear it you will also get the same result. Watch is quite good, you could go for it if you are not looking for a heart beat, SpO2 sensing watch because they are worst."
8565,4.0," I am writing this detailed review after using this product for a week:

Build Quality: It is metal body but not the pure metal material, overall build quality is good.

Screen: Amazing experience with screen, even it is not Amoled display but you will not feel the need as brightness is sufficient when wants to use in Sunlight. Touch is very smooth but you will get scratches on screen easily. Wakeup function was not working initially but worked pretty well after resetting.

Accuracy: Most of the Smartwatches measure ghost reading so this does but overall accuracy is good in this budget.

Battery: The average battery back up is 6-7days, the battery backup will be 2-3 days if you are using calling function moderately. It takes 1.5 hour to full charge"
8566,4.0,"The overall product is good and very well designed there is every features which is important there is no issue related to its feature and the design of the product was just amazing,slim and very good looking .I faced the issue with it's side button there is not a quick response the button work slow compare to other watch brands"
8567,4.0,"The product is good. Only the calling ringtone is not that good. When the incoming call is ringing voice of the ringtone is so high. I tried to silent that but volume doesn't changed. There should be a facility to make it silent or lower the volume.
I will rate this product as 4 star 🌟🌟🌟🌟"
8568,4.0, Touch is smooth.. belt is soft so it's very comfortable while wearing it for a long time... Affordable Smart Watch in this range with such good features.. calling option is available so one can call using the dail and also pick up the call the voice will come from the watch it self as it has speaker and a mic.. you can sync the contacts also various notification options are available. Overall a great product in this price range.. Quality is superb..
8569,4.0,"Durable and nice watch value for money .
Very satisfied with the performance of the product with long lasting battery ."
8570,4.0,"The watch is value for money. The touchscreen is super responsive and accuracy is good.
Did not expect much from battery life but it did surprise me. I got very good battery life with moderate usage. The call clarity is also very good. Overall very satisfactory experience. The only negative thing i found was the ringtone of the watch which cant be silenced. It is very loud and can irritate you after a while."
8571,4.0,After 3month i am seeing a line in centre. It's ok product to see just time. Silicone belt is itchy not good quality.
8572,4.0,The watch is value for money. The touchscreen is super responsive and accuracy is good. Did not expect much from battery life but it did surprise me. I got very good battery life with moderate usage. The call clarity is also very good
8573,4.0,"I loved the battery life of this watch, it connects very efficiently with the app and tracking is quite efficient"
8574,4.0,"I will recommend that buy the watch in sale when the price drop to ₹1899.
Rest the review is below. (I hope it helps).

Pros.....
1) Look is premium. (10/10)
2) Smooth experience. (9/10)
3) Battery backup is also decent. (8/10)
4) Raise to wake is a responsive (8/10)
5) Sleep tracking is decent. (8/10)

Cons...
6) There are a lot of watch faces in dafit app but half of it is boaring (6/10)

7) Do not have option to silent the calls and also the volume of ringtone can't be decreased (feature is available but do not work). (1/10)

8) The biggest problem that I have faced is that the watch is automatically connected to other device if they have dafit.(My watch was connected to random phones two time) and then they can easily change everything on your watch. In other smartwatch first we have to reset the watch to connect to other device 😑😑.

9) Only vibration for alarm, no sound even after having good speaker. (2/10)

8601,4.0,"First thing is that for the price it's a ""fairly good watch"" i would give it an easy 3.8⭐.
The problem's that I faced using this watch is that the battery of this watch is not really that great, you get a maximum of 3 days and a few hours of battery life. Mind you that I have disabled everything, including the vibration, phone and the brightness reduced to nearly 10%. So if you want a better battery, don't take this. And second is that since this one has a call feature, it has a really annoying and very loud tune that rings when someone calls you and there is no option of muting that ring or any sorts. The rest, like I said 3.8⭐"

8603,4.0,It is overall a good product. The calling quality and speaker quality is good in this budget. It goes 2 days in one go after charging. Slight issue with the button and the screen doesn't lit up when I turn my wrist. Overall it's a good product.
8604,4.0,The watch looks very good and is very easy to operate. The body of the frame is metallic which makes the watch a bit heavy but the quality is very nice. There are few coupons also available in the box which you can redeem and get exciting offers.

8607,4.0,"Well.. I guess u should hope for much at this price point, but still it's good enough for giving u an idea about the actual data.. Like it's not 100% accurate but yeah.. It's okeish.. ✌"
8608,4.0,"This bolt watch is a reasonable product for a daily use. And for phisical fitness, I can give a 4 out of 5 rating ."
8609,4.0,"This watch is amazing and worth it.
It is very economical and in budget watch having numerous features.Need to improve in battery backup thing.
Overall experience is good."
8610,4.0,"The watch looks amazing, metal body gives it a sturdy look and solid feel. the touch interface is very smooth as compared to other watches in same category and it comes with variety of different features"
8611,4.0,At price under 2k... Metal body... Bluetooth calling and most of the smart watch features... The round dial is just a class design...screen quality is good... Best for everyday use
8612,4.0,"I like the quality of watch is very good. And accuracy of sleep, touch screen, and all good. Price is also affordable."
8613,4.0,Just received the product today. At first glance looks good and promising.But yet to explore all of its features. I will update the review after few weeks of use.
8614,4.0,"Writing this review after gifting if to my brother and using for 1 hour. Watch touch screen is awesome, no lag and smooth running. Charging is quite fast. 20 minutes and 20-60% charge. Watch is good looking too. I haven't test the sleep tracking yet. But my bro will surely tell the sleep tracking experience and I'll edit this review. The only bad (actually worst) thing about this watch is that the sensors are fully fake. I tested it on a table and it shows that the table has 78 bpm. If you wear it you will also get the same result. Watch is quite good, you could go for it if you are not looking for a heart beat, SpO2 sensing watch because they are worst."
8615,4.0," I am writing this detailed review after using this product for a week:

Build Quality: It is metal body but not the pure metal material, overall build quality is good.

Screen: Amazing experience with screen, even it is not Amoled display but you will not feel the need as brightness is sufficient when wants to use in Sunlight. Touch is very smooth but you will get scratches on screen easily. Wakeup function was not working initially but worked pretty well after resetting.

Accuracy: Most of the Smartwatches measure ghost reading so this does but overall accuracy is good in this budget.

Battery: The average battery back up is 6-7days, the battery backup will be 2-3 days if you are using calling function moderately. It takes 1.5 hour to full charge"
8616,4.0,"The overall product is good and very well designed there is every features which is important there is no issue related to its feature and the design of the product was just amazing,slim and very good looking .I faced the issue with it's side button there is not a quick response the button work slow compare to other watch brands"
8617,4.0,"The product is good. Only the calling ringtone is not that good. When the incoming call is ringing voice of the ringtone is so high. I tried to silent that but volume doesn't changed. There should be a facility to make it silent or lower the volume.
I will rate this product as 4 star 🌟🌟🌟🌟"
8618,4.0, Touch is smooth.. belt is soft so it's very comfortable while wearing it for a long time... Affordable Smart Watch in this range with such good features.. calling option is available so one can call using the dail and also pick up the call the voice will come from the watch it self as it has speaker and a mic.. you can sync the contacts also various notification options are available. Overall a great product in this price range.. Quality is superb..
8619,4.0,"Durable and nice watch value for money .
Very satisfied with the performance of the product with long lasting battery ."
8620,4.0,"The watch is value for money. The touchscreen is super responsive and accuracy is good.
Did not expect much from battery life but it did surprise me. I got very good battery life with moderate usage. The call clarity is also very good. Overall very satisfactory experience. The only negative thing i found was the ringtone of the watch which cant be silenced. It is very loud and can irritate you after a while."
8621,4.0,After 3month i am seeing a line in centre. It's ok product to see just time. Silicone belt is itchy not good quality.
8622,4.0,The watch is value for money. The touchscreen is super responsive and accuracy is good. Did not expect much from battery life but it did surprise me. I got very good battery life with moderate usage. The call clarity is also very good
8623,4.0,"I loved the battery life of this watch, it connects very efficiently with the app and tracking is quite efficient"
8624,4.0,"I will recommend that buy the watch in sale when the price drop to ₹1899.
Rest the review is below. (I hope it helps).

Pros.....
1) Look is premium. (10/10)
2) Smooth experience. (9/10)
3) Battery backup is also decent. (8/10)
4) Raise to wake is a responsive (8/10)
5) Sleep tracking is decent. (8/10)

Cons...
6) There are a lot of watch faces in dafit app but half of it is boaring (6/10)

7) Do not have option to silent the calls and also the volume of ringtone can't be decreased (feature is available but do not work). (1/10)

8) The biggest problem that I have faced is that the watch is automatically connected to other device if they have dafit.(My watch was connected to random phones two time) and then they can easily change everything on your watch. In other smartwatch first we have to reset the watch to connect to other device 😑😑.

9) Only vibration for alarm, no sound even after having good speaker. (2/10)

Personal suggestion:- If you can spend a bit more then go for FIRE BOLTT rage calling (newly launched) It is better in every aspect but in looks phoenix wins."

8647,4.0,I like all available features of the watch. only suggestion is to have one more feature- find a phone
8648,4.0,"[Update: Sept 29] boAt seems to have heard the feedback 😀 and updated the watch faces. Now there are a few good ones to pick but a slight improvement over the ones the watch earlier had. Bit Impressed. Added one star for it.

Not a very polished product. The fonts are tacky and look ugly in the watch for notification text and caller name text. The watch faces are a lazy design job. No point having 150 watch faces if only 10-20 are good or usable. Rest are useless.
[UPDATE: Oct 11] boAt seems to be on a smartwatch launch spree. And thanks to that, they are constantly updating the phone app and the watch faces. Now you have many good looking watch faces to choose from. So overall, still the Smartwatch UI needs work. But atleast you have good watch faces.

Good:
- Screen quality
- Battery life
- Looks and the metallic frame
- Call clarity
- BT calling at the price
- Reasonably accurate sensors

Bad:
- The UI, fonts - they are all very ugly and tacky. They could have tried to give the Chinese software some makeover. But it is a clearly lazy job by the tech team. A copy paste job to be precise of getting an outsourced software and plastering it with brand logos.
- Restarts randomly when the call is going on on the watch even for 1 min or so.
- Watch faces. Again a job of the design / tech / UI team. BoAt doesn't have a good team of designers and UI guys to really offer simple yet good software features like good watch faces and good watch UI.
- No option to silence a call or reply with quick replies.

Look for Noise Smart Watches in the Same Range. Noise Colorfit Pulse Go Buzz is cheaper and better alternative + has better watch faces and UI and quick reply to notifications and call silence and mute options for lower prices which this watch has clearly missed.

You can go for boAt Wave Call also - It isn't an outright bad watch, but there are better options available for the price.

boAt - If you have a team who reads and wants to improve, get some good UI and design folks in your team. Your products are good, but the UI and design is what the people see and that's what makes them feel good about your products. You have really average UI."
8649,4.0,"boat offer balance products though it is audio or watch catagory.

3. IPS screen is good but can't compare with amoled screen which is available with other brands at same price range
4. No internal storage

9. Didn't test accuracy of the sensors but they do not work on other objects / surfaces except your skin.
9. And more...

Cons:

2. The bezels are big
3. Custom watch faces are useless as the font sizes are really small. The preview on phone app is different from what you see on actual phone.
4. The screen displayes washed out desaturated /pastel colors.

There could be more pros and cons but since I am not using the watch so cannot mention anything else.

8834,4.0," Used this watch for over a month now.. Bought it during the first sale.. Keep reading for an unbiased review and tips/tricks to ensure all the functions in the watch are working smoothly.
1) Large Curved Display in this price category - 1.69 inch
2) Battery with heavy usage and frequently waking up the screen, alexa, alarms, notifications is about 3 days. On standby while just checking the time occassionally is about 8 days. Pretty good. Full charging time is about 1.5 hours. Decent quality magnetic charging cable provided. Use your own low power adapter, power bank or laptop.
3) Has all the necessary health / workout tracking options.. Spo2( Oxymeter), Heart Rate monitor..Accuracy is 95-98%. Sleep tracking is pretty accurate too. Paedometer is accurate most of the times, but sometimes few hundred steps are added randomly without any activity. This happens randomly once in 3-4 days. Stress Monitor is also there but not sure how it's calculated. The sensors aren not fake most probably because if the watch isn't in contact with your skin it will display a warning message and won't display data.
4) Lift to wake up gesture works but with a 1 second delay.. which is manageable. It has Tap to wake functionality too.
5) Works with most popular notifications: Whatsapp, SMS, Facebook, Instagram etc. Can read the entire SMS on watch and most of the other messages unless it's very long.
6) Calls can't be picked up or silenced.. You can only see the caller id and reject the call.
7) BT Music Control, Weather ☁️ update and Alexa are other usable smart features.
8) 50 different watch face are available on the Boat wave app. Some are really good.. You can also have customised wallpapers as watch faces . See the posted pictures.
9) The Boat Wave app is neatly organized and syncs health data without any issues instantly. The app also has assisted GPS functionality which can track your running activities on a map, in case you need that data.
10) The User Interface is smooth.. Please note that it's not laggy. The animations and transitions are a little slow but overall easy to use. Touch screen response is excellent and feels nice.
11) Overall construction is sturdy and feels nice and comfortable to wear it. It has water resistance of 5 ATM.. Can take it for a short duration swim in a pool, under the shower or rain without any worries. Watch uppper body is brushed aluminium and under body is good quality plastic. The straps are soft and also of very good quality. It doesn't irritate your skin even after wearing it for long durations. Four colour options are available with equally matching straps.. Straps can be easily replaced with fancy straps.
12 ) Works both with Android and iPhone flawlessly. Tested on both.

TIPs AND TRICKs ________________________________________

1) Boat wave app needs to run in the background all the time for your call notifications, message notifications, Alexa functionality and Weather updates. If you accidentally clear all the cache and background apps from the phone, the watch will disconnect from the phone after some time when idle ( no active inputs probably after 10-15 mins). Keep the boat wave app running in the background. Most people complaining that the watch frequently disconnected might unintentionally be clearing all the background apps. My watch was continuously connected for 4 straight days without me having to reconnect as long as the boat wave app was running in the background.

2) Alexa on this watch can do a lot of things..It can set your alarms, start the stopwatch, show weather, control Alexa based devices like Echo, wireless lights and AC, work as a simple calculator, translate simple/ short English sentences to German, Spanish, Italian, French and Portugese, get you common stock quotes from internet, can you snippets of general information from the internet in case you don't know something. Yes, Alexa on your watch getting you the information is a little slow, takes about 30 -40 seconds to process your request but it's convenient and better that taking out the phone from your pocket which might take similar amount of time or longer. In my personal experience, Alexa works a little faster on Android as compared to iphone ( maybe 2-3 second difference). Also if there is break while speaking or if there is a long sentence, then it's difficult for Alexa to understand.. Check my video.. Keep it short and you should get the results accurately
3) For Alexa to work properly: After connecting the Boat Wave app with an Amazon account, download the Alexa app and check your Xtend watch is visible under Devices option.
4) To pickup and make calls handsfree without using the phone, just use a Bluetooth headset with voice assistant function. It will work as a charm. The speaker function on most smart watches is useless as it's not convenient for calls while traveling or in a crowded place due to low volume and obviously you don't want everyone to hear your private conversation.. With voice assistant feature on your BT headset you can make a call or play music without having to touch your phone.

Few other functions which could have been provided and is missing. Actually available in many similarly priced devices :
1) Torch 🔦 - Makes the display bright white.. Comes handy in darkness.
2) Remote shutter button for camera.
3) Call silencing option could have been added."

Design, Build & Comfort
When buying a smartwatch, one always thinks about its design and look. Apart from features, design and build is another major aspect one should take care of when buying a smartwatch. The boat has worked on its design this time which brings it to a premium side in terms of look. The design is inspired by the Apple Watch 3, but it cannot be compared to that. Obviously, in every aspect, Apple Watch 3 would be much better than the Boat Xtend Smartwatch. Redmi Watch as well as Amazfit Bip U Pro has the same shape and design, but the build quality is much premium on this one.

Boat Xtend design and build
I personally don’t like the color scheme of this Boat Xtend Smartwatch. The black color variant comes with a golden color metallic frame. I believe the gold color would fade away after some time. There are three other color variants, which also don’t look stylish as this one. However, that is my personal opinion on the color scheme, so maybe you might find the color scheme to be good.

Boat Xtend design
The watch has 5ATM water resistance. It has silicon straps, which are quite comfortable. The straps are good quality straps which you will find comfortable with regular usage.

Display
Coming to the display, the watch has a 42mm square shape display. What you see on this one is a TFT panel. The screen has big bezels, however, the good part is that the screen goes completely back when it is off, so you won’t notice the bezels, and the screen quality won’t feel cheap at all. It doesn’t have an always-on display, but we cannot complain about that. The watch offers a screen on time of up to 20 seconds and up to 12 levels of brightness control.

Boat Xtend display quality
I find the display quality of the Boat Xtend Smartwatch to be better than the previous smartwatch from Boat. View angle is good on this one, and you can clearly see content on this smartwatch even in the sunlight. The color on this one is not very saturated, but this isn’t something that we can complain about in this price range.

Watch UI And Features
The UI of this smartwatch is clean and easy to use. There is a single button on the watch which works as the power/off button as well as the back button. Moreover, the display is a touchscreen display that works without any problem. There isn’t much animation on the bar menu, and the navigation is simple, so you won’t find it difficult to use. However, the watch may lag a bit. The company has done cost-cutting in terms of the processor, that’s why you may find it to lag a bit, but it is OK, and not a big deal at the price point you get it.

Boat Xtend Ui
The watch offers all the basic fitness features such as daily activity (which includes total steps walked, calories burnt, and time), heart rate, sleep tracking, stress tracking breath training, SpO2 training, meditation, find my phone, and music control. Apart from that, there are 14 different support modes on this watch. I tried a few of them, and they worked fine. The watch notifies you of the incoming calls, messages received, and various other notifications in detail.

Boat Xtend smartwatch review
Alexa Support
The main highlight of the Boat Xtend is the Amazon Alexa Support. The watch has an in-built microphone, and you can access it by long-pressing the back button. Do note that you can only do some basic tasks with Alexa on the watch like setting an alarm, setting a timer, and such. Well, it is a good thing to have Alexa on a watch, but you won’t find it very useful. Probably you will use it for a day or two out of excitement, and then you won’t prefer using it because it only does some basic tasks. So, even if Boat missed this feature, it won’t be a problem.

Boat Xtend Alexa support
Watch Faces
The next cool thing about this Boat Smartwatch is the watch faces you get on this one. You get more than 100 watch faces on the watch, and probably more watch faces will be added to it. Moreover, you can also set a custom watch face as well.

Boat Xtend watch faces
Boat Wave App
You will have to download the Boat Wave App to use the watch. The app is available for both Android as well as iOS devices. You won’t be seeing bugs on the app, and it works perfectly. I haven’t noticed any problem with connectivity like frequent disconnection. The interface of the Boat Wave is clean and simple. You will get all the fitness-related options and all the watch settings on the app itself.

Accuracy
Accuracy is one of the important aspects that one should take care of when buying a smartwatch. So talking about the accuracy, I tested everything on this watch, from normal walking to running, sleeping, and much more, and I find the results to be accurate.

Boat Xtend accuracy test
Compared to Realme or Redmi Watch, the result was the same on all of them. So, there is no problem with the accuracy. I don’t find the results to be accurate on most of the budget fitness trackers, but yes, this smartwatch is accurate in terms of fitness tracking, sleep tracking, and everything it does.

Boat Xtend accuracy
Comparing it to the Noise watch which we tried recently, the stress level as well as the SpO2 tracking is much more accurate on this one. It also has the option to track the menstrual cycle in women.

Boat Xtend accuracy
Battery
You get to see a 300mAH battery on this one, which the company claims to last 7 days. However, if you use most of the features of the watch, then the battery will last about two and a half days. If you keep the brightness low, then the battery will last about 3-4 days. I find the battery life to be a downside of the watch. It comes with magnet hook charging support.

Final Words
Boat Xtend Smartwatch is a decent smartwatch from the Boat. It offers all the basic fitness features you will find on a budget fitness tracker, a good display, Alexa support, good design and build, and much more. The smartwatch at this price is quite good. Personally, what I didn’t like about this smartwatch is its color scheme. However, if you like the color scheme, then I would recommend you to go for it. Overall the watch is good with nothing to dislike about it except for the battery life. The battery life on this one is quite low. The company claims it to have a battery life of 7 days, but with regular usage, it will last for 2-3 days. If you are looking for a good smartwatch under Rs.5000, and you can adjust with the battery life, and you like the color scheme, then I would recommend you to go for this smartwatch. It offers all the features that should be there in a smartwatch under Rs.5000."
8836,4.0,"Pros:

1. Premium build quality with matte finishing- sturdy polycarbonate frame, good soft silicone straps that r absolutely flush with the body of the watch. Attractive, trendy colours.
2. Heart Rate (except heart rate spikes in weight training), Pedometer(steps counter) are accurate but SPO2 is off by +/- 2% when compared to Pulse Oximeter readings. But most smart watches offer the same accuracy. Sleep tracking is accurate only for bed time & wake up time, duration but stages of sleep are inaccurate. Light, deep sleep, waking detected but no REM sleep detected. Sleep data from the watch synchronises smoothly with Boat Wave app. Issues warning msg if watch not worn on hand properly and does not detect data of surfaces.
3. Large (1.69""), clear bright, sharp LCD IPS display even in the sun.
4. Touch not smooth, experienced jitters. UI also lags at times & after attaching the tempered glass sometimes some functions require 02-03 taps to work. But acceptable scrolling response if finger moved diagonally instead of vertically.
5. In app GPS works superbly. Excellent route tracking on the map. This feature is not advertised in their description.
6. Bluetooth 5.0 connectivity is good if mobile is kept in close proximity(7m). The Boat Wave app must remain running in the background at all times.
7. Definitely splash proof though did'nt take the risk of submerging the watch.
8. All notifications are working, no problem with call alerts or SMS msgs or social media app notifications. No lags at all though there is provision for a 3 sec lag which can be turned on.
9. Alexa works superbly but since there is no speaker, info is displayed on the screen. My Wipro Smart Bulb, FireTV stick can be controlled easily using the inbuilt Alexa on the watch. Alexa can do mathematical calculations, currency conversions, even foreign language translations, apart from supplying info on anything under the sun. But ofcourse, Alexa cannot make calls. Alexa can set alarm, timer also.
10. Sedentary alert, drinking water reminder, stress alert, menstrual cycle alert, alarms, timers function well.
11. Boat Wave app connects easily & no lags observed. Data syncs smoothly with Google Fit app. Excellent health reports and motivational rewards system in the form of badges. But settings can be changed only through the app and the watch needs to be restarted for the new settings to be effective.
12. Training, Sports modes r good.
13. Guided Breathing mode is also good.
14. Find my phone works well.
15. Extremely stylish, light weight & comfortable for all day wear.
16. 07 watch faces available in the device with 04 preset which cannot be deleted. The rest can be changed from the Boat Wave app.

Cons:

1. Lacks vibration intensity control.
2. Lacks Camera control shutter. But can't figure out its use as my handset accepts both voice commands & gestures to click pics.
3. No quick reply messages for notifications/call alerts.
4. No call acceptance or silencing feature. A work around can be if bluetooth handset is connected at the same time.
5. SPO2 is not accurate and sometimes freezes at 97%. But this is common in all smart watches.
6. Battery does'nt last more than 03 days if continuous HR measurement is turned on. Otherwise easily lasts for 7 days.
7. Watch faces are very childish. Expected better quality designs. Company can easily improve on this in their next update.
8. Amazon Prime only replacement, no refund policy is not good. At least colour change should be allowed once.
9. Music control feature does not display the title of the song.
10. No BP monitoring or temperature monitoring feature. Smart watches usually do not provide reliable BP data.
11. No calling feature. But it does'nt matter as most don't want conversations to be public.
12. A bit large for narrow wrists, band @22 mm is a bit wide.
13. Company should provide a tempered glass protector. No mention of protective glass on the display mentioned. Have attached a Scot tempered glass purchased separately.
14. There are actually only 10 sports modes. Boat has bloated the list with Indoor-Outdoor combi of 4 sports (Walking, Running, Swimming, Cycling).
15. There is no light sensor. Auto brightness is only time dependant but works well.

Was a wedding anniversary gift for my wife who liked it very much even the colour- the evergreen, classic gold-black. Overall the best smart watch with Alexa built in, available at the budget price point of under Rs 3000. An excellent Fitness Tracker but average Health Monitor."
8837,4.0,"First I want to tell.
1.The watch want to update first either it will not work, so it reqest to seller to check the product before selling.

2. The product is very good and satisfied according to price.

4. But seller should check the product before selling to customers.

5. Coz I had return it first then after I recived it, it better coz the device is not updated.

8871,4.0,"Alexa is not works in it, This is bad whats the importance of giving it."
8872,4.0,"I have received this product a couple of days ago and now I am going to give an honest review of it.

This product is a great item if you are looking for a budget smartwatch. For its price, it provides quite accurate measurements of your BPM, stress, SPO2 etc. I have verified it's measurements with an actual oximeter and it proved to be accurate. However, the pedometer of the watch randomly adds around 100 steps. The pedometer is accurate otherwise.

The touch display of the 1.69"" watch impressed me. The watch has a sharp display, and smooth touch, which makes you feel like you are on a smartphone. The response time is quite well too. However, the animations lag which is not very eye pleasing, but workable.

The battery is great. The watch would be powered on for one whole night and would not lose a single percent of battery. Even while using, it loses a reasonable amount of power. For first time users, who just received their product: You might notice the battery is draining extremely quick. Do not panic. It is recommended to charge the battery for at least 2 hours before first use. It stabilizes the battery. The next time you use your watch, it would work as normal.

The built-in Alexa is perhaps my favorite feature of this watch. It's response time is around 5 seconds, and is quite fun to use a virtual assistant on the go. It can tell you facts, jokes, weather, calculations, translations and loads of other stuff, which might be useful for quickly looking up something. However, Alexa does not have a speaker. It gives a text output. The text output can sometimes end with ""..."" (ellipses) which mean the output is too long to print. It can also fail to provide relevant output at times.
You need to log in to Alexa with your Amazon account in the boAt Wave App.

There are 100+ watch faces in the wave app, which you can use to customize your watch with whatever that suits your personality. You can even use your own pictures. However, you cannot customize the time font if you choose to do that, which, in my opinion, is quite limiting.

Notifications in the watch is pretty cool, and comes in handy when you do not wish to open your phone for it. Call alerts come, and you can reject them but not accept. Makes sense as the watch does not have a speaker. It vibrates.

It has a good build quality and is water-resistant.

Other cool features are sleep tracking, breathing exercise, alarms, timers, flashlights etc.

Overall, a pretty decent watch if you are looking for something in this range of price."
8873,4.0,Good battery 🔋 bkup.....also u can rec. Notification of whtup nd insta etc on screen
8874,4.0,Everything is good but once bluetooth connection disconnected then it won't connect automatically.. 😒
8875,4.0, Like as it shows time for what I ordered it
8876,4.0,"It's over all a good product. Battery runs 7 days non-stop after fully charged. Notifications work. Screen movement is not fluid don't expect at this price. But its still overpriced because these functions are available with other brands with lower range. I bought for 2999. So depends on you.
Works fine even in dusty or heavy rainfall. Belt quality is really sturdy. Screen glass is very good quality, almost many times I hit railings or equipments. I work in such environment. No scratches at all.
I'm satisfied with the tracking and sensors. Almost 95% accuracy.
I just wish manufacturers give an option of switching off the Bluetooth on the watch when not needed, just a food for thought."
8877,4.0,"Good product, I liked. Worth for the money,

8880,4.0,Watch is good but calling feature is not that good can be neglected looking at price.
8881,4.0,Nice product
8882,4.0,"I am a very huge fan of boat especially there service and warranty they never let their customers down asusual good

One tip - Dont use too much of watch faces in the app it has less storage so u avoid lag in a watch"
8883,4.0,"For the price it is good, looks pretty, but poor accuracy"
8884,4.0," Used this watch for over a month now.. Bought it during the first sale.. Keep reading for an unbiased review and tips/tricks to ensure all the functions in the watch are working smoothly.
1) Large Curved Display in this price category - 1.69 inch
2) Battery with heavy usage and frequently waking up the screen, alexa, alarms, notifications is about 3 days. On standby while just checking the time occassionally is about 8 days. Pretty good. Full charging time is about 1.5 hours. Decent quality magnetic charging cable provided. Use your own low power adapter, power bank or laptop.
3) Has all the necessary health / workout tracking options.. Spo2( Oxymeter), Heart Rate monitor..Accuracy is 95-98%. Sleep tracking is pretty accurate too. Paedometer is accurate most of the times, but sometimes few hundred steps are added randomly without any activity. This happens randomly once in 3-4 days. Stress Monitor is also there but not sure how it's calculated. The sensors aren not fake most probably because if the watch isn't in contact with your skin it will display a warning message and won't display data.
4) Lift to wake up gesture works but with a 1 second delay.. which is manageable. It has Tap to wake functionality too.
5) Works with most popular notifications: Whatsapp, SMS, Facebook, Instagram etc. Can read the entire SMS on watch and most of the other messages unless it's very long.
6) Calls can't be picked up or silenced.. You can only see the caller id and reject the call.
7) BT Music Control, Weather ☁️ update and Alexa are other usable smart features.
8) 50 different watch face are available on the Boat wave app. Some are really good.. You can also have customised wallpapers as watch faces . See the posted pictures.
9) The Boat Wave app is neatly organized and syncs health data without any issues instantly. The app also has assisted GPS functionality which can track your running activities on a map, in case you need that data.
10) The User Interface is smooth.. Please note that it's not laggy. The animations and transitions are a little slow but overall easy to use. Touch screen response is excellent and feels nice.
11) Overall construction is sturdy and feels nice and comfortable to wear it. It has water resistance of 5 ATM.. Can take it for a short duration swim in a pool, under the shower or rain without any worries. Watch uppper body is brushed aluminium and under body is good quality plastic. The straps are soft and also of very good quality. It doesn't irritate your skin even after wearing it for long durations. Four colour options are available with equally matching straps.. Straps can be easily replaced with fancy straps.
12 ) Works both with Android and iPhone flawlessly. Tested on both.

TIPs AND TRICKs ________________________________________

1) Boat wave app needs to run in the background all the time for your call notifications, message notifications, Alexa functionality and Weather updates. If you accidentally clear all the cache and background apps from the phone, the watch will disconnect from the phone after some time when idle ( no active inputs probably after 10-15 mins). Keep the boat wave app running in the background. Most people complaining that the watch frequently disconnected might unintentionally be clearing all the background apps. My watch was continuously connected for 4 straight days without me having to reconnect as long as the boat wave app was running in the background.

2) Alexa on this watch can do a lot of things..It can set your alarms, start the stopwatch, show weather, control Alexa based devices like Echo, wireless lights and AC, work as a simple calculator, translate simple/ short English sentences to German, Spanish, Italian, French and Portugese, get you common stock quotes from internet, can you snippets of general information from the internet in case you don't know something. Yes, Alexa on your watch getting you the information is a little slow, takes about 30 -40 seconds to process your request but it's convenient and better that taking out the phone from your pocket which might take similar amount of time or longer. In my personal experience, Alexa works a little faster on Android as compared to iphone ( maybe 2-3 second difference). Also if there is break while speaking or if there is a long sentence, then it's difficult for Alexa to understand.. Check my video.. Keep it short and you should get the results accurately
3) For Alexa to work properly: After connecting the Boat Wave app with an Amazon account, download the Alexa app and check your Xtend watch is visible under Devices option.
4) To pickup and make calls handsfree without using the phone, just use a Bluetooth headset with voice assistant function. It will work as a charm. The speaker function on most smart watches is useless as it's not convenient for calls while traveling or in a crowded place due to low volume and obviously you don't want everyone to hear your private conversation.. With voice assistant feature on your BT headset you can make a call or play music without having to touch your phone.

Few other functions which could have been provided and is missing. Actually available in many similarly priced devices :
1) Torch 🔦 - Makes the display bright white.. Comes handy in darkness.
2) Remote shutter button for camera.
3) Call silencing option could have been added."

Design, Build & Comfort
When buying a smartwatch, one always thinks about its design and look. Apart from features, design and build is another major aspect one should take care of when buying a smartwatch. The boat has worked on its design this time which brings it to a premium side in terms of look. The design is inspired by the Apple Watch 3, but it cannot be compared to that. Obviously, in every aspect, Apple Watch 3 would be much better than the Boat Xtend Smartwatch. Redmi Watch as well as Amazfit Bip U Pro has the same shape and design, but the build quality is much premium on this one.

Boat Xtend design and build
I personally don’t like the color scheme of this Boat Xtend Smartwatch. The black color variant comes with a golden color metallic frame. I believe the gold color would fade away after some time. There are three other color variants, which also don’t look stylish as this one. However, that is my personal opinion on the color scheme, so maybe you might find the color scheme to be good.

Boat Xtend design
The watch has 5ATM water resistance. It has silicon straps, which are quite comfortable. The straps are good quality straps which you will find comfortable with regular usage.

Display
Coming to the display, the watch has a 42mm square shape display. What you see on this one is a TFT panel. The screen has big bezels, however, the good part is that the screen goes completely back when it is off, so you won’t notice the bezels, and the screen quality won’t feel cheap at all. It doesn’t have an always-on display, but we cannot complain about that. The watch offers a screen on time of up to 20 seconds and up to 12 levels of brightness control.

Boat Xtend display quality
I find the display quality of the Boat Xtend Smartwatch to be better than the previous smartwatch from Boat. View angle is good on this one, and you can clearly see content on this smartwatch even in the sunlight. The color on this one is not very saturated, but this isn’t something that we can complain about in this price range.

Watch UI And Features
The UI of this smartwatch is clean and easy to use. There is a single button on the watch which works as the power/off button as well as the back button. Moreover, the display is a touchscreen display that works without any problem. There isn’t much animation on the bar menu, and the navigation is simple, so you won’t find it difficult to use. However, the watch may lag a bit. The company has done cost-cutting in terms of the processor, that’s why you may find it to lag a bit, but it is OK, and not a big deal at the price point you get it.

Boat Xtend Ui
The watch offers all the basic fitness features such as daily activity (which includes total steps walked, calories burnt, and time), heart rate, sleep tracking, stress tracking breath training, SpO2 training, meditation, find my phone, and music control. Apart from that, there are 14 different support modes on this watch. I tried a few of them, and they worked fine. The watch notifies you of the incoming calls, messages received, and various other notifications in detail.

Boat Xtend smartwatch review
Alexa Support
The main highlight of the Boat Xtend is the Amazon Alexa Support. The watch has an in-built microphone, and you can access it by long-pressing the back button. Do note that you can only do some basic tasks with Alexa on the watch like setting an alarm, setting a timer, and such. Well, it is a good thing to have Alexa on a watch, but you won’t find it very useful. Probably you will use it for a day or two out of excitement, and then you won’t prefer using it because it only does some basic tasks. So, even if Boat missed this feature, it won’t be a problem.

Boat Xtend Alexa support
Watch Faces
The next cool thing about this Boat Smartwatch is the watch faces you get on this one. You get more than 100 watch faces on the watch, and probably more watch faces will be added to it. Moreover, you can also set a custom watch face as well.

Boat Xtend watch faces
Boat Wave App
You will have to download the Boat Wave App to use the watch. The app is available for both Android as well as iOS devices. You won’t be seeing bugs on the app, and it works perfectly. I haven’t noticed any problem with connectivity like frequent disconnection. The interface of the Boat Wave is clean and simple. You will get all the fitness-related options and all the watch settings on the app itself.

Accuracy
Accuracy is one of the important aspects that one should take care of when buying a smartwatch. So talking about the accuracy, I tested everything on this watch, from normal walking to running, sleeping, and much more, and I find the results to be accurate.

Boat Xtend accuracy test
Compared to Realme or Redmi Watch, the result was the same on all of them. So, there is no problem with the accuracy. I don’t find the results to be accurate on most of the budget fitness trackers, but yes, this smartwatch is accurate in terms of fitness tracking, sleep tracking, and everything it does.

Boat Xtend accuracy
Comparing it to the Noise watch which we tried recently, the stress level as well as the SpO2 tracking is much more accurate on this one. It also has the option to track the menstrual cycle in women.

Boat Xtend accuracy
Battery
You get to see a 300mAH battery on this one, which the company claims to last 7 days. However, if you use most of the features of the watch, then the battery will last about two and a half days. If you keep the brightness low, then the battery will last about 3-4 days. I find the battery life to be a downside of the watch. It comes with magnet hook charging support.

Final Words
Boat Xtend Smartwatch is a decent smartwatch from the Boat. It offers all the basic fitness features you will find on a budget fitness tracker, a good display, Alexa support, good design and build, and much more. The smartwatch at this price is quite good. Personally, what I didn’t like about this smartwatch is its color scheme. However, if you like the color scheme, then I would recommend you to go for it. Overall the watch is good with nothing to dislike about it except for the battery life. The battery life on this one is quite low. The company claims it to have a battery life of 7 days, but with regular usage, it will last for 2-3 days. If you are looking for a good smartwatch under Rs.5000, and you can adjust with the battery life, and you like the color scheme, then I would recommend you to go for this smartwatch. It offers all the features that should be there in a smartwatch under Rs.5000."
8886,4.0,"Pros:

1. Premium build quality with matte finishing- sturdy polycarbonate frame, good soft silicone straps that r absolutely flush with the body of the watch. Attractive, trendy colours.
2. Heart Rate (except heart rate spikes in weight training), Pedometer(steps counter) are accurate but SPO2 is off by +/- 2% when compared to Pulse Oximeter readings. But most smart watches offer the same accuracy. Sleep tracking is accurate only for bed time & wake up time, duration but stages of sleep are inaccurate. Light, deep sleep, waking detected but no REM sleep detected. Sleep data from the watch synchronises smoothly with Boat Wave app. Issues warning msg if watch not worn on hand properly and does not detect data of surfaces.
3. Large (1.69""), clear bright, sharp LCD IPS display even in the sun.
4. Touch not smooth, experienced jitters. UI also lags at times & after attaching the tempered glass sometimes some functions require 02-03 taps to work. But acceptable scrolling response if finger moved diagonally instead of vertically.
5. In app GPS works superbly. Excellent route tracking on the map. This feature is not advertised in their description.
6. Bluetooth 5.0 connectivity is good if mobile is kept in close proximity(7m). The Boat Wave app must remain running in the background at all times.
7. Definitely splash proof though did'nt take the risk of submerging the watch.
8. All notifications are working, no problem with call alerts or SMS msgs or social media app notifications. No lags at all though there is provision for a 3 sec lag which can be turned on.
9. Alexa works superbly but since there is no speaker, info is displayed on the screen. My Wipro Smart Bulb, FireTV stick can be controlled easily using the inbuilt Alexa on the watch. Alexa can do mathematical calculations, currency conversions, even foreign language translations, apart from supplying info on anything under the sun. But ofcourse, Alexa cannot make calls. Alexa can set alarm, timer also.
10. Sedentary alert, drinking water reminder, stress alert, menstrual cycle alert, alarms, timers function well.
11. Boat Wave app connects easily & no lags observed. Data syncs smoothly with Google Fit app. Excellent health reports and motivational rewards system in the form of badges. But settings can be changed only through the app and the watch needs to be restarted for the new settings to be effective.
12. Training, Sports modes r good.
13. Guided Breathing mode is also good.
14. Find my phone works well.
15. Extremely stylish, light weight & comfortable for all day wear.
16. 07 watch faces available in the device with 04 preset which cannot be deleted. The rest can be changed from the Boat Wave app.

Cons:

1. Lacks vibration intensity control.
2. Lacks Camera control shutter. But can't figure out its use as my handset accepts both voice commands & gestures to click pics.
3. No quick reply messages for notifications/call alerts.
4. No call acceptance or silencing feature. A work around can be if bluetooth handset is connected at the same time.
5. SPO2 is not accurate and sometimes freezes at 97%. But this is common in all smart watches.
6. Battery does'nt last more than 03 days if continuous HR measurement is turned on. Otherwise easily lasts for 7 days.
7. Watch faces are very childish. Expected better quality designs. Company can easily improve on this in their next update.
8. Amazon Prime only replacement, no refund policy is not good. At least colour change should be allowed once.
9. Music control feature does not display the title of the song.
10. No BP monitoring or temperature monitoring feature. Smart watches usually do not provide reliable BP data.
11. No calling feature. But it does'nt matter as most don't want conversations to be public.
12. A bit large for narrow wrists, band @22 mm is a bit wide.
13. Company should provide a tempered glass protector. No mention of protective glass on the display mentioned. Have attached a Scot tempered glass purchased separately.
14. There are actually only 10 sports modes. Boat has bloated the list with Indoor-Outdoor combi of 4 sports (Walking, Running, Swimming, Cycling).
15. There is no light sensor. Auto brightness is only time dependant but works well.

Was a wedding anniversary gift for my wife who liked it very much even the colour- the evergreen, classic gold-black. Overall the best smart watch with Alexa built in, available at the budget price point of under Rs 3000. An excellent Fitness Tracker but average Health Monitor."

8895,4.0,"While it seems very appealing but pl mind that functions are very limited and practically you can't use many. Also there's no voice calling or Alexa voice support though you can give give voice command. Limited use, not very great product i will say."
8896,4.0,Before buying this product look the video in Youtube as in this Xtend there is no calling function available. Overall product is good but and however the application which used to connect Xtend is BoatWave is also large in size.
8897,4.0,Value for money
8898,4.0,"I've been using this for 45 days or so and overall it's very good purchase for me..The sleep tracker is accurate, the heart rate is accurate,stress level monitor works well, the oxygen level travels around 96 to 98 in my case and I'm not quite sure whether it's accurate or not..Keeping this aside there are several things..You are provided with 150+ watch faces however you can install 2 watch faces from the app at a time in the watch and 1 customised watch face in which you can add your own picture..The touch screen lags a lot..Weather is only updated when the phone is near you and is connected with bluetooth and location..Same with alexa and music controls..If you keep brightness at level 1 then the battery lasts upto 15 days..Glass will easily get scratches which will ruin it's look...It has flashlight(torch) which helps a lot..If you are away from your phone then only time, heartrate, stress level, spo2 level, alarm, timer, sports mode and steps,calories,distance travelled works..Alexa obviously along with weather, music controls do not work without your phone near you that is connected to internet bluetooth and location...Overall it's a good purchase at this price point."

The replacement process was simple and easy … thank god n thanks to Amazon"
8921,4.0,"Alexa is not works in it, This is bad whats the importance of giving it."
8922,4.0,"I have received this product a couple of days ago and now I am going to give an honest review of it.

This product is a great item if you are looking for a budget smartwatch. For its price, it provides quite accurate measurements of your BPM, stress, SPO2 etc. I have verified it's measurements with an actual oximeter and it proved to be accurate. However, the pedometer of the watch randomly adds around 100 steps. The pedometer is accurate otherwise.

The touch display of the 1.69"" watch impressed me. The watch has a sharp display, and smooth touch, which makes you feel like you are on a smartphone. The response time is quite well too. However, the animations lag which is not very eye pleasing, but workable.

The battery is great. The watch would be powered on for one whole night and would not lose a single percent of battery. Even while using, it loses a reasonable amount of power. For first time users, who just received their product: You might notice the battery is draining extremely quick. Do not panic. It is recommended to charge the battery for at least 2 hours before first use. It stabilizes the battery. The next time you use your watch, it would work as normal.

The built-in Alexa is perhaps my favorite feature of this watch. It's response time is around 5 seconds, and is quite fun to use a virtual assistant on the go. It can tell you facts, jokes, weather, calculations, translations and loads of other stuff, which might be useful for quickly looking up something. However, Alexa does not have a speaker. It gives a text output. The text output can sometimes end with ""..."" (ellipses) which mean the output is too long to print. It can also fail to provide relevant output at times.
You need to log in to Alexa with your Amazon account in the boAt Wave App.

There are 100+ watch faces in the wave app, which you can use to customize your watch with whatever that suits your personality. You can even use your own pictures. However, you cannot customize the time font if you choose to do that, which, in my opinion, is quite limiting.

Notifications in the watch is pretty cool, and comes in handy when you do not wish to open your phone for it. Call alerts come, and you can reject them but not accept. Makes sense as the watch does not have a speaker. It vibrates.

It has a good build quality and is water-resistant.

Other cool features are sleep tracking, breathing exercise, alarms, timers, flashlights etc.

Overall, a pretty decent watch if you are looking for something in this range of price."
8923,4.0,Good battery 🔋 bkup.....also u can rec. Notification of whtup nd insta etc on screen
8924,4.0,Everything is good but once bluetooth connection disconnected then it won't connect automatically.. 😒
8925,4.0, Like as it shows time for what I ordered it
8926,4.0,"It's over all a good product. Battery runs 7 days non-stop after fully charged. Notifications work. Screen movement is not fluid don't expect at this price. But its still overpriced because these functions are available with other brands with lower range. I bought for 2999. So depends on you.
Works fine even in dusty or heavy rainfall. Belt quality is really sturdy. Screen glass is very good quality, almost many times I hit railings or equipments. I work in such environment. No scratches at all.
I'm satisfied with the tracking and sensors. Almost 95% accuracy.
I just wish manufacturers give an option of switching off the Bluetooth on the watch when not needed, just a food for thought."
8927,4.0,"Good product, I liked. Worth for the money,
Good battery life"
8928,4.0,Product is good for regular use. Nice looking watch. Shouldn’t expect much at this price point.

8930,4.0,Watch is good but calling feature is not that good can be neglected looking at price.
8931,4.0,Nice product
8932,4.0,"I am a very huge fan of boat especially there service and warranty they never let their customers down asusual good

One tip - Dont use too much of watch faces in the app it has less storage so u avoid lag in a watch"

8934,4.0,"REVIEW OF AMAZFIT GTS 2 Mini Smart watch (2021 model)

Hello everyone . Since the new model of amazfit GTS2 mini arrived , i am going to review the old model of it

Pros:

Display : 1.55 inch amoled display , really good look . ( pros)

Battery : coming with 220 maH , from 100 percent to 13 percent it takes 10 days to drain and it was expected to last 1 day longer ( normal use ) . But If you are a light user ,it can last it for 14 days . (Pro)

IP rating :IP 68 water resistant which is cool .(Pro)

Heartbeat sensor : It has heartbeat sensor and it is real , but it may not show real accuracy at all the time . But it performs good (pro)

Comfortness : It is really comfortable wearing this watch and the band is silicone material. (pro)

Work out modes : There are nearly 70+ workout modes and i tested out some , since it is built in GPS , it works nearly accurate but the measure is not that much accurate but it works well. (pro)

can track stress

Has PAI feature to progress your workout with better experience

Alexa assistant ( but need phone connection to activate this )

Has other modes like breathing ,menstrual cycle tracking,to-do-list , inbuilt alarm ,pomodoro timer ,sleep tracker ,Timer , In built compass , camera remote ,find the phone , controlling music etc.

Notification system : you can get notifications .

Call control system : You can accept or reject calls , but you cannot able to talk through watch.

Cons:

Build quality :it is told that this watch is completly aluminium frame but it is quite disappointing that only half frame is gun metal aluminium . and half is poly carbonate (con) .

Watch faces : the inbuilt watch faces are quite depressing at initial impressions but there are some watch faces that are really good . (con)

SPO2 : I don't know how much accurate it is , but coming to technical part , the sensors are failing most of the times . Sometimes cannot able to sync workout history .(con)

Verdict :

It is not a bad idea to spend money for this watch due to immense features and real sensors but you should compromise on sensors efficiency and build quality ."
8935,4.0,"Original 3rd Jan 2021: This is my first smartwatch. I have bought a couple of Honor fitness bands earlier for family, but this is my personal first. I have been keenly following the smartwatch space for the last 10 months or so and I'm aware of most of the products in the budget range. While I can afford a slightly more expensive one (GTS2/GTR2 or Honor GT2 Pro, Oppo Watch, Fitbit etc) with calling feature, I wanted to get the feel of a smartwatch in the budget range first. I gave a lot of thought and finally bought this one as it included GPS and Amazon Alexa (yet to be included, but must be available through an OTA update). I'd have loved to buy Amazfit Bip U Pro as it has almost the same features with an LCD display (has GPS and Alexa in the global version named Amazfit Pop Pro). It still isn't released in India.
Coming to the watch's performance, the typical features I tried today (first day) are Heart RATE (HR), SPO2, Stress monitoring and GPS. I have a pulse oximeter from Dr. Trust at home and so I could compare the HR and SPO2. The numbers on the watch aren't very accurate to my surprise (heart rate variation by 5-10 bpm and SPO2 percentage off by 10% points at times) . But I still feel it's more to do with calibration and the way these numbers are measured than inaccuracy of the hardware etc. GPS was a breeze as I walked on the terrace of my rural town house. It won't surprise me if I don't get the same performance in a metro city with a lot of high rise apartments etc. The compass worked fine when I compared it with my phone. Music controls worked fine, bluetooth data transfer or sync was good. I couldn't control the phone camera as I couldn't get that feature to work (refer to image and help me if you can). I didn't face any issue with watch vibration during calls and app notifications. The readability on the watch screen has been really good. Tried a couple of workouts. While the step count seems to be fine, not sure of the accuracy of the stats on other workout modes.
To conclude, I wouldn't say that this watch is a disappointment, but it needs improvements on the accuracy of the fitness stats. Probably I should give it more time, but fitness brands have done better in terms of accuracy (at least the Honor bands I've seen). Eagerly waiting for Alexa update as I'm curious what all it can do.
I would love to update my review after using the watch for few more days. Let's see.
Update (8th Jan 2021): The battery is a clear disappointment as many other users pointed out. I'm hardly getting it for 3.5 days with always on display and an occasional workout. Limited watch faces, both on device (4) and the app (57). Not many out of these 57 do justice to the good display. Waterproof nature of the device is good. I didn't dip it in water, but it got wet when I was bathing my kids and it seems to have a waterproof coating which was in action. I got the camera shutter to work. I hope Amazfit provides updates to fix battery drain and enable Alexa. Notifications didn't have an issue, but could not clear individual items (clear all worked)"
8936,4.0,"Reviewing after one month of using
Something that not mentioned

Sensors - BioTracker 2 PPG sensor, movement acceleration sensor, geomagnetic sensor,gyroscope sensor,ambient light sensor and SpO2 sensor.

Pros
1.Display and design (sleek and slim) and good to see
2. Accuracy is fantastic strongly recommend if you are looking for fitness.
3. Sensors
4. Alexa,it's really a fun and useful thing to use, remember this device only has mic NO SPEAKER . so Alexa response only in text format.
5. Most of the controls are done in watch itself

Cons
1. Battery life is average, if you turn oned everything ,it will be last for 2-3 days. Not more than that

2. Software is okish but need a little bit improvement but it's ok

3. Build quality is average beacusue it easyly get scratch

4. This watch DOES NOT HAVE SPEAKERS so if you are looking for bluetooth calling. You can't do this in this watch,
But how many of them use watches for calling. Think once if you need blutooth calling.
5. Highly Recommended to apply a good tempered glass

I will attach few proof of pros and cons please check it.
In accuracy I have compared with actual medical devices.
For further information about this product check in official website. Beacusue in amazon few things were not mentioned.

Conclusion: It's a good for one who looking for fitness
But it's not ok for one who looking for more features in it.
Like bluetooth calling,games, speakers etc.

4). I Think alex is not that usefull in this watch,
5).battery backup is not that great as mentioned 14days battery life it give max to max 4-5 days if you are moderated user of like sports mode ,sleep tracking,heart rate and all
6) zepp app can be improved
7) overall nice product in terms of looking,feels premium ness , accuracy in sensors,display"
8938,4.0,"I think at this price, they should have provided calling facility. Also the size is quite small."
8939,4.0,"the watch itself looks pretty good. looks like an apple watch series type.
the step tracking is pretty good. however, it catches simple movements of hands and adds it as a step. it counted 12 steps when i was sitting. Touch feedbad is sometimes slow but works most of the time. Alexa doesn't listen properly [you have to go to the alexa screen for any command it wont listen to you if you're on any other screen or if the watch is close] by the time u swipe to the alexa screen, its better to do that task yourself so i found that pretty useless. obviously as it comes, spo2 is also inaccurate and stress levels are quite accurate. [don't expect spo2 to be right even in 10k watches]
Sleep tracking is pretty good. and it has tons of excercise options you can choose from.
Fitness -
it has tones of exercise options, it calculate the amount of calories your burn, your heart rate, kilometers you ran/walked for. you can set a goal in the watch and work out accordingly. It also calculates the calories you consume. 10/10 for the fitness part of the watch
Comfort-
it's surprisingly super lightweight. for the amount of features it has its very very light. however, the strap looks kinda cheap and it leaves red marks on the wrist and is quite itchy. [shown in the pic]
Overall-
for those looking for a watch under 6k, this is your best choice. for the strap itching maybe you can change it. its pretty good all around for the price."
8940,4.0,Good watch but Bluetooth call missing in this price range and company should provide screen protector with it or make scratch proof screen .. that's it
8941,4.0,"Snoozing the reminder not work properly, it's show all the reminder at 1 time not as we schedule."
8942,4.0,"This has been working as my regular watch that provides me data regarding my sleep and activity at the end of the day. Also helps in setting up alarm, creating shopping etc. with the use of Alexa. This does not measure activity automatically. You need to add the workout choice for it to keep a record."
8943,4.0,"These are some pros and cons according to me and then I'll share my opinion.
Pros :-
1. The Display is literally amazing.
2. It looks premium.
3. Stress, Sleep monitoring, SpO2, Heart rate wrorks well (still not recommended in medical emergency, it's not accurate but close to it)
4. For females, Period cycle tracking is a useful option.
5. The work out options that this watch provides it enough.
6. It supports alexa, with which you can command your alexa supported devices like Tv, lights and more.. Also it shows weather reports.
7. The touch response is smooth.
8. It can control music options like play, pause, next, go back. Connects well with ear buds.
9. The display size is small but it looks very good on my wrist.
10. It is completely water proof.

Cons :-
1. The price of the watch seems high according to the watch. (If you get this watch under 5k then it's worth spending the money)
2. Battery. The battery lasts only 3-4 days even if you turn off AOD and not use the watch that much. (I would say the battery could have been better as we are spending 6k which is not a low price at all for a middle class.)
3. There is no calling option ( you can only get to know who's calling and can cut the call, According to me the calling option is not that important I mean it's super weird talking on a watch.)
4. If you're looking for a bigger display then you should avoid this product. (Like I said the display is amazing and looks good in my perspective, but it's not a big display)

My opinion :-
So the main problem for me is the Battery, It only gives me 3 days back up which is not satisfying me, I even don't use AOD but it's still 3 days!.
Otherwise I love this product, I am impressed with the display quality and the looks of this watch.
Again, I would suggest this watch to you if only 3 days battery back up is okay for you, and also wait for offers to buy it under 5k.
If anyone have any other questions they can ask. I'm gonna use this watch for a long period."
8944,4.0,"Pro:
-Looks premium in hand.
-Call/msg notification available
-Tracking activity, sleep time, steps are very near accurate.
-Battery backup superb.
-Amoled display awesome.

Con:
-Call receive option not available.
-Third party google map support is available. But, it could be available in official app itself.
-More watch face required. & Can save only 4 watch face on watch.

Overall value for money.

Edit:
-I have used Amazefit watch with moderate use (4days connected with my phone and other days i kept it in my table) and used it for 14days without charging. It was running on 28% on 14th day. This is amazing battery backup!
-My room mate ordered other brand HD display smartwatch for 2.5k. It's display & software looks like trash in front of this Amazefit watch. I felt happy for my choice.
-Thank you Amazefit."
8945,4.0,"Having used Mi bands before, I wanted to have something that resembles a watch and this has been a great buy. At first I was confused between getting a square dial or a circular dial but this one is perfect. I should add that this one looks small. But it looks amazing. If you have small hands, this is the perfect one and circular ones just look huge. If you have huge hands, this might look tiny.

Coming to the watch's performance, I have tried most of the basic things. SPO2, heart rate, Stress, PAI, sleep monitoring and it works nicely. You have to reply on whatever results you get, though I am sure it won't be 100% accurate but I found it similar to a Mi band or anything else. Anyway you should not be using this for medical purposes but otherwise its good. I used the GPS and the walking mode in the activity and found the results to be very nice and accurate and detailed. You get the overall review of your workout and I am sure it will be the same for other modes too. So to track your walking, running and all those things, it is perfect.

Connecting to the phone is a breeze and did not face any issues. Actually the watch is so good that you don't really have to use the phone app anytime, other than configuring all the setting like phone, app notifications. I have been using the watch without opening the app to check for anything for the past 3 days and I think that's a plus. The Music controls work very nicely. I usually listen to podcast on pocket cast and the forward button on the app is basically ""skip by 30 seconds"". So if I press the forward button on the watch, it skips by 30 seconds and it was perfect. Whatever app you are using on phone, it copes and pastes that functionality on the watch. Which is a good touch. You can also control the volume very easily on the watch.

I didn't face any issue with watch vibration during calls and app notif. The screen is BEAUTIFUL and its fun to navigate through anything and everything. I have put on WhatsApp notification but when I get a notification, if I press the watch, for some reason I am not taken to the messages I have to press the button and swipe up to see the message, which is not that big a problem. Or maybe I am doing something wrong. But its not an issue.

The number of watch faces is around 50, on the watch you can have only 4, but that is not a big deal at all. One analog and one digital on the watch is fine. And the ones available on the store are nice too. The always on display is amazing too. Sleek and minimal. You can customise it to analog, digital or set it to take shape of whatever watch face you have ON at that time. 10/10 for that. I have not checked the waterproof nature of it but seems okay for general use.

About the battery. Having it on the hand for full day, having the always on display on, all the modes all on, hear rate monitoring every 10 minutes and notifications on, 20% battery gets confused for every 24 hours. So 1% per hour would be the battery life. So it will last you for 100 hours on one charge. Which is around 4 days. And I think that is fine for a smartwatch for such a beautiful display with an always on display which displays all the information you need, tracks all the health related things and tracks your workout in too much detail. In current times of staying in mostly, charging it is no issue and hence I think battery life is good.

I am waiting for the update to arrive which will bring Alexa for the watch. Hoping it brings more improvements, though I am very happy with the purchase. Would recommend highly if you are looking for a nice looking small watch which serves as a normal watch and as a smart one. This one's perfect. Go for it."

cons
less watch faces
suddenly going to off mode

Over all, I am very happy. I give 4.5 out of 5"
8953,4.0,SPO2 reading do not work
8954,4.0,"This was my first smartwatch. I prefer the round dial because it looks more like a watch but options were limited especially in this price range. I got the (new version) of the GTS 2 mini. The watch seems pretty accurate with its tracking data like steps, sleep and calories. The user interface is also decent in both the watch and app. After 10 days of testing, here are my observations:
Battery life: It says 14 days, but it is false. To achieve that you will need to turn off all possible active tracking features and Bluetooth which is pointless. I would say 10-12 day battery is possible with always-on display OFF. With always-on display running only during daytime, I am able to get 6 days battery life which is amazing considering it is only a 220mah battery
Design: The watch looks quite nice on my small wrists and the subtle metal trimmings around adds a nice premium touch.
Comfort: No issues here. It is lightweight and doesn't cause any issues even while sleeping. Not sure why some found the strap bad. It may not be premium but it just works for me.
Tracking: Pretty accurate. SpO2 is a bit buggy. You have to wear the watch tightly and not move at all. Otherwise it doesn't measure. works 6/10 times. Steps and calories burnt is accurate as per the workout methods I tried. I am yet to test GPS accuracy. Sleep tracking is good as well.

Overall am happy with the purchase."
8955,4.0,"Recomended for Those who are looking for Amoled display and Gps in a smart watch. Crisp Amoled display, GPS and health tracking is fairly accurate (No watch can match medical grade equipment)
Only negetive I felt is no calling option.
Some other brands are offering BT calling in this price range. IP rating works perfectly fine."

8960,4.0,Value for money
8961,4.0,Product was super awesome just that Alexa couldn't work well. Above all my concern is i wanted the product to be replaced but couldn't get another one in exchange
8962,5.0,"Product:
Good watch for most activity , health tracking other added functionality. Light weight, feels like nothing which is good. Because heavy watches are uncomfortable to wear. Switched to nylon strap immediately and its more comfortable now. Battery of 7 days is good because more expensive watches (30k and above) we have to charge daily or alternate days. My purpose is to improve my habits and health as my job is quite demanding & stress full. So, i selected this watch that has everything (cost, fearures, build, comfort) well balanced.

Some attributes when selecting smart watch:
1. decide why you are buying & what you want to track. Core purpose must be met rather than some gimicks which you never use. Date & time, Health tracking & notifications from phone are only core purpose.
2. Check battery life of watch is longer you dont have to charge daily. Optimise watch setting (turn off things you dont use) to extend battery life.
3. You never install any apps on watch trust me so internal memory can be nominal.
4. Comfortable to wear. Pick right size. Little smaller watch with nylon strap (not silicon strap). If you have silicon strap replace it with decent quality nylon strap.
I saw some people reporting rashes on skin on wearing this watch. Because nylon straps are most easy to wear & most comfortable. Nylon strap are cheap, can be put while swimming, in rain, they are durable also. Spend 200 rupee and change strap to nylon strap.
5. Optimum priced,optimum features & slightly good build quality. Because electronics loose its value fast. So spend smart on smart electronics. Buying iphone and using it for 3-4 years is smart choice rather than buying 30+ k smart watch and not using daily. Buy over hyped 50+ smart watch dont use it and automatically your stress level will go high 😀. Trust me spend less. For 5k budget i dont mind buying new watch every year and still i will spend less and get latest improvements year on year rather than spending 30+ k one time that gets out dated in one year.
6. Remember smart watch is meant to improve our habits and health and for no other reason.

Smart watches are meant to remove stress and improve our life and not meant to cause stress and unwanted financial burden. Buy over hyped 50+ smart watch dont use it and automatically your stress level will go high 😀. Be smart."
8963,4.0,it is a worthy product.
8964,4.0,"I liked the watch working and health tracking, but the issue is the watch app was not so good , we don't know where the settings properly, it was confusing."
8965,4.0,"Pros
1. Display is just Amazing
2.Touch response is too Good
3. Build Quality is Up to the mark
Cons
1-Most of the times Heart rate monitoring system doesn't work, it's too bad and 24 hours heart rate monitoring is just useless.
2-When we measure spo2 it just tells ""wear the watch properly while measuring"" even if we wear it properly and tightly and gives no output either
3. Battery lasts only 3-4 days while always on display is on for 24 hours

So don't buy this watch if you are a fitness freak"
8966,4.0,The design is very elegant and the amoled display provide nice experience. Better to provide a feature to display the direction in always on display mode while using google map
8967,4.0,"After lot of research and reviews, i purchased this and I am completely satisfied with the watch.
Firstly it very light weight and you won't feel that you are wearing a watch.
Display quality is good.
Watch performance is good and activity tracking is also accurate.
You can definitely go for it."
8968,4.0,"Product is good but the gate up is a little under in comparison to other brands.

Please check all parameters before it reaches the customer.

8969,4.0,"For amazfit gts2 mini new version-

Review after 3 weeks of usage-
1. Battery backup- Average, 3 days battery backup on full usage i.e. heart rate, aod, stress monitoring etc enabled. 5 days backup with light usage.

2. Screen- great, AMOLED screen at this price range is a great advantage, gives a great look and touch is ok, no problems

3. Straps- the strap which comes with the watch is not of good quality, may become the reason for itching. To overcome this, prefer buying straps from third party. ANOTHER ADVANTAGE is changeable straps.

4. GPS- accurate, however takes some time to connect while starting any workout mode but it is accurate.

5. Steps tracking- 3 out of 5 in terms of accuracy, if the arm is not moving while walking or running or the hands are in the pocket or stationary, it will not count the steps which is one of the disadvantages of this watch. It counts 2000 as compared to manual counting of 4000 steps even while moving the arm.

6. Heart rate, spo2- heart rate is not that accurate as the fitness bands which are considered as best for these purposes. But not that much inaccurate. Spo2 is accurate.

7. Watch faces- amazfit claims that it has more than 100 watch faces in the watch store but the watch faces which have full details like heart rate, steps, date, time, calories burned etc are very few (around 15-20). However you can customize watch face but only the background, you can not customize which datails to be shown (it has only time and date, no steps, heart rate, calories are shown).

8. AOD- three types of eod are there, analogue, digital and same as watch face. First and third one works fine. But second one suddenly hangs and screen becomes black when watch is removed and again weared.

9. ALEXA- An added advantage at this price point but it only works when watch is connected to phone via bluetooth.

10. Delivery it took 11 days to get this product delivered which is unfortunate from a tech giant like amazon.

Rest all works fine, no problems faced till now.

In all, recommended, the problems are solvable through a software update other than battery which is a hardware problem."
8970,4.0,"I bought this product after seeing too many videos on YouTube.
First impressions is amoled screen, its really very impressive, display size is small but it look good enough in hand. The product i received didn't show spo2 measurement if i take 10 time reading i will show only 3-4 time most of the time it faileds
Sleeps tracking is accurate, other than heart rate is worst. If you are looking for fitness purpose it not good enough as per my experience. If you are buying only for look purpose then go ahead.
Youtuber are making hype please invest your money on good product don't waste it👍"
8971,4.0,"I have purchased this watch on sale for 4500 at that price this is the best
Pros: •DISPLAY IS AWESOME SMOOTH
•TOUCH RESPONSE IS GOOD
•GPS IS WORKING VERY WELL
• Sp2o sensor is working very well

CONS: •It has ghost steps it traks even if you move your hand just no walking solves this problem you have to open GPS walking

•Heart monitor is a bit inaccurate no that bad but you can get an idea for sure

•stress monitor is also a bit inaccurate.

Conclusion:- Buy only if you are getting this for under 5K a totally value for money watch for fitness other brands just doings looks and that this brand gives you best sensors and display.
Thanks"
8972,4.0,"Feels good to use, i got it after 15 days of order due to fake watch Deleivery in first attempt.

8973,4.0,"Pros:
1. Value for money
2. Touch is smooth
3. Quality
4. Activity tracking
5. Light weight
6. Notifications

Cons:
1. Battery life (hardly getting 3-4 days when Bluetooth enabled)
2. Screen is prone to scratches"
8974,4.0,"Purchased this product instead of other low cost alternatives with a lot of hope and expectation considering the so called brand name and so many positive video reviews. Found the display, customisable ui, battery life and features to be pretty good.

But to my utter disppointment, found step counting to be highly inaccurate in non-workout mode. The watch is counting steps even with slight movement of hands and even when sitting/driving. As far as sleep tracking is concerned, many naps were skipped altogether. Also, bluetooth gets disconnected even around 20 feet and there are only 2 watch faces you can keep apart from the 2 default ones. But other health data are detailed and app interface is also nice.

You can go for it only if daily steps count accuracy and sleep data accuracy don't bother you much but amoled display, aod, gps & smooth ui is what you want in a budget friendly watch. Otherwise, you can go for other cheaper alternatives."
8975,4.0,It's a good smartwatch with features that work quite accurately whether it is sleep monitoring or heart rate tracking.
8976,4.0,"Best in segment but one leck is SpO2 monitoring is weak. And some how battery back up is probably 2.5 Day.
Otherwise it is cool and Very Good watch."
8977,4.0,It seems sleep tracking is not that perfect.... Rest is good..!
8978,4.0,"Pros:
1. Great touch.
2. Screen display quality is awesome.
3. Beautiful interface.
4. Sensors are accurate.
5. Battery life is great if you are not actively monitoring your activities all the time.

Cons:
1. The rubber band might get smelly over time unlike other watches, so make sure to keep it clean.
2. Might look smaller on your hand it you have huge wrist. (I don't care)"
8979,4.0,Everything about watch is good no issues light weight good for girls also no issues in any of features given
8980,4.0,The watch is very accurate and the results are nearly close to the apple watch everything is good but why 4 stars are there some delays in the sync process in-app.
8981,4.0,"Pros

Heart rate - Accurate
GPS - Works fine in open space
Foot step tracker - Accurate
Walking Speed - Accurate with graph
Battery - Good for light use

Cons

Strap Quality - Low
Permission - Almost request all permission to connect with app in mobile
Brand - Huami, Parent XIAOMI, they are popular to provide best tech in low cost but concerns with privacy.

Make sure to remove permission not in use/not required."
8982,4.0,"REVIEW OF AMAZFIT GTS 2 Mini Smart watch (2021 model)

Hello everyone . Since the new model of amazfit GTS2 mini arrived , i am going to review the old model of it

Pros:

Display : 1.55 inch amoled display , really good look . ( pros)

Battery : coming with 220 maH , from 100 percent to 13 percent it takes 10 days to drain and it was expected to last 1 day longer ( normal use ) . But If you are a light user ,it can last it for 14 days . (Pro)

IP rating :IP 68 water resistant which is cool .(Pro)

Heartbeat sensor : It has heartbeat sensor and it is real , but it may not show real accuracy at all the time . But it performs good (pro)

Comfortness : It is really comfortable wearing this watch and the band is silicone material. (pro)

Work out modes : There are nearly 70+ workout modes and i tested out some , since it is built in GPS , it works nearly accurate but the measure is not that much accurate but it works well. (pro)

can track stress

Has PAI feature to progress your workout with better experience

Alexa assistant ( but need phone connection to activate this )

Has other modes like breathing ,menstrual cycle tracking,to-do-list , inbuilt alarm ,pomodoro timer ,sleep tracker ,Timer , In built compass , camera remote ,find the phone , controlling music etc.

Notification system : you can get notifications .

Call control system : You can accept or reject calls , but you cannot able to talk through watch.

Cons:

Build quality :it is told that this watch is completly aluminium frame but it is quite disappointing that only half frame is gun metal aluminium . and half is poly carbonate (con) .

Watch faces : the inbuilt watch faces are quite depressing at initial impressions but there are some watch faces that are really good . (con)

SPO2 : I don't know how much accurate it is , but coming to technical part , the sensors are failing most of the times . Sometimes cannot able to sync workout history .(con)

Verdict :

It is not a bad idea to spend money for this watch due to immense features and real sensors but you should compromise on sensors efficiency and build quality ."
8983,4.0,"Original 3rd Jan 2021: This is my first smartwatch. I have bought a couple of Honor fitness bands earlier for family, but this is my personal first. I have been keenly following the smartwatch space for the last 10 months or so and I'm aware of most of the products in the budget range. While I can afford a slightly more expensive one (GTS2/GTR2 or Honor GT2 Pro, Oppo Watch, Fitbit etc) with calling feature, I wanted to get the feel of a smartwatch in the budget range first. I gave a lot of thought and finally bought this one as it included GPS and Amazon Alexa (yet to be included, but must be available through an OTA update). I'd have loved to buy Amazfit Bip U Pro as it has almost the same features with an LCD display (has GPS and Alexa in the global version named Amazfit Pop Pro). It still isn't released in India.
Coming to the watch's performance, the typical features I tried today (first day) are Heart RATE (HR), SPO2, Stress monitoring and GPS. I have a pulse oximeter from Dr. Trust at home and so I could compare the HR and SPO2. The numbers on the watch aren't very accurate to my surprise (heart rate variation by 5-10 bpm and SPO2 percentage off by 10% points at times) . But I still feel it's more to do with calibration and the way these numbers are measured than inaccuracy of the hardware etc. GPS was a breeze as I walked on the terrace of my rural town house. It won't surprise me if I don't get the same performance in a metro city with a lot of high rise apartments etc. The compass worked fine when I compared it with my phone. Music controls worked fine, bluetooth data transfer or sync was good. I couldn't control the phone camera as I couldn't get that feature to work (refer to image and help me if you can). I didn't face any issue with watch vibration during calls and app notifications. The readability on the watch screen has been really good. Tried a couple of workouts. While the step count seems to be fine, not sure of the accuracy of the stats on other workout modes.
To conclude, I wouldn't say that this watch is a disappointment, but it needs improvements on the accuracy of the fitness stats. Probably I should give it more time, but fitness brands have done better in terms of accuracy (at least the Honor bands I've seen). Eagerly waiting for Alexa update as I'm curious what all it can do.
I would love to update my review after using the watch for few more days. Let's see.
Update (8th Jan 2021): The battery is a clear disappointment as many other users pointed out. I'm hardly getting it for 3.5 days with always on display and an occasional workout. Limited watch faces, both on device (4) and the app (57). Not many out of these 57 do justice to the good display. Waterproof nature of the device is good. I didn't dip it in water, but it got wet when I was bathing my kids and it seems to have a waterproof coating which was in action. I got the camera shutter to work. I hope Amazfit provides updates to fix battery drain and enable Alexa. Notifications didn't have an issue, but could not clear individual items (clear all worked)"
8984,4.0,"Reviewing after one month of using
Something that not mentioned

Sensors - BioTracker 2 PPG sensor, movement acceleration sensor, geomagnetic sensor,gyroscope sensor,ambient light sensor and SpO2 sensor.

Pros
1.Display and design (sleek and slim) and good to see
2. Accuracy is fantastic strongly recommend if you are looking for fitness.
3. Sensors
4. Alexa,it's really a fun and useful thing to use, remember this device only has mic NO SPEAKER . so Alexa response only in text format.
5. Most of the controls are done in watch itself

Cons
1. Battery life is average, if you turn oned everything ,it will be last for 2-3 days. Not more than that

2. Software is okish but need a little bit improvement but it's ok

3. Build quality is average beacusue it easyly get scratch

4. This watch DOES NOT HAVE SPEAKERS so if you are looking for bluetooth calling. You can't do this in this watch,
But how many of them use watches for calling. Think once if you need blutooth calling.
5. Highly Recommended to apply a good tempered glass

I will attach few proof of pros and cons please check it.
In accuracy I have compared with actual medical devices.
For further information about this product check in official website. Beacusue in amazon few things were not mentioned.

Conclusion: It's a good for one who looking for fitness
But it's not ok for one who looking for more features in it.
Like bluetooth calling,games, speakers etc.

8985,4.0," 1).Built quality is good feels premium , 2).Display is also good in sense colour pounchy,
3). sensors are pretty accurate
4). I Think alex is not that usefull in this watch,
5).battery backup is not that great as mentioned 14days battery life it give max to max 4-5 days if you are moderated user of like sports mode ,sleep tracking,heart rate and all
6) zepp app can be improved
7) overall nice product in terms of looking,feels premium ness , accuracy in sensors,display"
8986,4.0,"I think at this price, they should have provided calling facility. Also the size is quite small."
8987,4.0,"the watch itself looks pretty good. looks like an apple watch series type.
the step tracking is pretty good. however, it catches simple movements of hands and adds it as a step. it counted 12 steps when i was sitting. Touch feedbad is sometimes slow but works most of the time. Alexa doesn't listen properly [you have to go to the alexa screen for any command it wont listen to you if you're on any other screen or if the watch is close] by the time u swipe to the alexa screen, its better to do that task yourself so i found that pretty useless. obviously as it comes, spo2 is also inaccurate and stress levels are quite accurate. [don't expect spo2 to be right even in 10k watches]
Sleep tracking is pretty good. and it has tons of excercise options you can choose from.
Fitness -
it has tones of exercise options, it calculate the amount of calories your burn, your heart rate, kilometers you ran/walked for. you can set a goal in the watch and work out accordingly. It also calculates the calories you consume. 10/10 for the fitness part of the watch
Comfort-
it's surprisingly super lightweight. for the amount of features it has its very very light. however, the strap looks kinda cheap and it leaves red marks on the wrist and is quite itchy. [shown in the pic]
Overall-
for those looking for a watch under 6k, this is your best choice. for the strap itching maybe you can change it. its pretty good all around for the price."
8988,4.0,Good watch but Bluetooth call missing in this price range and company should provide screen protector with it or make scratch proof screen .. that's it
8989,4.0,"Snoozing the reminder not work properly, it's show all the reminder at 1 time not as we schedule."
8990,4.0,"This has been working as my regular watch that provides me data regarding my sleep and activity at the end of the day. Also helps in setting up alarm, creating shopping etc. with the use of Alexa. This does not measure activity automatically. You need to add the workout choice for it to keep a record."
8991,4.0,"These are some pros and cons according to me and then I'll share my opinion.
Pros :-
1. The Display is literally amazing.
2. It looks premium.
3. Stress, Sleep monitoring, SpO2, Heart rate wrorks well (still not recommended in medical emergency, it's not accurate but close to it)
4. For females, Period cycle tracking is a useful option.
5. The work out options that this watch provides it enough.
6. It supports alexa, with which you can command your alexa supported devices like Tv, lights and more.. Also it shows weather reports.
7. The touch response is smooth.
8. It can control music options like play, pause, next, go back. Connects well with ear buds.
9. The display size is small but it looks very good on my wrist.
10. It is completely water proof.

Cons :-
1. The price of the watch seems high according to the watch. (If you get this watch under 5k then it's worth spending the money)
2. Battery. The battery lasts only 3-4 days even if you turn off AOD and not use the watch that much. (I would say the battery could have been better as we are spending 6k which is not a low price at all for a middle class.)
3. There is no calling option ( you can only get to know who's calling and can cut the call, According to me the calling option is not that important I mean it's super weird talking on a watch.)
4. If you're looking for a bigger display then you should avoid this product. (Like I said the display is amazing and looks good in my perspective, but it's not a big display)

My opinion :-
So the main problem for me is the Battery, It only gives me 3 days back up which is not satisfying me, I even don't use AOD but it's still 3 days!.
Otherwise I love this product, I am impressed with the display quality and the looks of this watch.
Again, I would suggest this watch to you if only 3 days battery back up is okay for you, and also wait for offers to buy it under 5k.
If anyone have any other questions they can ask. I'm gonna use this watch for a long period."
8992,4.0,"Pro:
-Looks premium in hand.
-Call/msg notification available
-Tracking activity, sleep time, steps are very near accurate.
-Battery backup superb.
-Amoled display awesome.

Con:
-Call receive option not available.
-Third party google map support is available. But, it could be available in official app itself.
-More watch face required. & Can save only 4 watch face on watch.

Overall value for money.

Edit:
-I have used Amazefit watch with moderate use (4days connected with my phone and other days i kept it in my table) and used it for 14days without charging. It was running on 28% on 14th day. This is amazing battery backup!
-My room mate ordered other brand HD display smartwatch for 2.5k. It's display & software looks like trash in front of this Amazefit watch. I felt happy for my choice.
-Thank you Amazefit."
8993,4.0,"Having used Mi bands before, I wanted to have something that resembles a watch and this has been a great buy. At first I was confused between getting a square dial or a circular dial but this one is perfect. I should add that this one looks small. But it looks amazing. If you have small hands, this is the perfect one and circular ones just look huge. If you have huge hands, this might look tiny.

Coming to the watch's performance, I have tried most of the basic things. SPO2, heart rate, Stress, PAI, sleep monitoring and it works nicely. You have to reply on whatever results you get, though I am sure it won't be 100% accurate but I found it similar to a Mi band or anything else. Anyway you should not be using this for medical purposes but otherwise its good. I used the GPS and the walking mode in the activity and found the results to be very nice and accurate and detailed. You get the overall review of your workout and I am sure it will be the same for other modes too. So to track your walking, running and all those things, it is perfect.

Connecting to the phone is a breeze and did not face any issues. Actually the watch is so good that you don't really have to use the phone app anytime, other than configuring all the setting like phone, app notifications. I have been using the watch without opening the app to check for anything for the past 3 days and I think that's a plus. The Music controls work very nicely. I usually listen to podcast on pocket cast and the forward button on the app is basically ""skip by 30 seconds"". So if I press the forward button on the watch, it skips by 30 seconds and it was perfect. Whatever app you are using on phone, it copes and pastes that functionality on the watch. Which is a good touch. You can also control the volume very easily on the watch.

I didn't face any issue with watch vibration during calls and app notif. The screen is BEAUTIFUL and its fun to navigate through anything and everything. I have put on WhatsApp notification but when I get a notification, if I press the watch, for some reason I am not taken to the messages I have to press the button and swipe up to see the message, which is not that big a problem. Or maybe I am doing something wrong. But its not an issue.

The number of watch faces is around 50, on the watch you can have only 4, but that is not a big deal at all. One analog and one digital on the watch is fine. And the ones available on the store are nice too. The always on display is amazing too. Sleek and minimal. You can customise it to analog, digital or set it to take shape of whatever watch face you have ON at that time. 10/10 for that. I have not checked the waterproof nature of it but seems okay for general use.

About the battery. Having it on the hand for full day, having the always on display on, all the modes all on, hear rate monitoring every 10 minutes and notifications on, 20% battery gets confused for every 24 hours. So 1% per hour would be the battery life. So it will last you for 100 hours on one charge. Which is around 4 days. And I think that is fine for a smartwatch for such a beautiful display with an always on display which displays all the information you need, tracks all the health related things and tracks your workout in too much detail. In current times of staying in mostly, charging it is no issue and hence I think battery life is good.

I am waiting for the update to arrive which will bring Alexa for the watch. Hoping it brings more improvements, though I am very happy with the purchase. Would recommend highly if you are looking for a nice looking small watch which serves as a normal watch and as a smart one. This one's perfect. Go for it."

best suited for GPS tracking( i am using for outdoor cycling and i chose this watch for GPS tracking)
cons
less watch faces
suddenly going to off mode

Over all, I am very happy. I give 4.5 out of 5"
9001,4.0,SPO2 reading do not work
9002,4.0,"This was my first smartwatch. I prefer the round dial because it looks more like a watch but options were limited especially in this price range. I got the (new version) of the GTS 2 mini. The watch seems pretty accurate with its tracking data like steps, sleep and calories. The user interface is also decent in both the watch and app. After 10 days of testing, here are my observations:
Battery life: It says 14 days, but it is false. To achieve that you will need to turn off all possible active tracking features and Bluetooth which is pointless. I would say 10-12 day battery is possible with always-on display OFF. With always-on display running only during daytime, I am able to get 6 days battery life which is amazing considering it is only a 220mah battery
Design: The watch looks quite nice on my small wrists and the subtle metal trimmings around adds a nice premium touch.
Comfort: No issues here. It is lightweight and doesn't cause any issues even while sleeping. Not sure why some found the strap bad. It may not be premium but it just works for me.
Tracking: Pretty accurate. SpO2 is a bit buggy. You have to wear the watch tightly and not move at all. Otherwise it doesn't measure. works 6/10 times. Steps and calories burnt is accurate as per the workout methods I tried. I am yet to test GPS accuracy. Sleep tracking is good as well.

Overall am happy with the purchase."
9003,4.0,"Recomended for Those who are looking for Amoled display and Gps in a smart watch. Crisp Amoled display, GPS and health tracking is fairly accurate (No watch can match medical grade equipment)
Only negetive I felt is no calling option.
Some other brands are offering BT calling in this price range. IP rating works perfectly fine."

9009,4.0,Product was super awesome just that Alexa couldn't work well. Above all my concern is i wanted the product to be replaced but couldn't get another one in exchange
9010,4.0,"Product:
Good watch for most activity , health tracking other added functionality. Light weight, feels like nothing which is good. Because heavy watches are uncomfortable to wear. Switched to nylon strap immediately and its more comfortable now. Battery of 7 days is good because more expensive watches (30k and above) we have to charge daily or alternate days. My purpose is to improve my habits and health as my job is quite demanding & stress full. So, i selected this watch that has everything (cost, fearures, build, comfort) well balanced.

Some attributes when selecting smart watch:
1. decide why you are buying & what you want to track. Core purpose must be met rather than some gimicks which you never use. Date & time, Health tracking & notifications from phone are only core purpose.
2. Check battery life of watch is longer you dont have to charge daily. Optimise watch setting (turn off things you dont use) to extend battery life.
3. You never install any apps on watch trust me so internal memory can be nominal.
4. Comfortable to wear. Pick right size. Little smaller watch with nylon strap (not silicon strap). If you have silicon strap replace it with decent quality nylon strap.
I saw some people reporting rashes on skin on wearing this watch. Because nylon straps are most easy to wear & most comfortable. Nylon strap are cheap, can be put while swimming, in rain, they are durable also. Spend 200 rupee and change strap to nylon strap.
5. Optimum priced,optimum features & slightly good build quality. Because electronics loose its value fast. So spend smart on smart electronics. Buying iphone and using it for 3-4 years is smart choice rather than buying 30+ k smart watch and not using daily. Buy over hyped 50+ smart watch dont use it and automatically your stress level will go high 😀. Trust me spend less. For 5k budget i dont mind buying new watch every year and still i will spend less and get latest improvements year on year rather than spending 30+ k one time that gets out dated in one year.
6. Remember smart watch is meant to improve our habits and health and for no other reason.

Smart watches are meant to remove stress and improve our life and not meant to cause stress and unwanted financial burden. Buy over hyped 50+ smart watch dont use it and automatically your stress level will go high 😀. Be smart."
9011,4.0,it is a worthy product.
9012,5.0,"I liked the watch working and health tracking, but the issue is the watch app was not so good , we don't know where the settings properly, it was confusing."
9013,4.0,"Pros
1. Display is just Amazing
2.Touch response is too Good
3. Build Quality is Up to the mark
Cons
1-Most of the times Heart rate monitoring system doesn't work, it's too bad and 24 hours heart rate monitoring is just useless.
2-When we measure spo2 it just tells ""wear the watch properly while measuring"" even if we wear it properly and tightly and gives no output either
3. Battery lasts only 3-4 days while always on display is on for 24 hours

So don't buy this watch if you are a fitness freak"
9014,4.0,The design is very elegant and the amoled display provide nice experience. Better to provide a feature to display the direction in always on display mode while using google map

2. Screen- great, AMOLED screen at this price range is a great advantage, gives a great look and touch is ok, no problems

3. Straps- the strap which comes with the watch is not of good quality, may become the reason for itching. To overcome this, prefer buying straps from third party. ANOTHER ADVANTAGE is changeable straps.

4. GPS- accurate, however takes some time to connect while starting any workout mode but it is accurate.

5. Steps tracking- 3 out of 5 in terms of accuracy, if the arm is not moving while walking or running or the hands are in the pocket or stationary, it will not count the steps which is one of the disadvantages of this watch. It counts 2000 as compared to manual counting of 4000 steps even while moving the arm.

6. Heart rate, spo2- heart rate is not that accurate as the fitness bands which are considered as best for these purposes. But not that much inaccurate. Spo2 is accurate.

7. Watch faces- amazfit claims that it has more than 100 watch faces in the watch store but the watch faces which have full details like heart rate, steps, date, time, calories burned etc are very few (around 15-20). However you can customize watch face but only the background, you can not customize which datails to be shown (it has only time and date, no steps, heart rate, calories are shown).

8. AOD- three types of eod are there, analogue, digital and same as watch face. First and third one works fine. But second one suddenly hangs and screen becomes black when watch is removed and again weared.

9. ALEXA- An added advantage at this price point but it only works when watch is connected to phone via bluetooth.

10. Delivery it took 11 days to get this product delivered which is unfortunate from a tech giant like amazon.

Rest all works fine, no problems faced till now.

In all, recommended, the problems are solvable through a software update other than battery which is a hardware problem."
9018,4.0,"I bought this product after seeing too many videos on YouTube.
First impressions is amoled screen, its really very impressive, display size is small but it look good enough in hand. The product i received didn't show spo2 measurement if i take 10 time reading i will show only 3-4 time most of the time it faileds
Sleeps tracking is accurate, other than heart rate is worst. If you are looking for fitness purpose it not good enough as per my experience. If you are buying only for look purpose then go ahead.
Youtuber are making hype please invest your money on good product don't waste it👍"
9019,4.0,"I have purchased this watch on sale for 4500 at that price this is the best
Pros: •DISPLAY IS AWESOME SMOOTH
•TOUCH RESPONSE IS GOOD
•GPS IS WORKING VERY WELL
• Sp2o sensor is working very well

CONS: •It has ghost steps it traks even if you move your hand just no walking solves this problem you have to open GPS walking

•Heart monitor is a bit inaccurate no that bad but you can get an idea for sure

•stress monitor is also a bit inaccurate.

Conclusion:- Buy only if you are getting this for under 5K a totally value for money watch for fitness other brands just doings looks and that this brand gives you best sensors and display.
Thanks"
9020,4.0,"Feels good to use, i got it after 15 days of order due to fake watch Deleivery in first attempt.
Overal experience would be better if amazon improves its delivery."
9021,4.0,"Pros:
1. Value for money
2. Touch is smooth
3. Quality
4. Activity tracking
5. Light weight
6. Notifications

Cons:
1. Battery life (hardly getting 3-4 days when Bluetooth enabled)
2. Screen is prone to scratches"
9022,4.0,"Purchased this product instead of other low cost alternatives with a lot of hope and expectation considering the so called brand name and so many positive video reviews. Found the display, customisable ui, battery life and features to be pretty good.

But to my utter disppointment, found step counting to be highly inaccurate in non-workout mode. The watch is counting steps even with slight movement of hands and even when sitting/driving. As far as sleep tracking is concerned, many naps were skipped altogether. Also, bluetooth gets disconnected even around 20 feet and there are only 2 watch faces you can keep apart from the 2 default ones. But other health data are detailed and app interface is also nice.

You can go for it only if daily steps count accuracy and sleep data accuracy don't bother you much but amoled display, aod, gps & smooth ui is what you want in a budget friendly watch. Otherwise, you can go for other cheaper alternatives."
9023,4.0,It's a good smartwatch with features that work quite accurately whether it is sleep monitoring or heart rate tracking.
9024,4.0,"Best in segment but one leck is SpO2 monitoring is weak. And some how battery back up is probably 2.5 Day.
Otherwise it is cool and Very Good watch."
9025,4.0,It seems sleep tracking is not that perfect.... Rest is good..!
9026,4.0,"Pros:
1. Great touch.
2. Screen display quality is awesome.
3. Beautiful interface.
4. Sensors are accurate.
5. Battery life is great if you are not actively monitoring your activities all the time.

Cons:
1. The rubber band might get smelly over time unlike other watches, so make sure to keep it clean.
2. Might look smaller on your hand it you have huge wrist. (I don't care)"
9027,4.0,Everything about watch is good no issues light weight good for girls also no issues in any of features given
9028,4.0,The watch is very accurate and the results are nearly close to the apple watch everything is good but why 4 stars are there some delays in the sync process in-app.
9029,4.0,"Pros

Heart rate - Accurate
GPS - Works fine in open space
Foot step tracker - Accurate

3. Bluetooth calling is significant, both speaker & Mic work well.
4. Battery performance is satisfactory
Cons:
1. Watch built / body is bit lighter as I compare to another watch with me i.e. Fireboltt Hulk so it can be improved.

9071,4.0,Speaker quality is ok ok type .... otherwise a good watch
9072,4.0,Great product!
9073,4.0,"What i Like About This Watch....

1. Display

No Doubt it has Best In Class Amoled Display.. You Will face no Problems in Bright Sunlight. Its Bright and crisp. It has 5 levels. I Mostly use Level 1 in Indoor. For Outside you can see it in Level 3, 4.

2. UI/Interface.

It has a very Systematic and Simplified Interface. Every Folders has a Sub Items. Thats make this watch more easy to use.

3. Vibration Motor.

The Vibration Motor is Good in this watch. It can alert you easily.

4. Notification.

You can See All the basic notification such as call, sms, whataapp, insta, fb etc. Call Rejection, Silence and Quick Reply Option works great.

5. Sensors

Only Heart Rate and SPO2 Sensors Works Well.

6. Battery

If you use the watch normally like, Brightness level at 1 or 2, Raise to wake up Option for 5 sec and Dont use Always on Display. Activity Mode for around 2 hrs in a day. The watch can last for 6 days easily.

It also has a Fast Charging. I think around one & half hr.

7. Extra Features

It has some cool features Such as Stock Data, Calculator, Alarm & Reminder, Weather Forecast.

What I don't Like About the watch..

1. Step Counter Sensor

The Step Counter is Inaccurate even after the software Updates. It stuck and the final results are not correct. I thought it was only in my watch so i placed a replacement order. Even after that also the new watch has the same issue.
Hardware is Good but Software is need to be updated again.

2. It does not has a Mic & Speaker

You can not use Voice Command directly from watch. You need a TWS if you want a voice assistant or to answer the call.

At this price point Noise should have also add watch calling/dialpad features.

3. App

Sometimes the App lags while sync with Sports Record.

5. Sleep Mode

The sleep mode only works at Night. It dont work in day time. Sometimes its accurate and somtime its not.

6. Calory Meter

When you open Sports Mode for example i am doing Cycling. The Calory data is not going to sync with the Main data of the Watch. Kindly Merge it so that we will get the correct Calory Information.

My Suggestion to Noise.

Try to fix the issues such as step counter, sleep monitor, calory data in workout mode in the next update.

Add Hindi Language Support.

Add gesture keyboard and enable manual reply.

If possible try to add a Navigation Feature that will sync with the Google Map and it will show the direction notification and other data in the watch. It will be good for Bike Riders.

Conclusion

So if you need a watch which has a good built quality, display and basic features then its a great watch."

So that hopeless set for me. I was very much interested to buy any good sport watch. Its useless without mobile and uts app. I suggest, see strava app which company watch is configured with strava, buy the same and dont try such new. There are other such toys available within ₹1k online.
After one month linings appearing in display. Complain raised but no action despite many mail and complaints. If company listen to customer than go for the watch."
9141,4.0," Super,🙃☺️"
9142,4.0,"Best watch 🙂
it's a really good budget friendly smartch watch featuring almost all the features of other expensive smart watches in the market.
Build quality of the watch is quiet good , the straps are really smooth , I did not feel any discomfort despite of wearing the continiously for more than a day and always during the night while sleeping.
It has lot of watch face options as well as we can customize our own watch face which is good.
All the sensors works quiet good , the spo2 and bom ratings are quiet accurate.
Sleep tracking also works really good and gives the accurate results.
I have been wearing it to the gym since a week and was impressed by the step count and calorie burnt ratings ,it gives you exact rating and is really helpful during the workouts.
I have worne it in rain couple of times and also in sweat and thanks for the ip68 waterproof which has not given any problem till now.
Message and call notifications are good ,it has only option to cut the call and no option to silence the call which I felt is missing however the call vibration or ringing in the watch can be silenced by the power button.
One bad thing I felt about the watch is the the camera control doesnot work sometimes, the camera given in the app opens a blank screen sometimes and takes time to load the actual camera .i have faced this problem once in a week of usage apart from this camera control is quiet good and the selfies can be captured by shaking the hand it's quiet cool.
This watch is best Watch."
9143,4.0,After one and a half month its power button started missing the clicks and after 2 - 3 days it's screen also started moving by its own...any noise or fireboltt watch is much better at this price range...I m only giving 2 stars because of its sensors sleep tracking is really accurate steps counter fluctuate by 10 - 30 steps only and heart rate monitoring is also quite accurate but the bp is highly inaccurate.
9144,5.0,It's good product but Touch Screen is not GoodMore progress is needed.

9146,4.0,Raise to wake the screen is not working for this smartwatch.
9147,3.0,TAGG VERVE MAX UNBOXING REVIEW
9148,4.0,"This watch comes with a fantastic screen resolution where you get a magnificent display size.
Another good thing about it is that it has very less bezels around the screen area which makes it look more premium.
Touch, Connectivity & Accuracy is overall good in every aspect of a smartwatch. Straps & charger is of good quality.
Just one thing is missing, you may find not so many options of setting in watch as it is just limited to basic settings.
Overall with the price tag of ₹2,999 it’s a deal breaker for smartwatches category."

So is this a product that had issues and was returned and again renewed and send to me?? Also if not so, then how the manufacturing date is nearly one year old being launched on may 2022???"
9151,4.0,Wrist wake up function is very slow sometimes it doesnt wake up.
9152,4.0,"Finally my search for smart watch ends here. After a lot of research and many returns, i bought this product and it never disappointed me. Without 2nd thought u can go for it if u r looking for BP monitor, GPS, Games, Sleek design and large display. I loved it and recommend to my friends."
9153,4.0,"It's all good, working fine. I am Using it for approx 20 days, This watch is best in this price range.
It actually measures soft surfaces too, but it's just an error, because I tested it many times with Oxy meter while wearing on wrist, it measures very accurate heart rate and Blood Oxygen.

I don't need Calling feature, That's just a market strategy, If I buy a calling smart watch still I will jot use that feature. Instead I will take my phone for call.
It can mute or decline call.
I would Suggest it buy it if you want to buy a smart watch under 2500.

If I get any issue, I will update my review.
Till now it's best in this price."

9157,4.0,"I would say its a best watch under middle men using .
Few key points:
- Heart Rate is accurate and working properly.
- Oxymeter sometimes accurate.
- Sleep tracking is very accurate.

9164,4.0,Overall the watch is very good. It has accurate sensors but the only problem is that we can't set alarm through watch. I hope that the company would bring this feature in next update.
9165,4.0,Company claims that battery last up to 7 days but real it is hardly 4 days
9166,4.0,"Display is bigger as compare to other watches and quality was good smooth working , excellent battery life at this price i loved it"
9167,4.0,"Good service ..
Needs to work on betterry"
9168,4.0,It's a stylish watch and looks premium on hand. I purchased many smart watches before but in this segment I find it most stylish . The build quality is awesome and the main thing is battery back up - awesome . Yes it does lasts more than any other watch I have . Sensors work perfectly . I use it to count my steps basically as a fitness tracker and I loved its performance . Sleep monitor is a good feature too. Music player is obviously the best part. In all the watch is user friendly and can be used by you and your parents too . Makes a great gift idea .
9169,4.0, I liked the display quality in bright sunlight also the battery backup.
9170,4.0,Touch is fabulous step counter is quite accurate 1 thing i need to mention is that the watch faces aren't that good other than that its a good smartwatch.
9171,4.0,There is no extra orist strap in the box that I saw in the unboxing video on youtube tag verb max.
9172,4.0,"Ok-ok watch with decent battery, health measurements, not so much comfortable because of hard stripes, no speaker’s"
9173,4.0,"First of all, the built quality of the watch is superb. Precision-cut design. Looks so cool and elegant. Feels like feather.

Excellent battery life. Accuracy of SpO2, Heart rate and sleep tracking are reliable.

Plenty of watch faces to choose from and has a custom-designable watch face.

Quick and easy connectivity with the mobile.

Good for rough and care-free use.

Absolute value for money.

In terms of service, it is excellent. Faced some issues with the product initially bought and got it replaced with a brand-new unit within the stipulated time.

Finally, in one line, a product worth buying"
9174,4.0,Nice product 👍🏻😊 touch screen is good
9175,4.0,"nice product and the battery backup is also awesome,it runs for approx 25 days in a single charge which is upto the mark of 10 days battery backup claimed by brand.It is very slim and size is amazingly compatible for wearing and has the half of weight than other brand smartwatches...the only disadvantage is that its screen got scratched easily so don't forget to apply screen guard on it....after all the product is awesome....and especially the packing is very very nice,its box is awesome and looks very premium....loved it...."
9176,4.0,Audio and sound calling is not available so please all connecting the watche voice. We are also connecting the watche send to him sir.
9177,4.0,"hello sagar here
I bought tagg verve max smartwatch. it was not good in this price range.but because big display I bought this smartwatch.
The tagg was investing more money for external packaging and less money for display quality at this price range.
some companies are did good work more than tagg.
I am not that much satisfied.
service provider has send good condition smartwatch thanks for that."
9178,4.0,"Good battery backup,worth"
9179,4.0,"All is good about this watch nice watch 🥰
But raise to wake up is a issue hopefully they can change in uptade but this is not big issue
Overall nice watch❤️"
9180,4.0,I really liked the product and i am writing the review after using it for 2 months and it's a. Nice watch
9181,4.0,"Comparatively better accuracy in terms of step count, calories burnt, kilometres etc."
9182,4.0,Good
9183,4.0,Want to exchange but nobody comes
9184,4.0,It would be better if 'found your mobile' and 'quick reply' options are there. Hope it can be added by firmware upgrade.
9185,4.0,Product color actually delivered and shown on amazon website is totally different. Many times wrong color products are delivered and also the resolution/colour shown in picture is set to attract people and resolution/color of actual product never matches with one shown on website. Its a false promotion we can say.
9186,4.0,"It is good watch, but some times it touch screen does not work. But now it is working very good. Nice 👍"
9187,4.0,"Pros:
Smooth touch, easy to pair, average watch faces, software is mature.

Cons:
Inaccurate sleep tracker, BP sensor is fake."
9188,4.0," I purchased as on 4th Jun 22 being newly launched @₹2799 now reduced after 2 month @1799 so disappointed. Look is good but not configured with strava is more disappointing. So that hopeless set for me. I was very much interested to buy any good sport watch. Its useless without mobile and uts app. I suggest, see strava app which company watch is configured with strava, buy the same and dont try such new. There are other such toys available within ₹1k online.
After one month linings appearing in display. Complain raised but no action despite many mail and complaints. If company listen to customer than go for the watch."
9189,4.0," Super,🙃☺️"
9190,4.0,"Best watch 🙂
it's a really good budget friendly smartch watch featuring almost all the features of other expensive smart watches in the market.
Build quality of the watch is quiet good , the straps are really smooth , I did not feel any discomfort despite of wearing the continiously for more than a day and always during the night while sleeping.
It has lot of watch face options as well as we can customize our own watch face which is good.
All the sensors works quiet good , the spo2 and bom ratings are quiet accurate.
Sleep tracking also works really good and gives the accurate results.
I have been wearing it to the gym since a week and was impressed by the step count and calorie burnt ratings ,it gives you exact rating and is really helpful during the workouts.
I have worne it in rain couple of times and also in sweat and thanks for the ip68 waterproof which has not given any problem till now.
Message and call notifications are good ,it has only option to cut the call and no option to silence the call which I felt is missing however the call vibration or ringing in the watch can be silenced by the power button.
One bad thing I felt about the watch is the the camera control doesnot work sometimes, the camera given in the app opens a blank screen sometimes and takes time to load the actual camera .i have faced this problem once in a week of usage apart from this camera control is quiet good and the selfies can be captured by shaking the hand it's quiet cool.
This watch is best Watch."
9191,4.0,After one and a half month its power button started missing the clicks and after 2 - 3 days it's screen also started moving by its own...any noise or fireboltt watch is much better at this price range...I m only giving 2 stars because of its sensors sleep tracking is really accurate steps counter fluctuate by 10 - 30 steps only and heart rate monitoring is also quite accurate but the bp is highly inaccurate.
9192,4.0,It's good product but Touch Screen is not GoodMore progress is needed.
9193,4.0,Good and useful
9194,4.0,Raise to wake the screen is not working for this smartwatch.
9195,4.0,TAGG VERVE MAX UNBOXING REVIEW
9196,4.0,"This watch comes with a fantastic screen resolution where you get a magnificent display size.
Another good thing about it is that it has very less bezels around the screen area which makes it look more premium.
Touch, Connectivity & Accuracy is overall good in every aspect of a smartwatch. Straps & charger is of good quality.
Just one thing is missing, you may find not so many options of setting in watch as it is just limited to basic settings.
Overall with the price tag of ₹2,999 it’s a deal breaker for smartwatches category."
9197,4.0,Bezeless hone se maza aata...kafi mote bezels hai...par thik thak hai..
9198,4.0,"The product description says it was first available may 2022. But today, 29th October 2022, i got the product that was manufactured on dec 2021. So is this a product that had issues and was returned and again renewed and send to me?? Also if not so, then how the manufacturing date is nearly one year old being launched on may 2022???"
9199,4.0,Wrist wake up function is very slow sometimes it doesnt wake up.
9200,4.0,"Finally my search for smart watch ends here. After a lot of research and many returns, i bought this product and it never disappointed me. Without 2nd thought u can go for it if u r looking for BP monitor, GPS, Games, Sleek design and large display. I loved it and recommend to my friends."
9201,4.0,"It's all good, working fine. I am Using it for approx 20 days, This watch is best in this price range.
It actually measures soft surfaces too, but it's just an error, because I tested it many times with Oxy meter while wearing on wrist, it measures very accurate heart rate and Blood Oxygen.

I don't need Calling feature, That's just a market strategy, If I buy a calling smart watch still I will jot use that feature. Instead I will take my phone for call.
It can mute or decline call.
I would Suggest it buy it if you want to buy a smart watch under 2500.

If I get any issue, I will update my review.
Till now it's best in this price."

9310,4.0," Used this watch for over a month now.. Bought it during the first sale.. Keep reading for an unbiased review and tips/tricks to ensure all the functions in the watch are working smoothly.
1) Large Curved Display in this price category - 1.69 inch
2) Battery with heavy usage and frequently waking up the screen, alexa, alarms, notifications is about 3 days. On standby while just checking the time occassionally is about 8 days. Pretty good. Full charging time is about 1.5 hours. Decent quality magnetic charging cable provided. Use your own low power adapter, power bank or laptop.
3) Has all the necessary health / workout tracking options.. Spo2( Oxymeter), Heart Rate monitor..Accuracy is 95-98%. Sleep tracking is pretty accurate too. Paedometer is accurate most of the times, but sometimes few hundred steps are added randomly without any activity. This happens randomly once in 3-4 days. Stress Monitor is also there but not sure how it's calculated. The sensors aren not fake most probably because if the watch isn't in contact with your skin it will display a warning message and won't display data.
4) Lift to wake up gesture works but with a 1 second delay.. which is manageable. It has Tap to wake functionality too.
5) Works with most popular notifications: Whatsapp, SMS, Facebook, Instagram etc. Can read the entire SMS on watch and most of the other messages unless it's very long.
6) Calls can't be picked up or silenced.. You can only see the caller id and reject the call.
7) BT Music Control, Weather ☁️ update and Alexa are other usable smart features.
8) 50 different watch face are available on the Boat wave app. Some are really good.. You can also have customised wallpapers as watch faces . See the posted pictures.
9) The Boat Wave app is neatly organized and syncs health data without any issues instantly. The app also has assisted GPS functionality which can track your running activities on a map, in case you need that data.

Straps can be easily replaced with fancy straps.
12 ) Works both with Android and iPhone flawlessly. Tested on both.

TIPs AND TRICKs ________________________________________

1) Boat wave app needs to run in the background all the time for your call notifications, message notifications, Alexa functionality and Weather updates. If you accidentally clear all the cache and background apps from the phone, the watch will disconnect from the phone after some time when idle ( no active inputs probably after 10-15 mins). Keep the boat wave app running in the background. Most people complaining that the watch frequently disconnected might unintentionally be clearing all the background apps. My watch was continuously connected for 4 straight days without me having to reconnect as long as the boat wave app was running in the background.

2) Alexa on this watch can do a lot of things..It can set your alarms, start the stopwatch, show weather, control Alexa based devices like Echo, wireless lights and AC, work as a simple calculator, translate simple/ short English sentences to German, Spanish, Italian, French and Portugese, get you common stock quotes from internet, can you snippets of general information from the internet in case you don't know something. Yes, Alexa on your watch getting you the information is a little slow, takes about 30 -40 seconds to process your request but it's convenient and better that taking out the phone from your pocket which might take similar amount of time or longer. In my personal experience, Alexa works a little faster on Android as compared to iphone ( maybe 2-3 second difference). Also if there is break while speaking or if there is a long sentence, then it's difficult for Alexa to understand.. Check my video.. Keep it short and you should get the results accurately
3) For Alexa to work properly: After connecting the Boat Wave app with an Amazon account, download the Alexa app and check your Xtend watch is visible under Devices option.
4) To pickup and make calls handsfree without using the phone, just use a Bluetooth headset with voice assistant function. It will work as a charm. The speaker function on most smart watches is useless as it's not convenient for calls while traveling or in a crowded place due to low volume and obviously you don't want everyone to hear your private conversation.. With voice assistant feature on your BT headset you can make a call or play music without having to touch your phone.

Few other functions which could have been provided and is missing. Actually available in many similarly priced devices :
1) Torch 🔦 - Makes the display bright white.. Comes handy in darkness.
2) Remote shutter button for camera.
3) Call silencing option could have been added."

Design, Build & Comfort
When buying a smartwatch, one always thinks about its design and look. Apart from features, design and build is another major aspect one should take care of when buying a smartwatch. The boat has worked on its design this time which brings it to a premium side in terms of look. The design is inspired by the Apple Watch 3, but it cannot be compared to that. Obviously, in every aspect, Apple Watch 3 would be much better than the Boat Xtend Smartwatch. Redmi Watch as well as Amazfit Bip U Pro has the same shape and design, but the build quality is much premium on this one.

Boat Xtend design and build
I personally don’t like the color scheme of this Boat Xtend Smartwatch. The black color variant comes with a golden color metallic frame. I believe the gold color would fade away after some time. There are three other color variants, which also don’t look stylish as this one. However, that is my personal opinion on the color scheme, so maybe you might find the color scheme to be good.

Boat Xtend design
The watch has 5ATM water resistance. It has silicon straps, which are quite comfortable. The straps are good quality straps which you will find comfortable with regular usage.

Display
Coming to the display, the watch has a 42mm square shape display. What you see on this one is a TFT panel. The screen has big bezels, however, the good part is that the screen goes completely back when it is off, so you won’t notice the bezels, and the screen quality won’t feel cheap at all. It doesn’t have an always-on display, but we cannot complain about that. The watch offers a screen on time of up to 20 seconds and up to 12 levels of brightness control.

Boat Xtend display quality
I find the display quality of the Boat Xtend Smartwatch to be better than the previous smartwatch from Boat. View angle is good on this one, and you can clearly see content on this smartwatch even in the sunlight. The color on this one is not very saturated, but this isn’t something that we can complain about in this price range.

Watch UI And Features
The UI of this smartwatch is clean and easy to use. There is a single button on the watch which works as the power/off button as well as the back button. Moreover, the display is a touchscreen display that works without any problem. There isn’t much animation on the bar menu, and the navigation is simple, so you won’t find it difficult to use. However, the watch may lag a bit. The company has done cost-cutting in terms of the processor, that’s why you may find it to lag a bit, but it is OK, and not a big deal at the price point you get it.

Boat Xtend Ui
The watch offers all the basic fitness features such as daily activity (which includes total steps walked, calories burnt, and time), heart rate, sleep tracking, stress tracking breath training, SpO2 training, meditation, find my phone, and music control. Apart from that, there are 14 different support modes on this watch. I tried a few of them, and they worked fine. The watch notifies you of the incoming calls, messages received, and various other notifications in detail.

Boat Xtend smartwatch review
Alexa Support
The main highlight of the Boat Xtend is the Amazon Alexa Support. The watch has an in-built microphone, and you can access it by long-pressing the back button. Do note that you can only do some basic tasks with Alexa on the watch like setting an alarm, setting a timer, and such. Well, it is a good thing to have Alexa on a watch, but you won’t find it very useful. Probably you will use it for a day or two out of excitement, and then you won’t prefer using it because it only does some basic tasks. So, even if Boat missed this feature, it won’t be a problem.

Boat Xtend Alexa support
Watch Faces
The next cool thing about this Boat Smartwatch is the watch faces you get on this one. You get more than 100 watch faces on the watch, and probably more watch faces will be added to it. Moreover, you can also set a custom watch face as well.

Boat Xtend watch faces
Boat Wave App
You will have to download the Boat Wave App to use the watch. The app is available for both Android as well as iOS devices. You won’t be seeing bugs on the app, and it works perfectly. I haven’t noticed any problem with connectivity like frequent disconnection. The interface of the Boat Wave is clean and simple. You will get all the fitness-related options and all the watch settings on the app itself.

Accuracy
Accuracy is one of the important aspects that one should take care of when buying a smartwatch. So talking about the accuracy, I tested everything on this watch, from normal walking to running, sleeping, and much more, and I find the results to be accurate.

Boat Xtend accuracy test
Compared to Realme or Redmi Watch, the result was the same on all of them. So, there is no problem with the accuracy. I don’t find the results to be accurate on most of the budget fitness trackers, but yes, this smartwatch is accurate in terms of fitness tracking, sleep tracking, and everything it does.

Boat Xtend accuracy
Comparing it to the Noise watch which we tried recently, the stress level as well as the SpO2 tracking is much more accurate on this one. It also has the option to track the menstrual cycle in women.

Boat Xtend accuracy
Battery
You get to see a 300mAH battery on this one, which the company claims to last 7 days. However, if you use most of the features of the watch, then the battery will last about two and a half days. If you keep the brightness low, then the battery will last about 3-4 days. I find the battery life to be a downside of the watch. It comes with magnet hook charging support.

Final Words
Boat Xtend Smartwatch is a decent smartwatch from the Boat. It offers all the basic fitness features you will find on a budget fitness tracker, a good display, Alexa support, good design and build, and much more. The smartwatch at this price is quite good. Personally, what I didn’t like about this smartwatch is its color scheme. However, if you like the color scheme, then I would recommend you to go for it. Overall the watch is good with nothing to dislike about it except for the battery life. The battery life on this one is quite low. The company claims it to have a battery life of 7 days, but with regular usage, it will last for 2-3 days. If you are looking for a good smartwatch under Rs.5000, and you can adjust with the battery life, and you like the color scheme, then I would recommend you to go for this smartwatch. It offers all the features that should be there in a smartwatch under Rs.5000."
9312,3.0,"Pros:

1. Premium build quality with matte finishing- sturdy polycarbonate frame, good soft silicone straps that r absolutely flush with the body of the watch. Attractive, trendy colours.
2. Heart Rate (except heart rate spikes in weight training), Pedometer(steps counter) are accurate but SPO2 is off by +/- 2% when compared to Pulse Oximeter readings. But most smart watches offer the same accuracy. Sleep tracking is accurate only for bed time & wake up time, duration but stages of sleep are inaccurate. Light, deep sleep, waking detected but no REM sleep detected. Sleep data from the watch synchronises smoothly with Boat Wave app. Issues warning msg if watch not worn on hand properly and does not detect data of surfaces.
3. Large (1.69""), clear bright, sharp LCD IPS display even in the sun.
4. Touch not smooth, experienced jitters. UI also lags at times & after attaching the tempered glass sometimes some functions require 02-03 taps to work. But acceptable scrolling response if finger moved diagonally instead of vertically.
5. In app GPS works superbly. Excellent route tracking on the map. This feature is not advertised in their description.
6. Bluetooth 5.0 connectivity is good if mobile is kept in close proximity(7m). The Boat Wave app must remain running in the background at all times.
7. Definitely splash proof though did'nt take the risk of submerging the watch.
8. All notifications are working, no problem with call alerts or SMS msgs or social media app notifications. No lags at all though there is provision for a 3 sec lag which can be turned on.
9. Alexa works superbly but since there is no speaker, info is displayed on the screen. My Wipro Smart Bulb, FireTV stick can be controlled easily using the inbuilt Alexa on the watch. Alexa can do mathematical calculations, currency conversions, even foreign language translations, apart from supplying info on anything under the sun. But ofcourse, Alexa cannot make calls. Alexa can set alarm, timer also.
10. Sedentary alert, drinking water reminder, stress alert, menstrual cycle alert, alarms, timers function well.
11. Boat Wave app connects easily & no lags observed. Data syncs smoothly with Google Fit app. Excellent health reports and motivational rewards system in the form of badges. But settings can be changed only through the app and the watch needs to be restarted for the new settings to be effective.
12. Training, Sports modes r good.
13. Guided Breathing mode is also good.
14. Find my phone works well.
15. Extremely stylish, light weight & comfortable for all day wear.
16. 07 watch faces available in the device with 04 preset which cannot be deleted. The rest can be changed from the Boat Wave app.

Cons:

1. Lacks vibration intensity control.
2. Lacks Camera control shutter. But can't figure out its use as my handset accepts both voice commands & gestures to click pics.
3. No quick reply messages for notifications/call alerts.
4. No call acceptance or silencing feature. A work around can be if bluetooth handset is connected at the same time.
5. SPO2 is not accurate and sometimes freezes at 97%. But this is common in all smart watches.
6. Battery does'nt last more than 03 days if continuous HR measurement is turned on. Otherwise easily lasts for 7 days.
7. Watch faces are very childish. Expected better quality designs. Company can easily improve on this in their next update.
8. Amazon Prime only replacement, no refund policy is not good. At least colour change should be allowed once.
9. Music control feature does not display the title of the song.
10. No BP monitoring or temperature monitoring feature. Smart watches usually do not provide reliable BP data.
11. No calling feature. But it does'nt matter as most don't want conversations to be public.
12. A bit large for narrow wrists, band @22 mm is a bit wide.
13. Company should provide a tempered glass protector. No mention of protective glass on the display mentioned. Have attached a Scot tempered glass purchased separately.
14. There are actually only 10 sports modes. Boat has bloated the list with Indoor-Outdoor combi of 4 sports (Walking, Running, Swimming, Cycling).
15. There is no light sensor. Auto brightness is only time dependant but works well.

Was a wedding anniversary gift for my wife who liked it very much even the colour- the evergreen, classic gold-black. Overall the best smart watch with Alexa built in, available at the budget price point of under Rs 3000. An excellent Fitness Tracker but average Health Monitor."
9313,4.0,"First I want to tell.
1.The watch want to update first either it will not work, so it reqest to seller to check the product before selling.

2. The product is very good and satisfied according to price.

3. I will suggest to purchase it. Coz all is better.

4. But seller should check the product before selling to customers.

5. Coz I had return it first then after I recived it, it better coz the device is not updated.

Thank you"

9321,4.0,"While it seems very appealing but pl mind that functions are very limited and practically you can't use many. Also there's no voice calling or Alexa voice support though you can give give voice command. Limited use, not very great product i will say."

9324,5.0,"I've been using this for 45 days or so and overall it's very good purchase for me..The sleep tracker is accurate, the heart rate is accurate,stress level monitor works well, the oxygen level travels around 96 to 98 in my case and I'm not quite sure whether it's accurate or not..Keeping this aside there are several things..You are provided with 150+ watch faces however you can install 2 watch faces from the app at a time in the watch and 1 customised watch face in which you can add your own picture..The touch screen lags a lot..Weather is only updated when the phone is near you and is connected with bluetooth and location..Same with alexa and music controls..If you keep brightness at level 1 then the battery lasts upto 15 days..Glass will easily get scratches which will ruin it's look...It has flashlight(torch) which helps a lot..If you are away from your phone then only time, heartrate, stress level, spo2 level, alarm, timer, sports mode and steps,calories,distance travelled works..Alexa obviously along with weather, music controls do not work without your phone near you that is connected to internet bluetooth and location...Overall it's a good purchase at this price point."

9347,5.0,"Alexa is not works in it, This is bad whats the importance of giving it."
9348,4.0,"I have received this product a couple of days ago and now I am going to give an honest review of it.

This product is a great item if you are looking for a budget smartwatch. For its price, it provides quite accurate measurements of your BPM, stress, SPO2 etc. I have verified it's measurements with an actual oximeter and it proved to be accurate. However, the pedometer of the watch randomly adds around 100 steps. The pedometer is accurate otherwise.

The touch display of the 1.69"" watch impressed me. The watch has a sharp display, and smooth touch, which makes you feel like you are on a smartphone. The response time is quite well too. However, the animations lag which is not very eye pleasing, but workable.

The battery is great. The watch would be powered on for one whole night and would not lose a single percent of battery. Even while using, it loses a reasonable amount of power. For first time users, who just received their product: You might notice the battery is draining extremely quick. Do not panic. It is recommended to charge the battery for at least 2 hours before first use. It stabilizes the battery. The next time you use your watch, it would work as normal.

The built-in Alexa is perhaps my favorite feature of this watch. It's response time is around 5 seconds, and is quite fun to use a virtual assistant on the go. It can tell you facts, jokes, weather, calculations, translations and loads of other stuff, which might be useful for quickly looking up something. However, Alexa does not have a speaker. It gives a text output. The text output can sometimes end with ""..."" (ellipses) which mean the output is too long to print. It can also fail to provide relevant output at times.
You need to log in to Alexa with your Amazon account in the boAt Wave App.

There are 100+ watch faces in the wave app, which you can use to customize your watch with whatever that suits your personality. You can even use your own pictures. However, you cannot customize the time font if you choose to do that, which, in my opinion, is quite limiting.

Notifications in the watch is pretty cool, and comes in handy when you do not wish to open your phone for it. Call alerts come, and you can reject them but not accept. Makes sense as the watch does not have a speaker. It vibrates.

It has a good build quality and is water-resistant.

Other cool features are sleep tracking, breathing exercise, alarms, timers, flashlights etc.

Overall, a pretty decent watch if you are looking for something in this range of price."
9349,4.0,Good battery 🔋 bkup.....also u can rec. Notification of whtup nd insta etc on screen
9350,4.0,Everything is good but once bluetooth connection disconnected then it won't connect automatically.. 😒
9351,4.0, Like as it shows time for what I ordered it
9352,4.0,"It's over all a good product. Battery runs 7 days non-stop after fully charged. Notifications work. Screen movement is not fluid don't expect at this price. But its still overpriced because these functions are available with other brands with lower range. I bought for 2999. So depends on you.
Works fine even in dusty or heavy rainfall. Belt quality is really sturdy. Screen glass is very good quality, almost many times I hit railings or equipments. I work in such environment. No scratches at all.
I'm satisfied with the tracking and sensors. Almost 95% accuracy.
I just wish manufacturers give an option of switching off the Bluetooth on the watch when not needed, just a food for thought."
9353,4.0,"Good product, I liked. Worth for the money,
Good battery life"
9354,4.0,Product is good for regular use. Nice looking watch. Shouldn’t expect much at this price point.

9356,4.0,Watch is good but calling feature is not that good can be neglected looking at price.
9357,4.0,Nice product
9358,4.0,"I am a very huge fan of boat especially there service and warranty they never let their customers down asusual good

One tip - Dont use too much of watch faces in the app it has less storage so u avoid lag in a watch"
9359,4.0,"For the price it is good, looks pretty, but poor accuracy"
9360,4.0," Used this watch for over a month now.. Bought it during the first sale.. Keep reading for an unbiased review and tips/tricks to ensure all the functions in the watch are working smoothly.
1) Large Curved Display in this price category - 1.69 inch
2) Battery with heavy usage and frequently waking up the screen, alexa, alarms, notifications is about 3 days. On standby while just checking the time occassionally is about 8 days. Pretty good. Full charging time is about 1.5 hours. Decent quality magnetic charging cable provided. Use your own low power adapter, power bank or laptop.
3) Has all the necessary health / workout tracking options.. Spo2( Oxymeter), Heart Rate monitor..Accuracy is 95-98%. Sleep tracking is pretty accurate too. Paedometer is accurate most of the times, but sometimes few hundred steps are added randomly without any activity. This happens randomly once in 3-4 days. Stress Monitor is also there but not sure how it's calculated. The sensors aren not fake most probably because if the watch isn't in contact with your skin it will display a warning message and won't display data.
4) Lift to wake up gesture works but with a 1 second delay.. which is manageable. It has Tap to wake functionality too.
5) Works with most popular notifications: Whatsapp, SMS, Facebook, Instagram etc. Can read the entire SMS on watch and most of the other messages unless it's very long.
6) Calls can't be picked up or silenced.. You can only see the caller id and reject the call.
7) BT Music Control, Weather ☁️ update and Alexa are other usable smart features.
8) 50 different watch face are available on the Boat wave app. Some are really good.. You can also have customised wallpapers as watch faces . See the posted pictures.
9) The Boat Wave app is neatly organized and syncs health data without any issues instantly. The app also has assisted GPS functionality which can track your running activities on a map, in case you need that data.
10) The User Interface is smooth.. Please note that it's not laggy. The animations and transitions are a little slow but overall easy to use. Touch screen response is excellent and feels nice.
11) Overall construction is sturdy and feels nice and comfortable to wear it. It has water resistance of 5 ATM.. Can take it for a short duration swim in a pool, under the shower or rain without any worries. Watch uppper body is brushed aluminium and under body is good quality plastic. The straps are soft and also of very good quality. It doesn't irritate your skin even after wearing it for long durations. Four colour options are available with equally matching straps.. Straps can be easily replaced with fancy straps.

Yes, Alexa on your watch getting you the information is a little slow, takes about 30 -40 seconds to process your request but it's convenient and better that taking out the phone from your pocket which might take similar amount of time or longer.

I find the display quality of the Boat Xtend Smartwatch to be better than the previous smartwatch from Boat. View angle is good on this one, and you can clearly see content on this smartwatch even in the sunlight. The color on this one is not very saturated, but this isn’t something that we can complain about in this price range.

Watch UI And Features
The UI of this smartwatch is clean and easy to use. There is a single button on the watch which works as the power/off button as well as the back button. Moreover, the display is a touchscreen display that works without any problem. There isn’t much animation on the bar menu, and the navigation is simple, so you won’t find it difficult to use. However, the watch may lag a bit. The company has done cost-cutting in terms of the processor, that’s why you may find it to lag a bit, but it is OK, and not a big deal at the price point you get it.

Boat Xtend Ui
The watch offers all the basic fitness features such as daily activity (which includes total steps walked, calories burnt, and time), heart rate, sleep tracking, stress tracking breath training, SpO2 training, meditation, find my phone, and music control. Apart from that, there are 14 different support modes on this watch. I tried a few of them, and they worked fine. The watch notifies you of the incoming calls, messages received, and various other notifications in detail.

Alexa Support
The main highlight of the Boat Xtend is the Amazon Alexa Support. The watch has an in-built microphone, and you can access it by long-pressing the back button. Do note that you can only do some basic tasks with Alexa on the watch like setting an alarm, setting a timer, and such. Well, it is a good thing to have Alexa on a watch, but you won’t find it very useful. Probably you will use it for a day or two out of excitement, and then you won’t prefer using it because it only does some basic tasks. So, even if Boat missed this feature, it won’t be a problem.

Boat Xtend Alexa support
Watch Faces
The next cool thing about this Boat Smartwatch is the watch faces you get on this one. You get more than 100 watch faces on the watch, and probably more watch faces will be added to it. Moreover, you can also set a custom watch face as well.

Boat Wave App
You will have to download the Boat Wave App to use the watch. The app is available for both Android as well as iOS devices. You won’t be seeing bugs on the app, and it works perfectly. I haven’t noticed any problem with connectivity like frequent disconnection. The interface of the Boat Wave is clean and simple. You will get all the fitness-related options and all the watch settings on the app itself.

Accuracy
Accuracy is one of the important aspects that one should take care of when buying a smartwatch. So talking about the accuracy, I tested everything on this watch, from normal walking to running, sleeping, and much more, and I find the results to be accurate.

Boat Xtend accuracy test
Compared to Realme or Redmi Watch, the result was the same on all of them. So, there is no problem with the accuracy. I don’t find the results to be accurate on most of the budget fitness trackers, but yes, this smartwatch is accurate in terms of fitness tracking, sleep tracking, and everything it does.

Boat Xtend accuracy
Comparing it to the Noise watch which we tried recently, the stress level as well as the SpO2 tracking is much more accurate on this one. It also has the option to track the menstrual cycle in women.

Battery
You get to see a 300mAH battery on this one, which the company claims to last 7 days. However, if you use most of the features of the watch, then the battery will last about two and a half days. If you keep the brightness low, then the battery will last about 3-4 days. I find the battery life to be a downside of the watch. It comes with magnet hook charging support.

Final Words
Boat Xtend Smartwatch is a decent smartwatch from the Boat. It offers all the basic fitness features you will find on a budget fitness tracker, a good display, Alexa support, good design and build, and much more. The smartwatch at this price is quite good. Personally, what I didn’t like about this smartwatch is its color scheme. However, if you like the color scheme, then I would recommend you to go for it. Overall the watch is good with nothing to dislike about it except for the battery life. The battery life on this one is quite low. The company claims it to have a battery life of 7 days, but with regular usage, it will last for 2-3 days. If you are looking for a good smartwatch under Rs.5000, and you can adjust with the battery life, and you like the color scheme, then I would recommend you to go for this smartwatch. It offers all the features that should be there in a smartwatch under Rs.5000."
9362,4.0,"Pros:

1. Premium build quality with matte finishing- sturdy polycarbonate frame, good soft silicone straps that r absolutely flush with the body of the watch. Attractive, trendy colours.
2. Heart Rate (except heart rate spikes in weight training), Pedometer(steps counter) are accurate but SPO2 is off by +/- 2% when compared to Pulse Oximeter readings. But most smart watches offer the same accuracy. Sleep tracking is accurate only for bed time & wake up time, duration but stages of sleep are inaccurate. Light, deep sleep, waking detected but no REM sleep detected. Sleep data from the watch synchronises smoothly with Boat Wave app. Issues warning msg if watch not worn on hand properly and does not detect data of surfaces.
3. Large (1.69""), clear bright, sharp LCD IPS display even in the sun.
4. Touch not smooth, experienced jitters. UI also lags at times & after attaching the tempered glass sometimes some functions require 02-03 taps to work. But acceptable scrolling response if finger moved diagonally instead of vertically.
5. In app GPS works superbly. Excellent route tracking on the map. This feature is not advertised in their description.
6. Bluetooth 5.0 connectivity is good if mobile is kept in close proximity(7m). The Boat Wave app must remain running in the background at all times.
7. Definitely splash proof though did'nt take the risk of submerging the watch.
8. All notifications are working, no problem with call alerts or SMS msgs or social media app notifications. No lags at all though there is provision for a 3 sec lag which can be turned on.
9. Alexa works superbly but since there is no speaker, info is displayed on the screen. My Wipro Smart Bulb, FireTV stick can be controlled easily using the inbuilt Alexa on the watch. Alexa can do mathematical calculations, currency conversions, even foreign language translations, apart from supplying info on anything under the sun. But ofcourse, Alexa cannot make calls. Alexa can set alarm, timer also.
10. Sedentary alert, drinking water reminder, stress alert, menstrual cycle alert, alarms, timers function well.
11. Boat Wave app connects easily & no lags observed. Data syncs smoothly with Google Fit app. Excellent health reports and motivational rewards system in the form of badges. But settings can be changed only through the app and the watch needs to be restarted for the new settings to be effective.
12. Training, Sports modes r good.
13. Guided Breathing mode is also good.
14. Find my phone works well.
15. Extremely stylish, light weight & comfortable for all day wear.
16. 07 watch faces available in the device with 04 preset which cannot be deleted. The rest can be changed from the Boat Wave app.

Cons:

1. Lacks vibration intensity control.
2. Lacks Camera control shutter. But can't figure out its use as my handset accepts both voice commands & gestures to click pics.
3. No quick reply messages for notifications/call alerts.
4. No call acceptance or silencing feature. A work around can be if bluetooth handset is connected at the same time.
5. SPO2 is not accurate and sometimes freezes at 97%. But this is common in all smart watches.
6. Battery does'nt last more than 03 days if continuous HR measurement is turned on. Otherwise easily lasts for 7 days.
7. Watch faces are very childish. Expected better quality designs. Company can easily improve on this in their next update.
8. Amazon Prime only replacement, no refund policy is not good. At least colour change should be allowed once.
9. Music control feature does not display the title of the song.
10. No BP monitoring or temperature monitoring feature. Smart watches usually do not provide reliable BP data.
11. No calling feature. But it does'nt matter as most don't want conversations to be public.
12. A bit large for narrow wrists, band @22 mm is a bit wide.
13. Company should provide a tempered glass protector. No mention of protective glass on the display mentioned. Have attached a Scot tempered glass purchased separately.
14. There are actually only 10 sports modes. Boat has bloated the list with Indoor-Outdoor combi of 4 sports (Walking, Running, Swimming, Cycling).
15. There is no light sensor. Auto brightness is only time dependant but works well.

Was a wedding anniversary gift for my wife who liked it very much even the colour- the evergreen, classic gold-black. Overall the best smart watch with Alexa built in, available at the budget price point of under Rs 3000. An excellent Fitness Tracker but average Health Monitor."
9363,4.0,"First I want to tell.
1.The watch want to update first either it will not work, so it reqest to seller to check the product before selling.

2. The product is very good and satisfied according to price.

3. I will suggest to purchase it. Coz all is better.

4. But seller should check the product before selling to customers.

5. Coz I had return it first then after I recived it, it better coz the device is not updated.

9397,4.0,"Alexa is not works in it, This is bad whats the importance of giving it."
9398,4.0,"I have received this product a couple of days ago and now I am going to give an honest review of it.

This product is a great item if you are looking for a budget smartwatch. For its price, it provides quite accurate measurements of your BPM, stress, SPO2 etc. I have verified it's measurements with an actual oximeter and it proved to be accurate. However, the pedometer of the watch randomly adds around 100 steps. The pedometer is accurate otherwise.

The touch display of the 1.69"" watch impressed me. The watch has a sharp display, and smooth touch, which makes you feel like you are on a smartphone. The response time is quite well too. However, the animations lag which is not very eye pleasing, but workable.

The battery is great. The watch would be powered on for one whole night and would not lose a single percent of battery. Even while using, it loses a reasonable amount of power. For first time users, who just received their product: You might notice the battery is draining extremely quick. Do not panic. It is recommended to charge the battery for at least 2 hours before first use. It stabilizes the battery. The next time you use your watch, it would work as normal.

The built-in Alexa is perhaps my favorite feature of this watch. It's response time is around 5 seconds, and is quite fun to use a virtual assistant on the go. It can tell you facts, jokes, weather, calculations, translations and loads of other stuff, which might be useful for quickly looking up something. However, Alexa does not have a speaker. It gives a text output. The text output can sometimes end with ""..."" (ellipses) which mean the output is too long to print. It can also fail to provide relevant output at times.
You need to log in to Alexa with your Amazon account in the boAt Wave App.

There are 100+ watch faces in the wave app, which you can use to customize your watch with whatever that suits your personality. You can even use your own pictures. However, you cannot customize the time font if you choose to do that, which, in my opinion, is quite limiting.

Notifications in the watch is pretty cool, and comes in handy when you do not wish to open your phone for it. Call alerts come, and you can reject them but not accept. Makes sense as the watch does not have a speaker. It vibrates.

It has a good build quality and is water-resistant.

Other cool features are sleep tracking, breathing exercise, alarms, timers, flashlights etc.

Overall, a pretty decent watch if you are looking for something in this range of price."
9399,4.0,Good battery 🔋 bkup.....also u can rec. Notification of whtup nd insta etc on screen
9400,4.0,Everything is good but once bluetooth connection disconnected then it won't connect automatically.. 😒

9402,4.0,"It's over all a good product. Battery runs 7 days non-stop after fully charged. Notifications work. Screen movement is not fluid don't expect at this price. But its still overpriced because these functions are available with other brands with lower range. I bought for 2999. So depends on you.
Works fine even in dusty or heavy rainfall. Belt quality is really sturdy. Screen glass is very good quality, almost many times I hit railings or equipments. I work in such environment. No scratches at all.
I'm satisfied with the tracking and sensors. Almost 95% accuracy.
I just wish manufacturers give an option of switching off the Bluetooth on the watch when not needed, just a food for thought."

9537,4.0,"- Has all basic features of a digital watch and some more to call it smartwatch.
- Touch screen responsiveness is good.
- Notifications for selected apps on phone is helpful.
- Call reject is also helpful, for example, while driving.
- There's no speaker or mic on this watch, so no Bluetooth calling (I didn't want BT calling).
- Music controls work with some music apps but I didn't find it good enough to use it often.
- Can't say much about accuracy of SpO2 sensor or the heart rate sensor. They do show some data and I am still trying to verify how good that data is.
- The step counter is nuts. Not reliable. It overcounts steps.
- There's absolutely no storage in this thing for spare watch faces or recording vitals and health data so if you're not connected to the phone, all data is probably getting lost. It does support syncing with Google fit which is reliably picking up data without me fiddling with it.
- If you pair with another phone watch face gets reset to default one which is pretty stupid.
- It took some getting used to the short screen timeout but I like that it conserves battery and keeps going for a week or more on single charge.
- The tilt sensor to turn screen on (the raise to wake thing) is nice and useful.
- 4 screen brightness levels are good.
- Watch face customisation feature seems like they've played a joke on me. It's crappy. I'd have liked watch face additions on app updates, none so far in about a month of using this.
- The strap is holding on good so far. I'd have liked a more skin-friendly strap because I tend to wear it more often than my analog watch.

EDIT (06-09-2022):
- I recently found that other Noise smartwatches have camera trigger function which is sorely missing from this one.
- The sports modes are way too specific and there are only 8 of them; they should have added a generic one for activities not included in the 8 available.

Of course now this is also unavailable. Good for you."

So bad"
9598,4.0,"The watch is great for the price. Most things work great. Has great battery life. As a dailywear, there's not much to worry about. It detects activity but that happens only after a considerable amount of time (20 minutes). One cannot change the activity detection sensitivity or time.

The watch is not very intuitive to use. It's usually great and most features can be accessed easily but certain things take more clicks and taps than should be required in a compact device. So all the features are there, but it takes a bit of time to find them.
Sleep tracking is decent.

Phone calls have good quality. People can hear your voice even if there is reasonable disturbance. If you answered through your phone and now want to switch to your watch, you cannot do that. And you can only save at most 10 contacts. You cannot dial numbers. But the mic and speaker of the watch is good

Also, a confusing thing is, why does the watch not have audio alarms, when it is capable of producing sound?"
9599,4.0,"good one i got this 1399 ... i write this review after 2 month usage .. battery is awesome if u not connected with phone it gives 10 days while connected in phone it battery life become 4 or 5 days .. if u need accurate calculate your heart beat ,walk pls go with another its worthy but not accurate , calling function and u can speak through connected with your phone dont expect high quality in call but its not bad it become average it has 150 plus watch faces and you can customise with your photos . mainly some time its failed with you connect with mobile ,i mainly facing this issue , and but at this price it's value for money budget friendly watch i will suggest for budget buys with bluetooth caling future ..."
9600,4.0,"I have tried BOAT and FIREBOLT also and found this as the best so returned the other two.
I will discuss the pros and cons but before that I must say that the accuracy of readings are pathetic especially sleep monitoring .
All the smartwatches in the market at this price range doesn't give accurate results as smartbands... I am disappointed with that .. but why I finally chose to keep the Noise buzz and return boat wave lite and FIREBOLT ninja call pro ----

Pros
1. Good battery life , better than FIREBOLT ninja which was about 2 days.. Noise gives almost 3 to 4 days battery life with normal usage.
2. Calling is quite good quality ( FIREBOLT was also good )
3. The settings of DND , SMART DND, SILENT , VIBRATION is better.
4. Vibration is good and really wakes u up unlike the other watches where vibration can't be adjusted and doesn't wake you up.. here vibration can be adjusted if you want more or less amount.

Cons
1. Pathetic accuracy. Don't take this watch if you are only looking for sleep monitoring , heart beat etc. It's better to buy a good smartband for that.
2. Interface is not the best but it's okay

I bought this calling watch for 1700 in the great Indian festival and I feel at this price range it was the best as I have used Boat wave lite(non calling watch at 1200) and FIREBOLT ninja call pro ( 1800rs ) .I finally decided to keep the Noise and return the rest."
9601,4.0,"After 1 month of use I feel this wat h is value for money as it provide calling under 2k

Missing features at same price point are
1. Voice asst
2. Calculator
3. Games
4. Bp

Notifications stay like messages and have to be deleted like messages once in watch and again in phone.
Bluetooth calling is more like a tws earphone a separate function, but cannot play music or other streaming other than phone calls. Not even whatsapp calls. Practically nothing more than a show off. Wrist turn awake to show time is a good feature especially with disable feature at night but it takes a second to turn on which is slow.
Auto detection of workouts did show up after 5 mins of walking but never recorded anything. Reminders are not repeatable. Alarms cannot be named. Watch faces are not impressive.

Strap is plugbin type and notnpin type so is proprietary and not generic pin type.

Unable to return it for better deals even if not happy with features/performance"
9611,4.0,"This my first smart watch I have owned, though I am not a tech paralyse. I know am a bit techie, therefore here is my review.
pros -
1. Easy to use and easy to connect.
2. Accurate data analysied.
3. Never disconnect in calls, just one tap connect.
4. Basic interference to use.
5. Bluetooth is good.
6. yes this is waterproof, went in shower with this on nothing happen but dont over do it.
7. Good watch faces could add more.

cons -
1. Battery life - yes, everyone talking that battery is good, though it is good but was expecting better battery life. with call features on max 2 days it can restarin.
2. Could add a ringtone ! my personal choice.
3. wrist awake feature is not good.

conclusion - This watch is good in this price but not best in class. If you can spend more you will get better watch this."

9694,4.0,"The watch is extremely affordable as it just cost me Rs. 1999. The watch's strap is of a pretty good quality and makes you feel comfortable when worn. The watch's capsule is made up of pure stainless steel. Whenever someone looks at the watch, they aren't able to tell that it only cost me 2K bucks, as the display of the watch, gives an expensive vibe. But, the screen of the watch hasn't covered the whole glass (as shown on the cover of the box of the watch). Pixels of the watch could have been improved & they could have added one or two more games too! Spo2, Heart Rate, steps, weather & sleep tracker are quite accurate, would have rated it a 5/5 if they wouldn't have had done fake marketing of the product. But, if you have a budget of 2000 in your mind, then this watch has been designed for you, my friend!"

The problem's that I faced using this watch is that the battery of this watch is not really that great, you get a maximum of 3 days and a few hours of battery life. Mind you that I have disabled everything, including the vibration, phone and the brightness reduced to nearly 10%. So if you want a better battery, don't take this. And second is that since this one has a call feature, it has a really annoying and very loud tune that rings when someone calls you and there is no option of muting that ring or any sorts. The rest, like I said 3.8⭐"

Watch is good looking too. I haven't test the sleep tracking yet. But my bro will surely tell the sleep tracking experience and I'll edit this review. The only bad (actually worst) thing about this watch is that the sensors are fully fake. I tested it on a table and it shows that the table has 78 bpm. If you wear it you will also get the same result. Watch is quite good, you could go for it if you are not looking for a heart beat, SpO2 sensing watch because they are worst."
9711,4.0," I am writing this detailed review after using this product for a week:

Build Quality: It is metal body but not the pure metal material, overall build quality is good.

Screen: Amazing experience with screen, even it is not Amoled display but you will not feel the need as brightness is sufficient when wants to use in Sunlight. Touch is very smooth but you will get scratches on screen easily. Wakeup function was not working initially but worked pretty well after resetting.

Accuracy: Most of the Smartwatches measure ghost reading so this does but overall accuracy is good in this budget.

9713,4.0,"The product is good. Only the calling ringtone is not that good. When the incoming call is ringing voice of the ringtone is so high. I tried to silent that but volume doesn't changed. There should be a facility to make it silent or lower the volume.
I will rate this product as 4 star 🌟🌟🌟🌟"

4) Raise to wake is a responsive (8/10)
5) Sleep tracking is decent. (8/10)

Cons...
6) There are a lot of watch faces in dafit app but half of it is boaring (6/10)

7) Do not have option to silent the calls and also the volume of ringtone can't be decreased (feature is available but do not work). (1/10)

8) The biggest problem that I have faced is that the watch is automatically connected to other device if they have dafit.(My watch was connected to random phones two time) and then they can easily change everything on your watch. In other smartwatch first we have to reset the watch to connect to other device 😑😑.

9) Only vibration for alarm, no sound even after having good speaker. (2/10)

Personal suggestion:- If you can spend a bit more then go for FIRE BOLTT rage calling (newly launched) It is better in every aspect but in looks phoenix wins."

9784,4.0,"Nice looking smart watch with few flaws.
Scope to improve in sleep tracking.
It supports only step cont to share to google fit not sleep and heartbeat.
It should have have option to track blood oxigen mesure during sleep.
Battery could have been better."

9794,4.0,"I have used this watch for a week.
Things i liked:
As an average gym goer, I find it pretty useful. It has no gps. Not totally accurate also. But I wanted a watch which had inbuilt music storage and to remind me to move all day and to drink water which it does very well. I also liked the fastrack reflex world app and the watch display features. Regarding connectivity with the app, if it does not connect immediately, just switching off the Bluetooth and switching it on will solve the issue. I will update battery life after using music features daily. So far with occasional music play.. 3hrs in a week, it lasted for a week
Things I didn't like:
It says the watch display will be on when we lift to view it- good concept but it does not work. Also we have to change the multisport activity, it will not detect automatically.
Pros.
Inbuilt music storage
Good speaker
Sedentary alert- to keep moving all day
Hydration alert
Cons.
Not accurate
No gps
Display.. lift to view"

9917,4.0,"- Has all basic features of a digital watch and some more to call it smartwatch.
- Touch screen responsiveness is good.
- Notifications for selected apps on phone is helpful.
- Call reject is also helpful, for example, while driving.
- There's no speaker or mic on this watch, so no Bluetooth calling (I didn't want BT calling).
- Music controls work with some music apps but I didn't find it good enough to use it often.
- Can't say much about accuracy of SpO2 sensor or the heart rate sensor. They do show some data and I am still trying to verify how good that data is.
- The step counter is nuts. Not reliable. It overcounts steps.
- There's absolutely no storage in this thing for spare watch faces or recording vitals and health data so if you're not connected to the phone, all data is probably getting lost. It does support syncing with Google fit which is reliably picking up data without me fiddling with it.
- If you pair with another phone watch face gets reset to default one which is pretty stupid.
- It took some getting used to the short screen timeout but I like that it conserves battery and keeps going for a week or more on single charge.
- The tilt sensor to turn screen on (the raise to wake thing) is nice and useful.
- 4 screen brightness levels are good.
- Watch face customisation feature seems like they've played a joke on me. It's crappy. I'd have liked watch face additions on app updates, none so far in about a month of using this.
- The strap is holding on good so far. I'd have liked a more skin-friendly strap because I tend to wear it more often than my analog watch.

EDIT (06-09-2022):
- I recently found that other Noise smartwatches have camera trigger function which is sorely missing from this one.
- The sports modes are way too specific and there are only 8 of them; they should have added a generic one for activities not included in the 8 available.

Of course now this is also unavailable. Good for you."

9945,4.0,3 days without charge its amazing but one thing i dont like about it is that it can not count accurate steps touch display is awesome

9961,5.0,"- Has all basic features of a digital watch and some more to call it smartwatch.
- Touch screen responsiveness is good.
- Notifications for selected apps on phone is helpful.
- Call reject is also helpful, for example, while driving.
- There's no speaker or mic on this watch, so no Bluetooth calling (I didn't want BT calling).
- Music controls work with some music apps but I didn't find it good enough to use it often.
- Can't say much about accuracy of SpO2 sensor or the heart rate sensor. They do show some data and I am still trying to verify how good that data is.
- The step counter is nuts. Not reliable. It overcounts steps.
- There's absolutely no storage in this thing for spare watch faces or recording vitals and health data so if you're not connected to the phone, all data is probably getting lost. It does support syncing with Google fit which is reliably picking up data without me fiddling with it.
- If you pair with another phone watch face gets reset to default one which is pretty stupid.
- It took some getting used to the short screen timeout but I like that it conserves battery and keeps going for a week or more on single charge.
- The tilt sensor to turn screen on (the raise to wake thing) is nice and useful.
- 4 screen brightness levels are good.
- Watch face customisation feature seems like they've played a joke on me. It's crappy. I'd have liked watch face additions on app updates, none so far in about a month of using this.
- The strap is holding on good so far. I'd have liked a more skin-friendly strap because I tend to wear it more often than my analog watch.

EDIT (06-09-2022):
- I recently found that other Noise smartwatches have camera trigger function which is sorely missing from this one.
- The sports modes are way too specific and there are only 8 of them; they should have added a generic one for activities not included in the 8 available.

Of course now this is also unavailable. Good for you."

10068,4.0,"Today only i recieved this watch at first instance it win my heart ....
I was using it a whole day and i found some pros and cons of this watch
Pros
# Amoled Display is very bright and nice
# Look and design is premium
# Bluetooth calling is awesome, speaker is loud and clear . Even my voice is reaching to opposite party very clearly while calling with watch.
# calculator features is useful
# Multi Functional crown button is easy and useful .. Easily to change theme with just scroll the crown button
# play music directly from the watch with the internal storage although its only 128 mb but sufficient to store around 10 songs approx.. song sound quality is also fine
# strap quality is good and soft
# TWS connecting features is also nice

Cons
# sometimes i found watch is disconnected with my phone ..not sure why its happened as i have checked only for one day
# fingerprints are clearly visible on Screen Glass .. i have attached the pic for it
#Health Tracker are near to accurate but never rely on smartwatch at this price range.i have measure the bp with this watch and with bp machine both results are different... 70-80% accurate only..
# AI Voice assistant is not very useful as it only work for mobile when i press the voice assistant button on watch .. like if i give command to set alarm on watch it set alarm on mobile so basically it just a button to wake up google assistant for mobile phone.
#Sometimes when you pick call from your mobile phone call automatically transfer to watch and voice started coming from the watch speaker.. which is quite irritating
..this must be correct by firmware updates

i have purchased it for Rs.3420/- including bank offer . For this price range overall its a good & premium watch ..
Its my experience with this watch for just a one day
Rest how it work for long run that depends.."
10069,4.0,"Recieved a damaged device at first... Slight gap between display and body from the left side.. but quickly recieved the replacement next day....

The replacement was good...
Amazon provided great service and delivered replacement in just 16 hours ...so great job amazon..also i live in bangalore.. so the experience might vary from place to place..

Pros
Smooth enough UI
Fairly accurate readings on all the sensors
Heartrate BP and spo2

Call quality is great for the price.. good speakers and good mic..

You can control spotify and soundcloud music too from the watch .and use tws to listen to spotify while controling with the watch... And it is seamless...

Display is great ..colors are punchy and bezels are good enough... Not as narrow as crossbeats ignite s4 max but still good enough...

Build quality is good but does not feel very premium.. it does feel like a below 5k watch...
So you cannot trick anyone that this is a apple watch 😂

Strap is not too long as every review mentions.. strap is good enough... Not too comfy..
I ordered a metal strap from amazon for my watch and it is amazing...

Ui looks much better in person than reviews.. UI is smooth and looks good... Not as good as realme watch 3 pro..
But still good for the price..

Overall its a good watch for the price of around 3.5k -3.9k
Anymore and it is not worth the price

Realme watch 3pro is the best at around this price.. so if you get that in stock and for below 4k then get realme watch 3 pro..
Or else for this price segment firebolt visionary is the overall best watch compared to all other watches under 4k

Cons
Call when recieved on watch doesnt stay on tws it switches to watch for some reason..which is one

Steps are a little inaccurate and reads steps even if not walking..so dont rely on step counter

Battery life is not great if youre using always on display and calling... Maybe around 3 days
But otherwise battery stays for over 5 days.

Blutooth range is not too good.. and varies from watch to watch.. and also phone to phone.. i get a decent bluetooth range of around 20 ft .. but this is more of a fact than a con.."

- drink water reminder feature is good.
- Decent number of watch faces in Da Fit app.
- Heartbeat, steps counting, spo2 & bp sensor is almost accurate.

Cons
- with always on display, battery is not that great & can be better.
- missing the inbuilt gps.
- Screen easily picks up fingerprints.
- charging cable can be bit longer. When fully charged, there some sort of alarm to remove from charging."
10071,4.0,Overall good product but the best of the watch is not a great quality i should say or maybe my perticular peace is having a Problem I'm not sure but the belt is tearing slowly.its not even 4 months since I've Baugh this watch and I already need to go service the water to replace the straps. Make sure your product is in good condition and check properly before the return policy expires. Except for that i think its an effortable watch.
10072,4.0,"Fire bolt visionary is a good smartwach to buy, containing various features as BP, heart rate and SPO2 monitoring, sound quality of watch is good and voice is clear while making a audio call or listening to music on it. The if and buts in it which I don't like is while connecting it to phone with Bluetooth sometimes it takes a long time to connect while phone shows already paired but watch gives u message to pair it to phone than u hv to forget it from phone bluetooth settings and pair it again that 2 sometimes takes time, battery backup remains for around one and half day if watch is continuously paired with Bluetooth. BP and heart rate monitoring system is not very accurate and varies when compared with BP instrument to around 10. Overall a good experience of mine with it and will rate it 4/5"
10073,4.0,"1. Charging cable is too small
2. While charging it doesn't show how much it has charged neither in the app nor in the watch. We have to stop the charging and then check how much it has charged.

3. While charging it doesn't allow to use any of the features ot just shows the time and that it's charging.
4. (Optional) can the cable be not like other mobile chargers?."

10088,4.0,"Purchased this on 24th Aug for Rs 3499, received it on 25th Aug and have been using this continuously since.

Detailed review after 12 days

Initial observation - the watch looks stylish - with the screen on and the screen off. (no doubt about it)

Display is really a stunner! very bright and very sharp. My Reason to buy this was for the AMOLED display and it performed beyond my expectation.

Raise to wake lag IS PRESENT - but not a dealbreaker as one would get used to and time the raising of their wrists accordingly to minimize the lag. I got used to it with practice so you would be too. (Hopeful that this will be fixed with the OTA update).

Watchfaces - limited but good. Was wondering if there was a way to remove the Virat Kohli watchface from the 10 base watch faces pack in the watch. (Although i like VK but somehow would wish there was a way to remove it) Only 1 watchface can be customized and personal pics can be used there.

BATTERY - TOO GOOD!!!! especially for an AMOLED watch with so many features. When received it on 25th and turned it on, the battery charge level was at 71. I put it on charge to test the cable provided, and within a few mins it reached 91%. I unplugged it then. I charged it again when it went to 0 on Sep 4 after heavy usage for 10 days. Note: Always On Display (AOD) does suck up quite a lot of battery so use it accordingly.

Always on Display (AOD) - Visible only at night. (DIRE NEED OF SOFTWARE UPDATE TO FIX THIS)

Steps counter - VERY BAD! (The primary reason why I am asking you to wait till the next software update and hopefully it will be released soon). Steps counter sensor calculates steps even when you are sleeping and funnily even when you are driving or sitting in the car and not actually walking! If you want a device that can give u an accurate step count of your walking or running etc. modes - THEN SKIP THIS ONE!!! DO NOT BUY IT YET.

sleep tracking - NOT accurate at all.

Heart rate sensor - Moderately accurate - not bad and does the work well.

BP Sensor - Moderately accurate - okayish.

SPo2 - Moderately accurate - okayish.

Bluetooth connectivity - very good. No issues faced at all. No BT drops. My phone is iPhone 12.

Bluetooth calling - very good. no drops or lag. Good output from speaker (Music playback is also loud enough).

In-built games present - Yes (Manufacture and month of import - August 2022)

Crown ring and honeycomb menu functions - Both are smooth and no complains so far.

Default watch straps are good and soft. But changed the straps to metal band for look. 44mm apple straps fit well without any issues.

TWS connectivity not tried yet as need didn’t arise but will try it soon.

OVERALL VERDICT

If price = Rs. 4999, then skip. Wait for sale to buy it below Rs. 3700.

If price = Rs. 3500 then you could buy it as it is a decent AMOLED BT calling smartwatch at 3500 price point. But still my suggestion would be to wait for the company to resolve the bugs and issues through OTA update, and then buy. Hopeful for OTA update soon but no news from Fireboltt company so far.

Company only launching new smartwatches fixing the Visionary’s problems but not releasing software updates to fix Visionary’s problems. This kind of strategy is not good for companies establishing their presence in the market as a long-term player."
10089,4.0,"Pros. : Good looking smart watch. Liked the smart feature like calculator, sleeping cycle, Breathing practice, BP measure, analogue AOD, games, Blutooth calling. Awesome feature. Cons: Just unsatisfied with Raise on wake feature, step calculation on bed also, some time connectivity issue and want to play music on phone but sound coming from watch, same for Call also.
Suggestion : During connectivity we can control music but option should be here to play in phone.

Accuracy can be improve in step count and BP.

Breathing practice should also have some more options."

But the sleep tracker doesn't do the job automatically. The speaker quality isn't that Great and the app needs to be improved."

10094,4.0,"It is a very smartwatch at this price range. It has all the features like Sleep tracking, Steps, BP, SPO2, Bluetooth calling and much more."
10095,3.0,"I was very confused because of 100+ Options available, But then I Decided to finally get this “Fire-boltt Visiornary” for 2 main reasons which You dont get any other in this price range,
1) AMOLED Display
2) Internal Storage for Tws Paring.

The touch is great, feels premium with the metal body, strap is okayish does the job, I love that came with all necessary apps and 2Games too, the Dedicated Crown works like a charm, The best feature in my case is Customised Watch face as you can see I my Favourite Batman wallpaper there.

Highlights -
* Colours are punchy and sharp.
* Speakers are better then expected.
* Mic is also Good.

Cons - Didn’t notice anything so far just one thing once you connect the Call Setting to Your phone, It automatically turns on randomly even if you turned it off, My solution to that is Forgot the Audio device from Bluetooth settings, you still keep the main watch connected which tracks all stuff in phone. I am not gonna use Bluetooth calling everyday. That my preference. Overall it best deal right to get it in Deals like 3799/- because usually 4999/- on normal days."

1- bezel can be smaller.
2- Stop using those actors for promoting the product (on the box) and wallpaper it simply give the user cheap Vibes.
4. No option to delete the wallpaper (The one with Virat on it) the fact that it can have 10 wallpapers ig, is good but all are locked so only 1 can be edited and 1 can be changed please give the user the freedom to choose all 10 of them it would be good.
5. sensors r good but sometimes it shows heart rate of non-living things.
6. The most important is that you guys really Need To Release Your Own App cause this Da Fit is not good.

The unique feature Bluetooth calling and receiving is amazing..... Good clarity of speaker and mic....."
10108,4.0," Mark this review helpful if you find this helpful.

CONS:
You can customise only one and additionally add another one watch face. 10 default watch faces all of them suckk.. overall the watch is pretty useable, the sleep data isn't accurate. Heart rate and spO2 may be nearly okay.... Looks wise it's good. Not the greatest UI, speakers are good, but may annoy when using with phone because it constantly starts playing audio on watch it's annoying. Also it keeps unpairing with the phone ... You need to tap on call component each time you wanna pair with device again to use assistant and all.... Call quality is not bad.
PROS:
Always on display is good enough indoors. Sports modes are just there.... Let's be honest, nobody uses them. Overall the feel is comfortable and the build quality is nice, the magnetic charger is satisfying. you can store 10-14 good quality songs or about 20 medium quality songs to listen offline without your phone and it provides support for Bluetooth earbuds even without the phone...thats what TWS is all about. Pretty good feature. And it is IP68 water resistant. (Don't use soap to clean tho). You need to connect the watch with its charger to your laptop or computer to put in songs. It is light weight but not thaaat light...you can feel it's weight on your wrist. Looks like an apple watch from a distance.

Again can't expect more from such a budget watch.

Overall, a good deal for ₹3799."

10118,4.0,"Today only i recieved this watch at first instance it win my heart ....
I was using it a whole day and i found some pros and cons of this watch
Pros
# Amoled Display is very bright and nice
# Look and design is premium
# Bluetooth calling is awesome, speaker is loud and clear . Even my voice is reaching to opposite party very clearly while calling with watch.
# calculator features is useful
# Multi Functional crown button is easy and useful .. Easily to change theme with just scroll the crown button
# play music directly from the watch with the internal storage although its only 128 mb but sufficient to store around 10 songs approx.. song sound quality is also fine
# strap quality is good and soft
# TWS connecting features is also nice

Cons
# sometimes i found watch is disconnected with my phone ..not sure why its happened as i have checked only for one day
# fingerprints are clearly visible on Screen Glass .. i have attached the pic for it
#Health Tracker are near to accurate but never rely on smartwatch at this price range.i have measure the bp with this watch and with bp machine both results are different... 70-80% accurate only..
# AI Voice assistant is not very useful as it only work for mobile when i press the voice assistant button on watch .. like if i give command to set alarm on watch it set alarm on mobile so basically it just a button to wake up google assistant for mobile phone.
#Sometimes when you pick call from your mobile phone call automatically transfer to watch and voice started coming from the watch speaker.. which is quite irritating
..this must be correct by firmware updates

i have purchased it for Rs.3420/- including bank offer . For this price range overall its a good & premium watch ..
Its my experience with this watch for just a one day
Rest how it work for long run that depends.."
10119,4.0,"Recieved a damaged device at first... Slight gap between display and body from the left side.. but quickly recieved the replacement next day....

The replacement was good...
Amazon provided great service and delivered replacement in just 16 hours ...so great job amazon..also i live in bangalore.. so the experience might vary from place to place..

Pros
Smooth enough UI
Fairly accurate readings on all the sensors
Heartrate BP and spo2

Call quality is great for the price.. good speakers and good mic..

You can control spotify and soundcloud music too from the watch .and use tws to listen to spotify while controling with the watch... And it is seamless...

Display is great ..colors are punchy and bezels are good enough... Not as narrow as crossbeats ignite s4 max but still good enough...

Build quality is good but does not feel very premium.. it does feel like a below 5k watch...
So you cannot trick anyone that this is a apple watch 😂

Strap is not too long as every review mentions.. strap is good enough... Not too comfy..
I ordered a metal strap from amazon for my watch and it is amazing...

Ui looks much better in person than reviews.. UI is smooth and looks good... Not as good as realme watch 3 pro..
But still good for the price..

Overall its a good watch for the price of around 3.5k -3.9k
Anymore and it is not worth the price

Realme watch 3pro is the best at around this price.. so if you get that in stock and for below 4k then get realme watch 3 pro..
Or else for this price segment firebolt visionary is the overall best watch compared to all other watches under 4k

Cons
Call when recieved on watch doesnt stay on tws it switches to watch for some reason..which is one

Steps are a little inaccurate and reads steps even if not walking..so dont rely on step counter

Battery life is not great if youre using always on display and calling... Maybe around 3 days
But otherwise battery stays for over 5 days.

Blutooth range is not too good.. and varies from watch to watch.. and also phone to phone.. i get a decent bluetooth range of around 20 ft .. but this is more of a fact than a con.."

- drink water reminder feature is good.
- Decent number of watch faces in Da Fit app.

- missing the inbuilt gps.
- Screen easily picks up fingerprints.
- charging cable can be bit longer. When fully charged, there some sort of alarm to remove from charging."
10121,4.0,Overall good product but the best of the watch is not a great quality i should say or maybe my perticular peace is having a Problem I'm not sure but the belt is tearing slowly.its not even 4 months since I've Baugh this watch and I already need to go service the water to replace the straps. Make sure your product is in good condition and check properly before the return policy expires. Except for that i think its an effortable watch.
10122,4.0,"Fire bolt visionary is a good smartwach to buy, containing various features as BP, heart rate and SPO2 monitoring, sound quality of watch is good and voice is clear while making a audio call or listening to music on it. The if and buts in it which I don't like is while connecting it to phone with Bluetooth sometimes it takes a long time to connect while phone shows already paired but watch gives u message to pair it to phone than u hv to forget it from phone bluetooth settings and pair it again that 2 sometimes takes time, battery backup remains for around one and half day if watch is continuously paired with Bluetooth. BP and heart rate monitoring system is not very accurate and varies when compared with BP instrument to around 10. Overall a good experience of mine with it and will rate it 4/5"
10123,4.0,"1. Charging cable is too small
2. While charging it doesn't show how much it has charged neither in the app nor in the watch. We have to stop the charging and then check how much it has charged.

3. While charging it doesn't allow to use any of the features ot just shows the time and that it's charging.
4. (Optional) can the cable be not like other mobile chargers?."

I'll update after using the watch for couple of days !

Edit 1 : after 1 week of using.. decent batter , good speaker for calling and music playback.
Always on display could have been little more brighter. Otherwise doing fine !"

So, In next update they have to fix this problems. 👍"

10138,4.0,"Purchased this on 24th Aug for Rs 3499, received it on 25th Aug and have been using this continuously since.

Detailed review after 12 days

Initial observation - the watch looks stylish - with the screen on and the screen off. (no doubt about it)

Display is really a stunner! very bright and very sharp. My Reason to buy this was for the AMOLED display and it performed beyond my expectation.

Raise to wake lag IS PRESENT - but not a dealbreaker as one would get used to and time the raising of their wrists accordingly to minimize the lag. I got used to it with practice so you would be too. (Hopeful that this will be fixed with the OTA update).

Watchfaces - limited but good. Was wondering if there was a way to remove the Virat Kohli watchface from the 10 base watch faces pack in the watch. (Although i like VK but somehow would wish there was a way to remove it) Only 1 watchface can be customized and personal pics can be used there.

BATTERY - TOO GOOD!!!! especially for an AMOLED watch with so many features. When received it on 25th and turned it on, the battery charge level was at 71. I put it on charge to test the cable provided, and within a few mins it reached 91%. I unplugged it then. I charged it again when it went to 0 on Sep 4 after heavy usage for 10 days. Note: Always On Display (AOD) does suck up quite a lot of battery so use it accordingly.

Always on Display (AOD) - Visible only at night. (DIRE NEED OF SOFTWARE UPDATE TO FIX THIS)

Steps counter - VERY BAD! (The primary reason why I am asking you to wait till the next software update and hopefully it will be released soon). Steps counter sensor calculates steps even when you are sleeping and funnily even when you are driving or sitting in the car and not actually walking! If you want a device that can give u an accurate step count of your walking or running etc. modes - THEN SKIP THIS ONE!!! DO NOT BUY IT YET.

sleep tracking - NOT accurate at all.

Heart rate sensor - Moderately accurate - not bad and does the work well.

BP Sensor - Moderately accurate - okayish.

SPo2 - Moderately accurate - okayish.

Bluetooth connectivity - very good. No issues faced at all. No BT drops. My phone is iPhone 12.

Bluetooth calling - very good. no drops or lag. Good output from speaker (Music playback is also loud enough).

In-built games present - Yes (Manufacture and month of import - August 2022)

Crown ring and honeycomb menu functions - Both are smooth and no complains so far.

Default watch straps are good and soft. But changed the straps to metal band for look. 44mm apple straps fit well without any issues.

TWS connectivity not tried yet as need didn’t arise but will try it soon.

OVERALL VERDICT

If price = Rs. 4999, then skip. Wait for sale to buy it below Rs. 3700.

10258,4.0,"Watch looks great and is lightweight. The strap quality is good . The battery lasts a long time ( more than 7 days on medium usage ) . At the given price point the watch does a decent job of giving the step count, calories feature and reminder's etc. The pulse rate and spo2 counting seems good. The number of step count seems correct based on comparison with previous watches I had but distance covered and calories seem on lower side compared to actual .
Would recommend it since it satisfies the requirement's at a lower price point. Found no issues until now. If you need it for tracking exercise details and use it like a regular watch go for it. Anything more you will need to find something else at higher price point."
10259,4.0," First of all, I have been using this watch for 18days and here's my review about this watch-

Pros:
*The Battery life is totally extraordinary, The last time I fully charged this watch was 18days ago and it still has 32% battery left. Though I only turn it on when I go outside so that might be it but it's really convenient for me!

*No Lags and the pedometer is pretty accurate I'm not sure about the other features but yeah the pedometer is accurate!

*Bright enough to see in harsh sunlight

*Can receive call and messages through Bluetooth which is helpful (and it also vibrates when it receives a call)

Cons:

*The raise to wake feature often fails to turn on the display, you have to twist your whole wrist to wake it up.

*Watch faces are bad, only the one I use and there's one more which is good looking!

*Slow Charging (took 4-5 hour to fully charge)

*The colors are not that punchy because it's not a AMOled pannel

That's it, it's a good smartwatch for only 1.2K RS!"
10260,4.0,"Super happy! Got this smartwatch at ₹1200/- and I guess it's the best smartwatch around this budget. The delivery time was good and the packaging was awesome...The watch is light with 1.69 display and this is better than ever. Used this for 3 days and the performance was quite good!
The brightness was good and the strap was super smooth and nice. Screen touch is decent.
We can also set our custom watch face, it has inbuilt game, calculator, timer, stop watch...and yeah the heart rate monitor and blood oxygen monitor is also there, don't know 'bout the accuracy but I think it's quite good...sports mode was awesome!!

Overall I really recommend this if you want a watch around this budget... Noise Colorfit Pulse Grand is also a good option, but still it's your choice.
Thank you Amazon for good delivery!"
10261,4.0,"After the use of 3 months this watch works good for me, has nice built quality one thing is that it was uncomfortable for me for first 2 days then i adjusted its straps yhen im good to go :)"
10262,4.0,Nice watch but screen size no to edge and screen is also ok ok and sleep tracking is not accurate so this watch is nice in budget but not in tracking
10263,4.0," Box contents: Smartwatch, Charging Cable, Information Leaflets
Pros:
Very good watch with all basic functionalities.
Very premium look with crisp display.
Touch is very responsive with no lags.
Watch my video to explore all functions available in the Smartwatch.
Cons:
Inbuilt Alarm feature is missing in the watch. However, we can set that using Tagg Neo App.
Lack of metal body for watch.

Recommending this purchae within this price range."
10264,4.0,Looks good and navigation is very smooth. Call notifications we get but we unable to make a call and attend. It takes more time to charge and delay in notifications
10265,4.0,Good quality and soft material.
10266,4.0,Good product but need to add more function like calling and custom wallpapers
10267,4.0,"Bought 20 days back after few ground work

Pro's
1) Medium range watch for minimum functions like sedantry reminder, water reminder, steps count
2) battery good mini 7 days charge withstands
3) less weight don't feel watch in hand
4) workout mode and breathe practice so good.

Con's

1) Watch app so low quality features, very cheap watchtaces and slow to select each time

2) Accuracy around 20-30% drop from actual values
3) watch app drains your battery by running background

On conclusion if the watch is needed only for reminders and step count then this is good to go

If watch needed for phone app notification, Bluetooth calling them try other brand watches of around 1500"

The watch is not very intuitive to use. It's usually great and most features can be accessed easily but certain things take more clicks and taps than should be required in a compact device. So all the features are there, but it takes a bit of time to find them.
Sleep tracking is decent.

Phone calls have good quality. People can hear your voice even if there is reasonable disturbance. If you answered through your phone and now want to switch to your watch, you cannot do that. And you can only save at most 10 contacts. You cannot dial numbers. But the mic and speaker of the watch is good

Also, a confusing thing is, why does the watch not have audio alarms, when it is capable of producing sound?"
10353,4.0,"good one i got this 1399 ... i write this review after 2 month usage .. battery is awesome if u not connected with phone it gives 10 days while connected in phone it battery life become 4 or 5 days .. if u need accurate calculate your heart beat ,walk pls go with another its worthy but not accurate , calling function and u can speak through connected with your phone dont expect high quality in call but its not bad it become average it has 150 plus watch faces and you can customise with your photos . mainly some time its failed with you connect with mobile ,i mainly facing this issue , and but at this price it's value for money budget friendly watch i will suggest for budget buys with bluetooth caling future ..."
10354,4.0,"I have tried BOAT and FIREBOLT also and found this as the best so returned the other two.
I will discuss the pros and cons but before that I must say that the accuracy of readings are pathetic especially sleep monitoring .
All the smartwatches in the market at this price range doesn't give accurate results as smartbands... I am disappointed with that .. but why I finally chose to keep the Noise buzz and return boat wave lite and FIREBOLT ninja call pro ----

Pros
1. Good battery life , better than FIREBOLT ninja which was about 2 days.. Noise gives almost 3 to 4 days battery life with normal usage.
2. Calling is quite good quality ( FIREBOLT was also good )
3. The settings of DND , SMART DND, SILENT , VIBRATION is better.
4. Vibration is good and really wakes u up unlike the other watches where vibration can't be adjusted and doesn't wake you up.. here vibration can be adjusted if you want more or less amount.

Cons
1. Pathetic accuracy. Don't take this watch if you are only looking for sleep monitoring , heart beat etc. It's better to buy a good smartband for that.
2. Interface is not the best but it's okay

I bought this calling watch for 1700 in the great Indian festival and I feel at this price range it was the best as I have used Boat wave lite(non calling watch at 1200) and FIREBOLT ninja call pro ( 1800rs ) .I finally decided to keep the Noise and return the rest."
10355,4.0,"After 1 month of use I feel this wat h is value for money as it provide calling under 2k
Point to be noted-if you are buying this watch above 1.5 to 1.7k it's a good choice but more than that you can find other trusted brand like boat or dizo"
10356,4.0,Overall best but Side Button is not working within 2 months maybe it's with my watch
10357,4.0,Overall performance is good but it takes a little long time to connect with phone

10364,4.0,"Bought this at 1699 and was ok with thebfeatires and price but found more advanced features at se
Or lesser price from other brands. Still a good deal.
Missing features at same price point are
1. Voice asst
2. Calculator
3. Games
4. Bp

Notifications stay like messages and have to be deleted like messages once in watch and again in phone.
Bluetooth calling is more like a tws earphone a separate function, but cannot play music or other streaming other than phone calls. Not even whatsapp calls. Practically nothing more than a show off. Wrist turn awake to show time is a good feature especially with disable feature at night but it takes a second to turn on which is slow.
Auto detection of workouts did show up after 5 mins of walking but never recorded anything. Reminders are not repeatable. Alarms cannot be named. Watch faces are not impressive.

Strap is plugbin type and notnpin type so is proprietary and not generic pin type.

Unable to return it for better deals even if not happy with features/performance"
10365,4.0,"This my first smart watch I have owned, though I am not a tech paralyse. I know am a bit techie, therefore here is my review.
pros -
1. Easy to use and easy to connect.
2. Accurate data analysied.
3. Never disconnect in calls, just one tap connect.
4. Basic interference to use.
5. Bluetooth is good.
6. yes this is waterproof, went in shower with this on nothing happen but dont over do it.
7. Good watch faces could add more.

cons -
1. Battery life - yes, everyone talking that battery is good, though it is good but was expecting better battery life. with call features on max 2 days it can restarin.
2. Could add a ringtone ! my personal choice.
3. wrist awake feature is not good.

conclusion - This watch is good in this price but not best in class. If you can spend more you will get better watch this."

10368,4.0,I got it for 1499/- during Great Indian sell. So at this price point it is good. But one thing i do not like is i can't stop it's Bluetooth if i plan to use it as only watch. That drains is battery. Otherwise battery will last much much more than one week.

10568,4.0,"I bought this watch because I thought Alexa inbuilt has a much better option. But unfortunately it doesn’t have speaker. So Alexa understands because of mic available. So for the additional price, it’s better to go for a less price watch since it’s already packed with the features available in this. Not quite impressed."
10569,4.0,"I have raised the complaint for my product, for call and contact details notification issued and , showing massage verification failed when going to connect with aap , now my watch showing call notification and contact but still , showing verification failed when connected with app.
I'm not satisfied with this product"
10570,4.0,"The pros and cons are probably 50/50.
Steps Count - is almost accurate.
Heart Rate - almost accurate.
SPO2 - acuurate.
Stress monitor - accurate.
Sleep monitor - biggest con for me. Has not yet worked for me after sleeping a few nights wearing the watch. It simply says 'no sleep data'.
[Update : Sleep tracking works. The trick is to tie it so tightly that it can not move in your wrist. Also disable the 'raise to wake' mode so that the watch doesn't wake up frequently.]
App - just ok-ish. The 'Colorfit' app has a lot more options than this 'Colorfit Assist'
app.
Watch Faces - the app has a lot of watch
faces but they seem to me mostly for kids and teens. Need a lot more elegant and sophisticated ones.

Overall recommendation - for casual users."

10575,4.0,Value for money
10576,4.0,"Watch is good but the only problem is with its app which do not connect either.
In my case it was connected only first day and now I am struggling to connect with phone.
All noise apps are pathetic."
10577,4.0,"Screen size is good, neither too big nor too small. Accuracy is okay. Overall an okay watch"

Also, the magnetic charger is not that strong.. At the begining itself its loose.."

10580,4.0,"This is my 3rs Noise product and one thing Noise have to work is there Bluetooth connectivity. Like for each of my noise product, I have seen that Bluetooth connectivity is the major issue. I brought earbuds Air 2, face the same problem, I brought Colorfit pro 3, it also has the same problem."
10581,4.0,"I am using Noise ColorFit Pro 3 Assist Smart Watch since November 2021. It has a very good display with good resolution and touch screen. Activity Tracker is good and accurate. Health monitors like Heart Rate Monitor, Blood Oxygen Level (SpO2), Stress Monitor are working fine though not very accurate. Alexa Voice Service, Music Control, Weather, Find Phone Support are useful functions. Very easy to use with NoiseFit Assist app installed in my mobile phone.
Battery: It has a good battery backup, work for 10 days for a full recharge, if you are not using wrist awake function which will increase screen time. When the wrist awake function is ON it will work only for 4-5 days depending upon your usage.
Sleep monitor is not working properly, it works only some days. I had continuously used this function for 10 days (wearing the watch while sleeping) and it worked only in 2 days! Hence, this function is of no use and I am not wearing the watch while sleeping.
Overall it is a good smart watch for the money spent for it."
10582,4.0,I tried to connect with Iphone Os16.0 but failed I tried charging updating and restting watch and iphone but failed to connect iPhone. Although it is working fine with android
10583,4.0,"To all who ever writing the bad reviews.
First try to understand the features and then write the review. Single review will impact many people like me.

Coming to my review.
Initially I thought Alexa is not responding - But, then I have spent 15 mins of time to complete the full configuartions and then I observed a firmware update and completed the upgrade process too.

After all.
1. I can see 100's of face watches to select.
2. Easy access to every app
3. Smooth display (I mean worth for 4k)
4. Light weight
5. Alexa took some time to respond properly, and once it started responding exactly, the assist app is doing the decent job.
6. Screen size is pretty good.

This is my first budget watch purchase, and I can say that quality of the band should have been little better (but again, this will do justice for what we pay).
I observed that when you want to select personalised photo as face app - app is crashing to open the album gallery (I am not sure whether it is the same for all or might be my phone peformance issue. Kindly, others confirm on this issue).

Over all - Noise colorfit pro3 assist will do justice for 4000 (Again, spend sometime before you judge an item).

You need to have super speed to remember it as the instructions on the user manual was not clear. I had to replacement due to that. Be patient for initial config and spare atleast 2-3 hours for the config, one of the worst initial setup I have ever experienced with a wearable device."

10591,4.0,"The watch disconnects with the app after every 2 days. While pairing it again, it says unable to connect and then i have to repeat the entire process of either turn on/off Bluetooth 10 times or just reset the device. Resetting the device makes me lose all my back data so there is no possible way to track any progress.
This sucks big time. Found an alternative to not connect it to the app and use it as it is."

10640,4.0,"Overall it's a budget friendly smartwatch
Pros :
1. Stylish design and comfortable to wear
2. Touchscreen is working well and it gives a faster response too
3. Menu and other options are arranged well
4. Heart rate, spO2 are almost accurate
5. The clarity of mike and speaker are very well
6. The two buttons help to switch into different modes easily.
7. Instant notification from applications
8. There are plenty of watch faces

Cons :
1. I'm not satisfied with the battery, it drains little faster. However, it's perfect for an average use.
2. No option for switching the watch to silent mode
3. During an incoming call there are only two options; attend or reject, can't silent the call and also the ringtone is very annoying.
4. Most of the watch faces have a childish nature
5. Only we can store upto 8 contacts in the watch
6. There is no option to connect to a bluetooth headset from watch
7. Charging takes about 2 hours"
10641,4.0,"I bought this watch at an Discounted prize , so the watch poses the maximum feature that a Smartwatch must have.
Talking about the Quality - Impressive
Rise to wake - Quick
Battery life - Average it consumes around 100 % to 0% in 3-4 Days.
Sports Mode - Enough to make you go totally fitness freak.
Call quality - Above average (not that bad )
SpO2 and Heart Rate Accuracy - ~90%
Music Control - Remarkable.

Deciding Statement - BUY IT , it is Surely a worth buying watch and a nice product by FIRE-BOLTT"
10642,5.0,"Happy with the performance of this Watch. At this much Budget it is worth to spent on Fireboltt watch with smart Bluetooth Calling as well. I have compared it with more other brand watches but finally i selected this as i already have a same brand watch which is without Calling. happy with the Sound quality while talking on watch. However, Battery life with bluetooth calling is not that much satisifed. otherwise it has 4 to 5 days of battery backup.

i would suggest to buy this watch"
10643,4.0,"A lovely compact packaged product. The product catalogue is too small and hardly legible. The watch has some very good features for the price band. The blue tooth calling is a definite plus. The battery definitely needs an improvement, I am still testing the waterproof part. The app which has information needs a lot of work. The plus is it can pass information on to Google fit app. The battery charge takes quite a bit of time as well. Overall the look and feel is great. The functions offered are good for the price."
10644,4.0,"touch is more better than other, accuracy not 100% but 75% to 85% show accurate data. but i suggest to not compare with the accuracy. its value for money, nice look and battery also good."
10645,4.0,Fireboltt should make battery 🪫more stronger & also add the battery percentage on the watch ! You can see only in the app 😓 otherwise everything is great and till now no lagging issue. If your budget matches with the price you should buy that!
10646,4.0,It is a good product at affordable price. There are can a scope of improvement in the software that is in use but the product has aced it in the hardware parts. It looks really classy and the touch response time is also amazing. However it can improve by reducing the charging time as it takes 2 hours to charge from 0 to 100%.
10647,4.0,My review in take 2 watch calling future is mind blowing future and good watch and under price one off the best in take 2 smart watch special in watch stylish very awesome and running and walk measure and good manner in this watch and vioce futer are in this watch very good in this watch my review is very goodAnd touchpad is very nice experience in this watch and battery pick up in 3-4 days are coming and calls are touching battery life bee decrease
10648,4.0,"The smart watch is good but the battery is not upto the mark while connected through Bluetooth the battery gets drained very fast, otherwise the battery life is almost 4-5 days. Calling feature is very good overall the product is good except the battery."
10649,4.0,"Exlent
Using a smartwatch, you can make and receive calls . So there is no need to use your phone, and you can answer call quickly.

This smartwatch is of waterproof, and thus you can keep using the smartwatch free from any worries.

Battery life is good . We need to charge every 2to3 days . So this is a little bit problem ..

The deviation rate of this watch is quite high and sometimes it does not show correct reading ..

Overall this product is 4.5 rated !!!."
10650,4.0,Product is good really like the design and display also calling features is amazing only thing make me confuse my Google fit step counter show 8219 and watch show 6289... Lol
10651,4.0,Overall a nice watch but the glass quality is not upto the mark by mistake watch fell on the ground with a less impact and now it has a tiny crack on the glass which is barely visible. Also should be delivered with temepered glass.
10652,4.0,"I would say it is worth it, overall performance is completely fine, I see some cost cutting there but the watch is okay and working perfectly fine. Thank you. ⭐⭐⭐⭐"
10653,4.0,"I have just received the Product but before applying warranty, user review is mandatory. I will be able to provide my review after 10days of usage."
10654,4.0,Best smartwatch in this price battery life is good and bp steps counts are not accuracy little bit different
10655,4.0,"Received this product yesterday, very easy to use and the touch is very responsive. Calls are also very clear both the caller and the receiver have no issues during the calls. Working just fine."
10656,4.0,"Pros
It is a fantastic watch to buy.
Good sound quality on call
Good display quality

Cons
Only 1 watch face can be downloaded rest all are preset"
10657,4.0,Fire bolt smart watch very stylish and looks was very beautiful total watch is excellent but battery life is not bad please improve in the battery. But watch is very good
10658,4.0,"For the price this is a great smartwatch. Easy to use, with all the features I need on a daily basis. It makes my life easier. Although i do wish for more customisation features, but i also understand budget constraints"
10659,4.0,"The product is excellent & price worthy. It has some latest features like a voice assistant, making and receiving calls directly from our firebolt smartwatch with a built-in mic and speakers."
10660,4.0,"It is one of the best smartwatches so far but only problem is with its ringing, not suitable for classroom because of its loud ringing and cannot be muted also. Still one of the best watch in its price segment."
10661,4.0,"Best round dial watch in this price segment!!
Nice features and a good mic with speaker makes it a perfect watch.....☺"
10662,4.0,Battery life is quite good. Touch is quite good. Overall everything is very accurate as per the descriptions.
10663,4.0,Touch screen response is good but little bit hard to go back main screen while exercising. If connected with phone i.e. Bluetooth calls battery backup is less otherwise it lasts upto 10 days.
10664,4.0,The watch is jst amazing for the price.... Simply awsome... Best watch under 2.2k really luv it
10665,4.0,All good except ring volume control & charging level not show but i advised good product go for it.
10666,4.0,i was confussed between phoenix and talk 2 but chosed this it has a good build quality and feels premium
10667,4.0,"I like it. it's a very cool and superb watch .
Battery is ok and sound quality is also fantastic. But there is a little bit problem in accuracy. So finally
I think in this range firebolt gives to us very good product"
10668,4.0,Wwaaooo Amazing watch in this price range.Built quality is good.Calling facility is very good and clear voice.
10669,4.0,Its an fabulous product and its touch is not good but it is better in this price range and accuracy is not that much good 👍
10670,4.0,"I like this watch so much because future are so good like calling, smoothness is making great to watch."
10671,4.0,A little less features compared to a 3k watch which felt like i would need them. Like a night mode which doesnt wake the watch in my sleep.
10672,4.0,"Amazing economical smart watch with decent graphics .
Just one feedback though, need to enhance the touch screen quality"
10673,4.0,The watch is good. It's bluetooth functions are proper and we can call and talk properly.
10674,4.0,"The touch screen and accuracy is very good

I am not satisfied with the bettery...."
10675,4.0,Battery life is good.... We can read any languages in messages...best smartwatch under this price range
10676,4.0,Very nice watch but battery life reduces if connected to smartphone for a long time.
10677,4.0,The only thing I dislike is that it automatically connects calls too even if I disconnect aftr few min it automatically connects and calls comes on watch rather then phone
10678,4.0,"I like its design , battery life is good and also fitting is also good"
10679,4.0,"Using this since 4 days.Battery life is good so far.To get better battery life Bluetooth has to be used on need basis. Touch is ok .
One feature I look forward is pairing of headset to smartwatch.
Also the watch should be provided with automatic workout detection.

Considering all the above I will give an overall 4* rating.However I will rerate after few days based on the performance.

Up date after approx 15days:
1.We require to charge the watch once in 5 to 6 if we are keeping blutoth off , using it in controlled manner , also reducing the display brightness. As I said earlier we need to use Bluetooth on need basis .
2. Remote operation of camera is having a lag.Yet times it is very quick in responding , sometimes it is slow.
3. Delayed touch observed in case of remote camera operation.
4.Steps count and km measurement is accurate.But calorie count is inaccurate as the formula considered to derive the figure is inaccurate.Request to check web for accurate formula.This is applicable for all smart watches , the same is observed in two different makes a aila le with me."
10680,4.0,it is a very good product and i think that you should also give screen guard for some money in combo like of 100 or 150 because some time it is hard to get on store
10681,4.0,I like this product. Calling and speaker quality are awesome.
10682,4.0,I'm also one of your type hunting for reviews for proper purchase. I was searching for a smart watch with calling function. The best part which I liked in this smart watch is the calling function which we can make and receive call directly from the smartwatch. We can also dial from the smartwatch. The only part which is annoying is the screen wake up on lifting the watch. This consumes more battery life. Rest everything's good.

Bluetooth calling is flawless."
10686,4.0,I liked the performance of watch.. the overall features is really nice and good
10687,4.0,The watch is really good for its price. The built quality is quite premium and the straps quality is also impressive. The promt phone notification on the watch is amazing.it shows WhatsApp and Instagram messages also we can control musice through watch. But there are littlebit issue with the accuracy of steps count otherwise all other sensors works well. Overall it looks pretty on the wrist.
10688,4.0,"This is a premium smartwatch under this budget. I like it's build quality, colour, working battery life."
10689,4.0,"Touch is of good quality, all good features like spo2, steps, pulse check, calling feature is awesome"
10690,4.0,"Overall it's a budget friendly smartwatch
Pros :
1. Stylish design and comfortable to wear
2. Touchscreen is working well and it gives a faster response too
3. Menu and other options are arranged well
4. Heart rate, spO2 are almost accurate
5. The clarity of mike and speaker are very well
6. The two buttons help to switch into different modes easily.
7. Instant notification from applications
8. There are plenty of watch faces

Cons :
1. I'm not satisfied with the battery, it drains little faster. However, it's perfect for an average use.
2. No option for switching the watch to silent mode
3. During an incoming call there are only two options; attend or reject, can't silent the call and also the ringtone is very annoying.
4. Most of the watch faces have a childish nature
5. Only we can store upto 8 contacts in the watch
6. There is no option to connect to a bluetooth headset from watch
7. Charging takes about 2 hours"
10691,4.0,"I bought this watch at an Discounted prize , so the watch poses the maximum feature that a Smartwatch must have.
Talking about the Quality - Impressive
Rise to wake - Quick
Battery life - Average it consumes around 100 % to 0% in 3-4 Days.
Sports Mode - Enough to make you go totally fitness freak.
Call quality - Above average (not that bad )
SpO2 and Heart Rate Accuracy - ~90%
Music Control - Remarkable.

Deciding Statement - BUY IT , it is Surely a worth buying watch and a nice product by FIRE-BOLTT"
10692,4.0,"Happy with the performance of this Watch. At this much Budget it is worth to spent on Fireboltt watch with smart Bluetooth Calling as well. I have compared it with more other brand watches but finally i selected this as i already have a same brand watch which is without Calling. happy with the Sound quality while talking on watch. However, Battery life with bluetooth calling is not that much satisifed. otherwise it has 4 to 5 days of battery backup.

i would suggest to buy this watch"
10693,4.0,"A lovely compact packaged product. The product catalogue is too small and hardly legible. The watch has some very good features for the price band. The blue tooth calling is a definite plus. The battery definitely needs an improvement, I am still testing the waterproof part. The app which has information needs a lot of work. The plus is it can pass information on to Google fit app. The battery charge takes quite a bit of time as well. Overall the look and feel is great. The functions offered are good for the price."
10694,4.0,"touch is more better than other, accuracy not 100% but 75% to 85% show accurate data. but i suggest to not compare with the accuracy. its value for money, nice look and battery also good."
10695,4.0,Fireboltt should make battery 🪫more stronger & also add the battery percentage on the watch ! You can see only in the app 😓 otherwise everything is great and till now no lagging issue. If your budget matches with the price you should buy that!
10696,4.0,It is a good product at affordable price. There are can a scope of improvement in the software that is in use but the product has aced it in the hardware parts. It looks really classy and the touch response time is also amazing. However it can improve by reducing the charging time as it takes 2 hours to charge from 0 to 100%.
10697,4.0,My review in take 2 watch calling future is mind blowing future and good watch and under price one off the best in take 2 smart watch special in watch stylish very awesome and running and walk measure and good manner in this watch and vioce futer are in this watch very good in this watch my review is very goodAnd touchpad is very nice experience in this watch and battery pick up in 3-4 days are coming and calls are touching battery life bee decrease
10698,4.0,"The smart watch is good but the battery is not upto the mark while connected through Bluetooth the battery gets drained very fast, otherwise the battery life is almost 4-5 days. Calling feature is very good overall the product is good except the battery."
10699,4.0,"Exlent
Using a smartwatch, you can make and receive calls . So there is no need to use your phone, and you can answer call quickly.

This smartwatch is of waterproof, and thus you can keep using the smartwatch free from any worries.

Battery life is good . We need to charge every 2to3 days . So this is a little bit problem ..

The deviation rate of this watch is quite high and sometimes it does not show correct reading ..

Overall this product is 4.5 rated !!!."
10700,4.0,Product is good really like the design and display also calling features is amazing only thing make me confuse my Google fit step counter show 8219 and watch show 6289... Lol
10701,4.0,Overall a nice watch but the glass quality is not upto the mark by mistake watch fell on the ground with a less impact and now it has a tiny crack on the glass which is barely visible. Also should be delivered with temepered glass.
10702,4.0,"I would say it is worth it, overall performance is completely fine, I see some cost cutting there but the watch is okay and working perfectly fine. Thank you. ⭐⭐⭐⭐"
10703,4.0,"I have just received the Product but before applying warranty, user review is mandatory. I will be able to provide my review after 10days of usage."
10704,4.0,Best smartwatch in this price battery life is good and bp steps counts are not accuracy little bit different
10705,4.0,"Received this product yesterday, very easy to use and the touch is very responsive. Calls are also very clear both the caller and the receiver have no issues during the calls. Working just fine."
10706,4.0,"Pros
It is a fantastic watch to buy.
Good sound quality on call
Good display quality

Cons
Only 1 watch face can be downloaded rest all are preset"
10707,4.0,Fire bolt smart watch very stylish and looks was very beautiful total watch is excellent but battery life is not bad please improve in the battery. But watch is very good
10708,4.0,"For the price this is a great smartwatch. Easy to use, with all the features I need on a daily basis. It makes my life easier. Although i do wish for more customisation features, but i also understand budget constraints"
10709,4.0,"The product is excellent & price worthy. It has some latest features like a voice assistant, making and receiving calls directly from our firebolt smartwatch with a built-in mic and speakers."
10710,4.0,"It is one of the best smartwatches so far but only problem is with its ringing, not suitable for classroom because of its loud ringing and cannot be muted also. Still one of the best watch in its price segment."
10711,4.0,"Best round dial watch in this price segment!!
Nice features and a good mic with speaker makes it a perfect watch.....☺"
10712,4.0,Battery life is quite good. Touch is quite good. Overall everything is very accurate as per the descriptions.
10713,4.0,Touch screen response is good but little bit hard to go back main screen while exercising. If connected with phone i.e. Bluetooth calls battery backup is less otherwise it lasts upto 10 days.
10714,4.0,The watch is jst amazing for the price.... Simply awsome... Best watch under 2.2k really luv it
10715,4.0,All good except ring volume control & charging level not show but i advised good product go for it.
10716,4.0,i was confussed between phoenix and talk 2 but chosed this it has a good build quality and feels premium
10717,4.0,"I like it. it's a very cool and superb watch .
Battery is ok and sound quality is also fantastic. But there is a little bit problem in accuracy. So finally
I think in this range firebolt gives to us very good product"
10718,4.0,Wwaaooo Amazing watch in this price range.Built quality is good.Calling facility is very good and clear voice.
10719,4.0,Its an fabulous product and its touch is not good but it is better in this price range and accuracy is not that much good 👍
10720,4.0,"I like this watch so much because future are so good like calling, smoothness is making great to watch."
10721,4.0,A little less features compared to a 3k watch which felt like i would need them. Like a night mode which doesnt wake the watch in my sleep.
10722,4.0,"Amazing economical smart watch with decent graphics .
Just one feedback though, need to enhance the touch screen quality"
10723,4.0,The watch is good. It's bluetooth functions are proper and we can call and talk properly.
10724,4.0,"The touch screen and accuracy is very good

I am not satisfied with the bettery...."
10725,4.0,Battery life is good.... We can read any languages in messages...best smartwatch under this price range
10726,4.0,Very nice watch but battery life reduces if connected to smartphone for a long time.
10727,4.0,The only thing I dislike is that it automatically connects calls too even if I disconnect aftr few min it automatically connects and calls comes on watch rather then phone
10728,4.0,"I like its design , battery life is good and also fitting is also good"
10729,4.0,"Using this since 4 days.Battery life is good so far.To get better battery life Bluetooth has to be used on need basis. Touch is ok .
One feature I look forward is pairing of headset to smartwatch.
Also the watch should be provided with automatic workout detection.

Considering all the above I will give an overall 4* rating.However I will rerate after few days based on the performance.

Up date after approx 15days:
1.We require to charge the watch once in 5 to 6 if we are keeping blutoth off , using it in controlled manner , also reducing the display brightness. As I said earlier we need to use Bluetooth on need basis .
2. Remote operation of camera is having a lag.Yet times it is very quick in responding , sometimes it is slow.
3. Delayed touch observed in case of remote camera operation.
4.Steps count and km measurement is accurate.But calorie count is inaccurate as the formula considered to derive the figure is inaccurate.Request to check web for accurate formula.This is applicable for all smart watches , the same is observed in two different makes a aila le with me."
10730,4.0,it is a very good product and i think that you should also give screen guard for some money in combo like of 100 or 150 because some time it is hard to get on store
10731,4.0,I like this product. Calling and speaker quality are awesome.
10732,4.0,I'm also one of your type hunting for reviews for proper purchase. I was searching for a smart watch with calling function. The best part which I liked in this smart watch is the calling function which we can make and receive call directly from the smartwatch. We can also dial from the smartwatch. The only part which is annoying is the screen wake up on lifting the watch. This consumes more battery life. Rest everything's good.
10733,4.0,I liked the quality of product and hopefully the better life should be good
10734,4.0,The best watch i ever get look awesome working best i took three watch love it
10735,4.0,"Good and solid built. Inner display is little bit off position to top side part. Bright display, Raise to wake works perfectly.

10739,4.0,"Touch is of good quality, all good features like spo2, steps, pulse check, calling feature is awesome"
10740,4.0,"The watch is extremely affordable as it just cost me Rs. 1999. The watch's strap is of a pretty good quality and makes you feel comfortable when worn. The watch's capsule is made up of pure stainless steel. Whenever someone looks at the watch, they aren't able to tell that it only cost me 2K bucks, as the display of the watch, gives an expensive vibe. But, the screen of the watch hasn't covered the whole glass (as shown on the cover of the box of the watch). Pixels of the watch could have been improved & they could have added one or two more games too! Spo2, Heart Rate, steps, weather & sleep tracker are quite accurate, would have rated it a 5/5 if they wouldn't have had done fake marketing of the product. But, if you have a budget of 2000 in your mind, then this watch has been designed for you, my friend!"

10743,4.0,"First thing is that for the price it's a ""fairly good watch"" i would give it an easy 3.8⭐.
The problem's that I faced using this watch is that the battery of this watch is not really that great, you get a maximum of 3 days and a few hours of battery life. Mind you that I have disabled everything, including the vibration, phone and the brightness reduced to nearly 10%. So if you want a better battery, don't take this. And second is that since this one has a call feature, it has a really annoying and very loud tune that rings when someone calls you and there is no option of muting that ring or any sorts. The rest, like I said 3.8⭐"

10754,4.0,"I like the quality of watch is very good. And accuracy of sleep, touch screen, and all good. Price is also affordable."
10755,4.0,Just received the product today. At first glance looks good and promising.But yet to explore all of its features. I will update the review after few weeks of use.
10756,4.0,"Writing this review after gifting if to my brother and using for 1 hour. Watch touch screen is awesome, no lag and smooth running. Charging is quite fast. 20 minutes and 20-60% charge. Watch is good looking too. I haven't test the sleep tracking yet. But my bro will surely tell the sleep tracking experience and I'll edit this review. The only bad (actually worst) thing about this watch is that the sensors are fully fake. I tested it on a table and it shows that the table has 78 bpm. If you wear it you will also get the same result. Watch is quite good, you could go for it if you are not looking for a heart beat, SpO2 sensing watch because they are worst."
10757,5.0," I am writing this detailed review after using this product for a week:

Build Quality: It is metal body but not the pure metal material, overall build quality is good.

Screen: Amazing experience with screen, even it is not Amoled display but you will not feel the need as brightness is sufficient when wants to use in Sunlight. Touch is very smooth but you will get scratches on screen easily. Wakeup function was not working initially but worked pretty well after resetting.

Accuracy: Most of the Smartwatches measure ghost reading so this does but overall accuracy is good in this budget.

Battery: The average battery back up is 6-7days, the battery backup will be 2-3 days if you are using calling function moderately. It takes 1.5 hour to full charge"
10758,4.0,"The overall product is good and very well designed there is every features which is important there is no issue related to its feature and the design of the product was just amazing,slim and very good looking .I faced the issue with it's side button there is not a quick response the button work slow compare to other watch brands"
10759,4.0,"The product is good. Only the calling ringtone is not that good. When the incoming call is ringing voice of the ringtone is so high. I tried to silent that but volume doesn't changed. There should be a facility to make it silent or lower the volume.
I will rate this product as 4 star 🌟🌟🌟🌟"
10760,4.0, Touch is smooth.. belt is soft so it's very comfortable while wearing it for a long time... Affordable Smart Watch in this range with such good features.. calling option is available so one can call using the dail and also pick up the call the voice will come from the watch it self as it has speaker and a mic.. you can sync the contacts also various notification options are available. Overall a great product in this price range.. Quality is superb..
10761,4.0,"Durable and nice watch value for money .
Very satisfied with the performance of the product with long lasting battery ."
10762,4.0,"The watch is value for money. The touchscreen is super responsive and accuracy is good.
Did not expect much from battery life but it did surprise me. I got very good battery life with moderate usage. The call clarity is also very good. Overall very satisfactory experience. The only negative thing i found was the ringtone of the watch which cant be silenced. It is very loud and can irritate you after a while."

10766,4.0,"I will recommend that buy the watch in sale when the price drop to ₹1899.
Rest the review is below. (I hope it helps).

Pros.....
1) Look is premium. (10/10)
2) Smooth experience. (9/10)
3) Battery backup is also decent. (8/10)
4) Raise to wake is a responsive (8/10)
5) Sleep tracking is decent. (8/10)

Cons...
6) There are a lot of watch faces in dafit app but half of it is boaring (6/10)

7) Do not have option to silent the calls and also the volume of ringtone can't be decreased (feature is available but do not work). (1/10)

8) The biggest problem that I have faced is that the watch is automatically connected to other device if they have dafit.(My watch was connected to random phones two time) and then they can easily change everything on your watch. In other smartwatch first we have to reset the watch to connect to other device 😑😑.

9) Only vibration for alarm, no sound even after having good speaker. (2/10)

10793,3.0,"First thing is that for the price it's a ""fairly good watch"" i would give it an easy 3.8⭐.
The problem's that I faced using this watch is that the battery of this watch is not really that great, you get a maximum of 3 days and a few hours of battery life. Mind you that I have disabled everything, including the vibration, phone and the brightness reduced to nearly 10%. So if you want a better battery, don't take this. And second is that since this one has a call feature, it has a really annoying and very loud tune that rings when someone calls you and there is no option of muting that ring or any sorts. The rest, like I said 3.8⭐"

10795,3.0,It is overall a good product. The calling quality and speaker quality is good in this budget. It goes 2 days in one go after charging. Slight issue with the button and the screen doesn't lit up when I turn my wrist. Overall it's a good product.
10796,5.0,The watch looks very good and is very easy to operate. The body of the frame is metallic which makes the watch a bit heavy but the quality is very nice. There are few coupons also available in the box which you can redeem and get exciting offers.

10799,4.0,"Well.. I guess u should hope for much at this price point, but still it's good enough for giving u an idea about the actual data.. Like it's not 100% accurate but yeah.. It's okeish.. ✌"
10800,4.0,"This bolt watch is a reasonable product for a daily use. And for phisical fitness, I can give a 4 out of 5 rating ."
10801,3.0,"This watch is amazing and worth it.
It is very economical and in budget watch having numerous features.Need to improve in battery backup thing.
Overall experience is good."
10802,3.0,"The watch looks amazing, metal body gives it a sturdy look and solid feel. the touch interface is very smooth as compared to other watches in same category and it comes with variety of different features"
10803,4.0,At price under 2k... Metal body... Bluetooth calling and most of the smart watch features... The round dial is just a class design...screen quality is good... Best for everyday use
10804,4.0,"I like the quality of watch is very good. And accuracy of sleep, touch screen, and all good. Price is also affordable."
10805,4.0,Just received the product today. At first glance looks good and promising.But yet to explore all of its features. I will update the review after few weeks of use.
10806,4.0,"Writing this review after gifting if to my brother and using for 1 hour. Watch touch screen is awesome, no lag and smooth running. Charging is quite fast. 20 minutes and 20-60% charge. Watch is good looking too. I haven't test the sleep tracking yet. But my bro will surely tell the sleep tracking experience and I'll edit this review. The only bad (actually worst) thing about this watch is that the sensors are fully fake. I tested it on a table and it shows that the table has 78 bpm. If you wear it you will also get the same result. Watch is quite good, you could go for it if you are not looking for a heart beat, SpO2 sensing watch because they are worst."
10807,5.0," I am writing this detailed review after using this product for a week:

Build Quality: It is metal body but not the pure metal material, overall build quality is good.

Screen: Amazing experience with screen, even it is not Amoled display but you will not feel the need as brightness is sufficient when wants to use in Sunlight. Touch is very smooth but you will get scratches on screen easily. Wakeup function was not working initially but worked pretty well after resetting.

Accuracy: Most of the Smartwatches measure ghost reading so this does but overall accuracy is good in this budget.

Battery: The average battery back up is 6-7days, the battery backup will be 2-3 days if you are using calling function moderately. It takes 1.5 hour to full charge"
10808,4.0,"The overall product is good and very well designed there is every features which is important there is no issue related to its feature and the design of the product was just amazing,slim and very good looking .I faced the issue with it's side button there is not a quick response the button work slow compare to other watch brands"
10809,4.0,"The product is good. Only the calling ringtone is not that good. When the incoming call is ringing voice of the ringtone is so high. I tried to silent that but volume doesn't changed. There should be a facility to make it silent or lower the volume.
I will rate this product as 4 star 🌟🌟🌟🌟"
10810,4.0, Touch is smooth.. belt is soft so it's very comfortable while wearing it for a long time... Affordable Smart Watch in this range with such good features.. calling option is available so one can call using the dail and also pick up the call the voice will come from the watch it self as it has speaker and a mic.. you can sync the contacts also various notification options are available. Overall a great product in this price range.. Quality is superb..
10811,4.0,"Durable and nice watch value for money .
Very satisfied with the performance of the product with long lasting battery ."
10812,4.0,"The watch is value for money. The touchscreen is super responsive and accuracy is good.
Did not expect much from battery life but it did surprise me. I got very good battery life with moderate usage. The call clarity is also very good. Overall very satisfactory experience. The only negative thing i found was the ringtone of the watch which cant be silenced. It is very loud and can irritate you after a while."
10813,4.0,After 3month i am seeing a line in centre. It's ok product to see just time. Silicone belt is itchy not good quality.
10814,4.0,The watch is value for money. The touchscreen is super responsive and accuracy is good. Did not expect much from battery life but it did surprise me. I got very good battery life with moderate usage. The call clarity is also very good
10815,4.0,"I loved the battery life of this watch, it connects very efficiently with the app and tracking is quite efficient"
10816,4.0,"I will recommend that buy the watch in sale when the price drop to ₹1899.
Rest the review is below. (I hope it helps).

Pros.....
1) Look is premium. (10/10)
2) Smooth experience. (9/10)
3) Battery backup is also decent. (8/10)
4) Raise to wake is a responsive (8/10)
5) Sleep tracking is decent. (8/10)

Cons...
6) There are a lot of watch faces in dafit app but half of it is boaring (6/10)

7) Do not have option to silent the calls and also the volume of ringtone can't be decreased (feature is available but do not work). (1/10)

8) The biggest problem that I have faced is that the watch is automatically connected to other device if they have dafit.(My watch was connected to random phones two time) and then they can easily change everything on your watch. In other smartwatch first we have to reset the watch to connect to other device 😑😑.

9) Only vibration for alarm, no sound even after having good speaker. (2/10)

The watch's capsule is made up of pure stainless steel. Whenever someone looks at the watch, they aren't able to tell that it only cost me 2K bucks, as the display of the watch, gives an expensive vibe. But, the screen of the watch hasn't covered the whole glass (as shown on the cover of the box of the watch). Pixels of the watch could have been improved & they could have added one or two more games too! Spo2, Heart Rate, steps, weather & sleep tracker are quite accurate, would have rated it a 5/5 if they wouldn't have had done fake marketing of the product. But, if you have a budget of 2000 in your mind, then this watch has been designed for you, my friend!"

Accuracy: Most of the Smartwatches measure ghost reading so this does but overall accuracy is good in this budget.

10984,4.0,"The watch is extremely affordable as it just cost me Rs. 1999. The watch's strap is of a pretty good quality and makes you feel comfortable when worn. The watch's capsule is made up of pure stainless steel. Whenever someone looks at the watch, they aren't able to tell that it only cost me 2K bucks, as the display of the watch, gives an expensive vibe. But, the screen of the watch hasn't covered the whole glass (as shown on the cover of the box of the watch). Pixels of the watch could have been improved & they could have added one or two more games too! Spo2, Heart Rate, steps, weather & sleep tracker are quite accurate, would have rated it a 5/5 if they wouldn't have had done fake marketing of the product. But, if you have a budget of 2000 in your mind, then this watch has been designed for you, my friend!"

10987,4.0,"First thing is that for the price it's a ""fairly good watch"" i would give it an easy 3.8⭐.
The problem's that I faced using this watch is that the battery of this watch is not really that great, you get a maximum of 3 days and a few hours of battery life. Mind you that I have disabled everything, including the vibration, phone and the brightness reduced to nearly 10%. So if you want a better battery, don't take this. And second is that since this one has a call feature, it has a really annoying and very loud tune that rings when someone calls you and there is no option of muting that ring or any sorts. The rest, like I said 3.8⭐"

It's a good buy and helps me communicate on emergency calls in traffic and the voice through the watch is good for me..
Calling and Receiving calls good.
Notifications vibrate the watch need to click the side button to view it.
Silenting the calls, stops ring in watch but you have to reach for the phone to mute it there.
Sleep tracking gives good results, i can track the good sleep i have been through.

11134,4.0," Used this watch for over a month now.. Bought it during the first sale.. Keep reading for an unbiased review and tips/tricks to ensure all the functions in the watch are working smoothly.
1) Large Curved Display in this price category - 1.69 inch
2) Battery with heavy usage and frequently waking up the screen, alexa, alarms, notifications is about 3 days. On standby while just checking the time occassionally is about 8 days. Pretty good. Full charging time is about 1.5 hours. Decent quality magnetic charging cable provided. Use your own low power adapter, power bank or laptop.
3) Has all the necessary health / workout tracking options.. Spo2( Oxymeter), Heart Rate monitor..Accuracy is 95-98%. Sleep tracking is pretty accurate too. Paedometer is accurate most of the times, but sometimes few hundred steps are added randomly without any activity. This happens randomly once in 3-4 days. Stress Monitor is also there but not sure how it's calculated. The sensors aren not fake most probably because if the watch isn't in contact with your skin it will display a warning message and won't display data.
4) Lift to wake up gesture works but with a 1 second delay.. which is manageable. It has Tap to wake functionality too.
5) Works with most popular notifications: Whatsapp, SMS, Facebook, Instagram etc. Can read the entire SMS on watch and most of the other messages unless it's very long.
6) Calls can't be picked up or silenced.. You can only see the caller id and reject the call.
7) BT Music Control, Weather ☁️ update and Alexa are other usable smart features.
8) 50 different watch face are available on the Boat wave app. Some are really good.. You can also have customised wallpapers as watch faces . See the posted pictures.
9) The Boat Wave app is neatly organized and syncs health data without any issues instantly. The app also has assisted GPS functionality which can track your running activities on a map, in case you need that data.
10) The User Interface is smooth.. Please note that it's not laggy. The animations and transitions are a little slow but overall easy to use. Touch screen response is excellent and feels nice.
11) Overall construction is sturdy and feels nice and comfortable to wear it. It has water resistance of 5 ATM.. Can take it for a short duration swim in a pool, under the shower or rain without any worries. Watch uppper body is brushed aluminium and under body is good quality plastic. The straps are soft and also of very good quality. It doesn't irritate your skin even after wearing it for long durations. Four colour options are available with equally matching straps.. Straps can be easily replaced with fancy straps.
12 ) Works both with Android and iPhone flawlessly. Tested on both.

TIPs AND TRICKs ________________________________________

1) Boat wave app needs to run in the background all the time for your call notifications, message notifications, Alexa functionality and Weather updates. If you accidentally clear all the cache and background apps from the phone, the watch will disconnect from the phone after some time when idle ( no active inputs probably after 10-15 mins). Keep the boat wave app running in the background. Most people complaining that the watch frequently disconnected might unintentionally be clearing all the background apps. My watch was continuously connected for 4 straight days without me having to reconnect as long as the boat wave app was running in the background.

2) Alexa on this watch can do a lot of things..It can set your alarms, start the stopwatch, show weather, control Alexa based devices like Echo, wireless lights and AC, work as a simple calculator, translate simple/ short English sentences to German, Spanish, Italian, French and Portugese, get you common stock quotes from internet, can you snippets of general information from the internet in case you don't know something. Yes, Alexa on your watch getting you the information is a little slow, takes about 30 -40 seconds to process your request but it's convenient and better that taking out the phone from your pocket which might take similar amount of time or longer. In my personal experience, Alexa works a little faster on Android as compared to iphone ( maybe 2-3 second difference). Also if there is break while speaking or if there is a long sentence, then it's difficult for Alexa to understand.. Check my video.. Keep it short and you should get the results accurately
3) For Alexa to work properly: After connecting the Boat Wave app with an Amazon account, download the Alexa app and check your Xtend watch is visible under Devices option.
4) To pickup and make calls handsfree without using the phone, just use a Bluetooth headset with voice assistant function. It will work as a charm. The speaker function on most smart watches is useless as it's not convenient for calls while traveling or in a crowded place due to low volume and obviously you don't want everyone to hear your private conversation.. With voice assistant feature on your BT headset you can make a call or play music without having to touch your phone.

Few other functions which could have been provided and is missing. Actually available in many similarly priced devices :
1) Torch 🔦 - Makes the display bright white.. Comes handy in darkness.
2) Remote shutter button for camera.
3) Call silencing option could have been added."

Design, Build & Comfort
When buying a smartwatch, one always thinks about its design and look. Apart from features, design and build is another major aspect one should take care of when buying a smartwatch. The boat has worked on its design this time which brings it to a premium side in terms of look. The design is inspired by the Apple Watch 3, but it cannot be compared to that. Obviously, in every aspect, Apple Watch 3 would be much better than the Boat Xtend Smartwatch. Redmi Watch as well as Amazfit Bip U Pro has the same shape and design, but the build quality is much premium on this one.

Boat Xtend design and build
I personally don’t like the color scheme of this Boat Xtend Smartwatch. The black color variant comes with a golden color metallic frame. I believe the gold color would fade away after some time. There are three other color variants, which also don’t look stylish as this one. However, that is my personal opinion on the color scheme, so maybe you might find the color scheme to be good.

Boat Xtend design
The watch has 5ATM water resistance. It has silicon straps, which are quite comfortable. The straps are good quality straps which you will find comfortable with regular usage.

Display
Coming to the display, the watch has a 42mm square shape display. What you see on this one is a TFT panel. The screen has big bezels, however, the good part is that the screen goes completely back when it is off, so you won’t notice the bezels, and the screen quality won’t feel cheap at all. It doesn’t have an always-on display, but we cannot complain about that. The watch offers a screen on time of up to 20 seconds and up to 12 levels of brightness control.

Boat Xtend display quality
I find the display quality of the Boat Xtend Smartwatch to be better than the previous smartwatch from Boat. View angle is good on this one, and you can clearly see content on this smartwatch even in the sunlight. The color on this one is not very saturated, but this isn’t something that we can complain about in this price range.

Watch UI And Features
The UI of this smartwatch is clean and easy to use. There is a single button on the watch which works as the power/off button as well as the back button. Moreover, the display is a touchscreen display that works without any problem. There isn’t much animation on the bar menu, and the navigation is simple, so you won’t find it difficult to use. However, the watch may lag a bit. The company has done cost-cutting in terms of the processor, that’s why you may find it to lag a bit, but it is OK, and not a big deal at the price point you get it.

Boat Xtend Ui
The watch offers all the basic fitness features such as daily activity (which includes total steps walked, calories burnt, and time), heart rate, sleep tracking, stress tracking breath training, SpO2 training, meditation, find my phone, and music control. Apart from that, there are 14 different support modes on this watch. I tried a few of them, and they worked fine. The watch notifies you of the incoming calls, messages received, and various other notifications in detail.

Boat Xtend smartwatch review
Alexa Support
The main highlight of the Boat Xtend is the Amazon Alexa Support. The watch has an in-built microphone, and you can access it by long-pressing the back button. Do note that you can only do some basic tasks with Alexa on the watch like setting an alarm, setting a timer, and such. Well, it is a good thing to have Alexa on a watch, but you won’t find it very useful. Probably you will use it for a day or two out of excitement, and then you won’t prefer using it because it only does some basic tasks. So, even if Boat missed this feature, it won’t be a problem.

Boat Xtend Alexa support
Watch Faces
The next cool thing about this Boat Smartwatch is the watch faces you get on this one. You get more than 100 watch faces on the watch, and probably more watch faces will be added to it. Moreover, you can also set a custom watch face as well.

Boat Xtend watch faces
Boat Wave App
You will have to download the Boat Wave App to use the watch. The app is available for both Android as well as iOS devices. You won’t be seeing bugs on the app, and it works perfectly. I haven’t noticed any problem with connectivity like frequent disconnection. The interface of the Boat Wave is clean and simple. You will get all the fitness-related options and all the watch settings on the app itself.

Accuracy
Accuracy is one of the important aspects that one should take care of when buying a smartwatch. So talking about the accuracy, I tested everything on this watch, from normal walking to running, sleeping, and much more, and I find the results to be accurate.

Boat Xtend accuracy test
Compared to Realme or Redmi Watch, the result was the same on all of them. So, there is no problem with the accuracy. I don’t find the results to be accurate on most of the budget fitness trackers, but yes, this smartwatch is accurate in terms of fitness tracking, sleep tracking, and everything it does.

Boat Xtend accuracy
Comparing it to the Noise watch which we tried recently, the stress level as well as the SpO2 tracking is much more accurate on this one. It also has the option to track the menstrual cycle in women.

Boat Xtend accuracy
Battery
You get to see a 300mAH battery on this one, which the company claims to last 7 days. However, if you use most of the features of the watch, then the battery will last about two and a half days. If you keep the brightness low, then the battery will last about 3-4 days. I find the battery life to be a downside of the watch. It comes with magnet hook charging support.

Final Words
Boat Xtend Smartwatch is a decent smartwatch from the Boat. It offers all the basic fitness features you will find on a budget fitness tracker, a good display, Alexa support, good design and build, and much more. The smartwatch at this price is quite good. Personally, what I didn’t like about this smartwatch is its color scheme. However, if you like the color scheme, then I would recommend you to go for it. Overall the watch is good with nothing to dislike about it except for the battery life. The battery life on this one is quite low. The company claims it to have a battery life of 7 days, but with regular usage, it will last for 2-3 days. If you are looking for a good smartwatch under Rs.5000, and you can adjust with the battery life, and you like the color scheme, then I would recommend you to go for this smartwatch. It offers all the features that should be there in a smartwatch under Rs.5000."
11136,4.0,"Pros:

1. Premium build quality with matte finishing- sturdy polycarbonate frame, good soft silicone straps that r absolutely flush with the body of the watch. Attractive, trendy colours.
2. Heart Rate (except heart rate spikes in weight training), Pedometer(steps counter) are accurate but SPO2 is off by +/- 2% when compared to Pulse Oximeter readings. But most smart watches offer the same accuracy. Sleep tracking is accurate only for bed time & wake up time, duration but stages of sleep are inaccurate. Light, deep sleep, waking detected but no REM sleep detected. Sleep data from the watch synchronises smoothly with Boat Wave app. Issues warning msg if watch not worn on hand properly and does not detect data of surfaces.
3. Large (1.69""), clear bright, sharp LCD IPS display even in the sun.
4. Touch not smooth, experienced jitters. UI also lags at times & after attaching the tempered glass sometimes some functions require 02-03 taps to work. But acceptable scrolling response if finger moved diagonally instead of vertically.
5. In app GPS works superbly. Excellent route tracking on the map. This feature is not advertised in their description.
6. Bluetooth 5.0 connectivity is good if mobile is kept in close proximity(7m). The Boat Wave app must remain running in the background at all times.
7. Definitely splash proof though did'nt take the risk of submerging the watch.
8. All notifications are working, no problem with call alerts or SMS msgs or social media app notifications. No lags at all though there is provision for a 3 sec lag which can be turned on.
9. Alexa works superbly but since there is no speaker, info is displayed on the screen. My Wipro Smart Bulb, FireTV stick can be controlled easily using the inbuilt Alexa on the watch. Alexa can do mathematical calculations, currency conversions, even foreign language translations, apart from supplying info on anything under the sun. But ofcourse, Alexa cannot make calls. Alexa can set alarm, timer also.
10. Sedentary alert, drinking water reminder, stress alert, menstrual cycle alert, alarms, timers function well.
11. Boat Wave app connects easily & no lags observed. Data syncs smoothly with Google Fit app. Excellent health reports and motivational rewards system in the form of badges. But settings can be changed only through the app and the watch needs to be restarted for the new settings to be effective.
12. Training, Sports modes r good.
13. Guided Breathing mode is also good.
14. Find my phone works well.
15. Extremely stylish, light weight & comfortable for all day wear.
16. 07 watch faces available in the device with 04 preset which cannot be deleted. The rest can be changed from the Boat Wave app.

Cons:

1. Lacks vibration intensity control.
2. Lacks Camera control shutter. But can't figure out its use as my handset accepts both voice commands & gestures to click pics.
3. No quick reply messages for notifications/call alerts.
4. No call acceptance or silencing feature. A work around can be if bluetooth handset is connected at the same time.
5. SPO2 is not accurate and sometimes freezes at 97%. But this is common in all smart watches.
6. Battery does'nt last more than 03 days if continuous HR measurement is turned on. Otherwise easily lasts for 7 days.
7. Watch faces are very childish. Expected better quality designs. Company can easily improve on this in their next update.
8. Amazon Prime only replacement, no refund policy is not good. At least colour change should be allowed once.
9. Music control feature does not display the title of the song.
10. No BP monitoring or temperature monitoring feature. Smart watches usually do not provide reliable BP data.
11. No calling feature. But it does'nt matter as most don't want conversations to be public.
12. A bit large for narrow wrists, band @22 mm is a bit wide.
13. Company should provide a tempered glass protector. No mention of protective glass on the display mentioned. Have attached a Scot tempered glass purchased separately.
14. There are actually only 10 sports modes. Boat has bloated the list with Indoor-Outdoor combi of 4 sports (Walking, Running, Swimming, Cycling).
15. There is no light sensor. Auto brightness is only time dependant but works well.

Was a wedding anniversary gift for my wife who liked it very much even the colour- the evergreen, classic gold-black. Overall the best smart watch with Alexa built in, available at the budget price point of under Rs 3000. An excellent Fitness Tracker but average Health Monitor."
11137,4.0,"First I want to tell.
1.The watch want to update first either it will not work, so it reqest to seller to check the product before selling.

2. The product is very good and satisfied according to price.

3. I will suggest to purchase it. Coz all is better.

4. But seller should check the product before selling to customers.

5. Coz I had return it first then after I recived it, it better coz the device is not updated.

Thank you"
11138,4.0,"I am using this watch from past 2 months it is really amazing. But it got disconnected from my phone automatically and it's hard to reconnect again
Boat wave app doesn't work properly some times it really difficult to use it because it lagg alot

Watch is pretty cool and i love it's design if you are searching for a A Normal smart watch in this price you can go for this."
11139,3.0,"A decent product at this price point[I got it for 1750]

Wanted to try out a generic smartwatch to check how it suits.
Watch faces are decent.

Tracking wise : Sleep tracking is good . Walk tracking is okay

At times i felt uncomfortable wearing the watch. So i switch hands [personal problem probably]"
11140,4.0,"Touch is a little bit poor quality, tracking is good but only sends the exercise data to fit not the other vitals. strap quality is good and battery life is approx a week. writing this review after one month of usage."

11142,4.0,"It has good features, my cousin and my friend purchased same after seeing mine."
11143,3.0,Hi
11144,4.0,The strap quality is not that good recently I went near a door and I opened it and after 1 sec my watch fell down I didnt know it POOR QUALITY OF STRAPS
11145,4.0,"While it seems very appealing but pl mind that functions are very limited and practically you can't use many. Also there's no voice calling or Alexa voice support though you can give give voice command. Limited use, not very great product i will say."
11146,3.0,Before buying this product look the video in Youtube as in this Xtend there is no calling function available. Overall product is good but and however the application which used to connect Xtend is BoatWave is also large in size.
11147,4.0,Value for money
11148,4.0,"I've been using this for 45 days or so and overall it's very good purchase for me..The sleep tracker is accurate, the heart rate is accurate,stress level monitor works well, the oxygen level travels around 96 to 98 in my case and I'm not quite sure whether it's accurate or not..Keeping this aside there are several things..You are provided with 150+ watch faces however you can install 2 watch faces from the app at a time in the watch and 1 customised watch face in which you can add your own picture..The touch screen lags a lot..Weather is only updated when the phone is near you and is connected with bluetooth and location..Same with alexa and music controls..If you keep brightness at level 1 then the battery lasts upto 15 days..Glass will easily get scratches which will ruin it's look...It has flashlight(torch) which helps a lot..If you are away from your phone then only time, heartrate, stress level, spo2 level, alarm, timer, sports mode and steps,calories,distance travelled works..Alexa obviously along with weather, music controls do not work without your phone near you that is connected to internet bluetooth and location...Overall it's a good purchase at this price point."

The replacement process was simple and easy … thank god n thanks to Amazon"
11171,4.0,"Alexa is not works in it, This is bad whats the importance of giving it."
11172,4.0,"I have received this product a couple of days ago and now I am going to give an honest review of it.

This product is a great item if you are looking for a budget smartwatch. For its price, it provides quite accurate measurements of your BPM, stress, SPO2 etc. I have verified it's measurements with an actual oximeter and it proved to be accurate. However, the pedometer of the watch randomly adds around 100 steps. The pedometer is accurate otherwise.

The touch display of the 1.69"" watch impressed me. The watch has a sharp display, and smooth touch, which makes you feel like you are on a smartphone. The response time is quite well too. However, the animations lag which is not very eye pleasing, but workable.

The battery is great. The watch would be powered on for one whole night and would not lose a single percent of battery. Even while using, it loses a reasonable amount of power. For first time users, who just received their product: You might notice the battery is draining extremely quick. Do not panic. It is recommended to charge the battery for at least 2 hours before first use. It stabilizes the battery. The next time you use your watch, it would work as normal.

The built-in Alexa is perhaps my favorite feature of this watch. It's response time is around 5 seconds, and is quite fun to use a virtual assistant on the go. It can tell you facts, jokes, weather, calculations, translations and loads of other stuff, which might be useful for quickly looking up something. However, Alexa does not have a speaker. It gives a text output. The text output can sometimes end with ""..."" (ellipses) which mean the output is too long to print. It can also fail to provide relevant output at times.
You need to log in to Alexa with your Amazon account in the boAt Wave App.

There are 100+ watch faces in the wave app, which you can use to customize your watch with whatever that suits your personality. You can even use your own pictures. However, you cannot customize the time font if you choose to do that, which, in my opinion, is quite limiting.

Notifications in the watch is pretty cool, and comes in handy when you do not wish to open your phone for it. Call alerts come, and you can reject them but not accept. Makes sense as the watch does not have a speaker. It vibrates.

It has a good build quality and is water-resistant.

Other cool features are sleep tracking, breathing exercise, alarms, timers, flashlights etc.

Overall, a pretty decent watch if you are looking for something in this range of price."
11173,4.0,Good battery 🔋 bkup.....also u can rec. Notification of whtup nd insta etc on screen
11174,4.0,Everything is good but once bluetooth connection disconnected then it won't connect automatically.. 😒
11175,4.0, Like as it shows time for what I ordered it
11176,4.0,"It's over all a good product. Battery runs 7 days non-stop after fully charged. Notifications work. Screen movement is not fluid don't expect at this price. But its still overpriced because these functions are available with other brands with lower range. I bought for 2999. So depends on you.
Works fine even in dusty or heavy rainfall. Belt quality is really sturdy. Screen glass is very good quality, almost many times I hit railings or equipments. I work in such environment. No scratches at all.
I'm satisfied with the tracking and sensors. Almost 95% accuracy.
I just wish manufacturers give an option of switching off the Bluetooth on the watch when not needed, just a food for thought."

11182,4.0,"I am a very huge fan of boat especially there service and warranty they never let their customers down asusual good

One tip - Dont use too much of watch faces in the app it has less storage so u avoid lag in a watch"
11183,4.0,"For the price it is good, looks pretty, but poor accuracy"
11184,4.0," Used this watch for over a month now.. Bought it during the first sale.. Keep reading for an unbiased review and tips/tricks to ensure all the functions in the watch are working smoothly.
1) Large Curved Display in this price category - 1.69 inch
2) Battery with heavy usage and frequently waking up the screen, alexa, alarms, notifications is about 3 days. On standby while just checking the time occassionally is about 8 days. Pretty good. Full charging time is about 1.5 hours. Decent quality magnetic charging cable provided. Use your own low power adapter, power bank or laptop.
3) Has all the necessary health / workout tracking options.. Spo2( Oxymeter), Heart Rate monitor..Accuracy is 95-98%. Sleep tracking is pretty accurate too. Paedometer is accurate most of the times, but sometimes few hundred steps are added randomly without any activity. This happens randomly once in 3-4 days. Stress Monitor is also there but not sure how it's calculated. The sensors aren not fake most probably because if the watch isn't in contact with your skin it will display a warning message and won't display data.
4) Lift to wake up gesture works but with a 1 second delay.. which is manageable. It has Tap to wake functionality too.
5) Works with most popular notifications: Whatsapp, SMS, Facebook, Instagram etc. Can read the entire SMS on watch and most of the other messages unless it's very long.
6) Calls can't be picked up or silenced.. You can only see the caller id and reject the call.
7) BT Music Control, Weather ☁️ update and Alexa are other usable smart features.
8) 50 different watch face are available on the Boat wave app. Some are really good.. You can also have customised wallpapers as watch faces . See the posted pictures.
9) The Boat Wave app is neatly organized and syncs health data without any issues instantly. The app also has assisted GPS functionality which can track your running activities on a map, in case you need that data.
10) The User Interface is smooth.. Please note that it's not laggy. The animations and transitions are a little slow but overall easy to use. Touch screen response is excellent and feels nice.
11) Overall construction is sturdy and feels nice and comfortable to wear it. It has water resistance of 5 ATM.. Can take it for a short duration swim in a pool, under the shower or rain without any worries. Watch uppper body is brushed aluminium and under body is good quality plastic. The straps are soft and also of very good quality. It doesn't irritate your skin even after wearing it for long durations. Four colour options are available with equally matching straps.. Straps can be easily replaced with fancy straps.
12 ) Works both with Android and iPhone flawlessly. Tested on both.

TIPs AND TRICKs ________________________________________

1) Boat wave app needs to run in the background all the time for your call notifications, message notifications, Alexa functionality and Weather updates. If you accidentally clear all the cache and background apps from the phone, the watch will disconnect from the phone after some time when idle ( no active inputs probably after 10-15 mins). Keep the boat wave app running in the background. Most people complaining that the watch frequently disconnected might unintentionally be clearing all the background apps. My watch was continuously connected for 4 straight days without me having to reconnect as long as the boat wave app was running in the background.

2) Alexa on this watch can do a lot of things..It can set your alarms, start the stopwatch, show weather, control Alexa based devices like Echo, wireless lights and AC, work as a simple calculator, translate simple/ short English sentences to German, Spanish, Italian, French and Portugese, get you common stock quotes from internet, can you snippets of general information from the internet in case you don't know something. Yes, Alexa on your watch getting you the information is a little slow, takes about 30 -40 seconds to process your request but it's convenient and better that taking out the phone from your pocket which might take similar amount of time or longer. In my personal experience, Alexa works a little faster on Android as compared to iphone ( maybe 2-3 second difference). Also if there is break while speaking or if there is a long sentence, then it's difficult for Alexa to understand.. Check my video.. Keep it short and you should get the results accurately
3) For Alexa to work properly: After connecting the Boat Wave app with an Amazon account, download the Alexa app and check your Xtend watch is visible under Devices option.
4) To pickup and make calls handsfree without using the phone, just use a Bluetooth headset with voice assistant function. It will work as a charm. The speaker function on most smart watches is useless as it's not convenient for calls while traveling or in a crowded place due to low volume and obviously you don't want everyone to hear your private conversation.. With voice assistant feature on your BT headset you can make a call or play music without having to touch your phone.

Few other functions which could have been provided and is missing. Actually available in many similarly priced devices :
1) Torch 🔦 - Makes the display bright white.. Comes handy in darkness.
2) Remote shutter button for camera.
3) Call silencing option could have been added."

Design, Build & Comfort
When buying a smartwatch, one always thinks about its design and look. Apart from features, design and build is another major aspect one should take care of when buying a smartwatch. The boat has worked on its design this time which brings it to a premium side in terms of look. The design is inspired by the Apple Watch 3, but it cannot be compared to that. Obviously, in every aspect, Apple Watch 3 would be much better than the Boat Xtend Smartwatch. Redmi Watch as well as Amazfit Bip U Pro has the same shape and design, but the build quality is much premium on this one.

Boat Xtend design and build
I personally don’t like the color scheme of this Boat Xtend Smartwatch. The black color variant comes with a golden color metallic frame. I believe the gold color would fade away after some time. There are three other color variants, which also don’t look stylish as this one. However, that is my personal opinion on the color scheme, so maybe you might find the color scheme to be good.

Boat Xtend design
The watch has 5ATM water resistance. It has silicon straps, which are quite comfortable. The straps are good quality straps which you will find comfortable with regular usage.

Display
Coming to the display, the watch has a 42mm square shape display. What you see on this one is a TFT panel. The screen has big bezels, however, the good part is that the screen goes completely back when it is off, so you won’t notice the bezels, and the screen quality won’t feel cheap at all. It doesn’t have an always-on display, but we cannot complain about that. The watch offers a screen on time of up to 20 seconds and up to 12 levels of brightness control.

Boat Xtend display quality
I find the display quality of the Boat Xtend Smartwatch to be better than the previous smartwatch from Boat. View angle is good on this one, and you can clearly see content on this smartwatch even in the sunlight. The color on this one is not very saturated, but this isn’t something that we can complain about in this price range.

Watch UI And Features
The UI of this smartwatch is clean and easy to use. There is a single button on the watch which works as the power/off button as well as the back button. Moreover, the display is a touchscreen display that works without any problem. There isn’t much animation on the bar menu, and the navigation is simple, so you won’t find it difficult to use. However, the watch may lag a bit. The company has done cost-cutting in terms of the processor, that’s why you may find it to lag a bit, but it is OK, and not a big deal at the price point you get it.

Boat Xtend Ui
The watch offers all the basic fitness features such as daily activity (which includes total steps walked, calories burnt, and time), heart rate, sleep tracking, stress tracking breath training, SpO2 training, meditation, find my phone, and music control. Apart from that, there are 14 different support modes on this watch. I tried a few of them, and they worked fine. The watch notifies you of the incoming calls, messages received, and various other notifications in detail.

Boat Xtend smartwatch review
Alexa Support
The main highlight of the Boat Xtend is the Amazon Alexa Support. The watch has an in-built microphone, and you can access it by long-pressing the back button. Do note that you can only do some basic tasks with Alexa on the watch like setting an alarm, setting a timer, and such. Well, it is a good thing to have Alexa on a watch, but you won’t find it very useful. Probably you will use it for a day or two out of excitement, and then you won’t prefer using it because it only does some basic tasks. So, even if Boat missed this feature, it won’t be a problem.

Boat Xtend Alexa support
Watch Faces
The next cool thing about this Boat Smartwatch is the watch faces you get on this one. You get more than 100 watch faces on the watch, and probably more watch faces will be added to it. Moreover, you can also set a custom watch face as well.

Boat Xtend watch faces
Boat Wave App
You will have to download the Boat Wave App to use the watch. The app is available for both Android as well as iOS devices. You won’t be seeing bugs on the app, and it works perfectly. I haven’t noticed any problem with connectivity like frequent disconnection. The interface of the Boat Wave is clean and simple. You will get all the fitness-related options and all the watch settings on the app itself.

Accuracy
Accuracy is one of the important aspects that one should take care of when buying a smartwatch. So talking about the accuracy, I tested everything on this watch, from normal walking to running, sleeping, and much more, and I find the results to be accurate.

Boat Xtend accuracy test
Compared to Realme or Redmi Watch, the result was the same on all of them. So, there is no problem with the accuracy. I don’t find the results to be accurate on most of the budget fitness trackers, but yes, this smartwatch is accurate in terms of fitness tracking, sleep tracking, and everything it does.

Boat Xtend accuracy
Comparing it to the Noise watch which we tried recently, the stress level as well as the SpO2 tracking is much more accurate on this one. It also has the option to track the menstrual cycle in women.

Boat Xtend accuracy
Battery
You get to see a 300mAH battery on this one, which the company claims to last 7 days. However, if you use most of the features of the watch, then the battery will last about two and a half days. If you keep the brightness low, then the battery will last about 3-4 days. I find the battery life to be a downside of the watch. It comes with magnet hook charging support.

Final Words
Boat Xtend Smartwatch is a decent smartwatch from the Boat. It offers all the basic fitness features you will find on a budget fitness tracker, a good display, Alexa support, good design and build, and much more. The smartwatch at this price is quite good. Personally, what I didn’t like about this smartwatch is its color scheme. However, if you like the color scheme, then I would recommend you to go for it. Overall the watch is good with nothing to dislike about it except for the battery life. The battery life on this one is quite low. The company claims it to have a battery life of 7 days, but with regular usage, it will last for 2-3 days. If you are looking for a good smartwatch under Rs.5000, and you can adjust with the battery life, and you like the color scheme, then I would recommend you to go for this smartwatch. It offers all the features that should be there in a smartwatch under Rs.5000."
11186,4.0,"Pros:

1. Premium build quality with matte finishing- sturdy polycarbonate frame, good soft silicone straps that r absolutely flush with the body of the watch. Attractive, trendy colours.
2. Heart Rate (except heart rate spikes in weight training), Pedometer(steps counter) are accurate but SPO2 is off by +/- 2% when compared to Pulse Oximeter readings. But most smart watches offer the same accuracy. Sleep tracking is accurate only for bed time & wake up time, duration but stages of sleep are inaccurate. Light, deep sleep, waking detected but no REM sleep detected. Sleep data from the watch synchronises smoothly with Boat Wave app. Issues warning msg if watch not worn on hand properly and does not detect data of surfaces.
3. Large (1.69""), clear bright, sharp LCD IPS display even in the sun.
4. Touch not smooth, experienced jitters. UI also lags at times & after attaching the tempered glass sometimes some functions require 02-03 taps to work. But acceptable scrolling response if finger moved diagonally instead of vertically.
5. In app GPS works superbly. Excellent route tracking on the map. This feature is not advertised in their description.
6. Bluetooth 5.0 connectivity is good if mobile is kept in close proximity(7m). The Boat Wave app must remain running in the background at all times.
7. Definitely splash proof though did'nt take the risk of submerging the watch.
8. All notifications are working, no problem with call alerts or SMS msgs or social media app notifications. No lags at all though there is provision for a 3 sec lag which can be turned on.
9. Alexa works superbly but since there is no speaker, info is displayed on the screen. My Wipro Smart Bulb, FireTV stick can be controlled easily using the inbuilt Alexa on the watch. Alexa can do mathematical calculations, currency conversions, even foreign language translations, apart from supplying info on anything under the sun. But ofcourse, Alexa cannot make calls. Alexa can set alarm, timer also.
10. Sedentary alert, drinking water reminder, stress alert, menstrual cycle alert, alarms, timers function well.
11. Boat Wave app connects easily & no lags observed. Data syncs smoothly with Google Fit app. Excellent health reports and motivational rewards system in the form of badges. But settings can be changed only through the app and the watch needs to be restarted for the new settings to be effective.
12. Training, Sports modes r good.
13. Guided Breathing mode is also good.
14. Find my phone works well.
15. Extremely stylish, light weight & comfortable for all day wear.
16. 07 watch faces available in the device with 04 preset which cannot be deleted. The rest can be changed from the Boat Wave app.

Cons:

1. Lacks vibration intensity control.
2. Lacks Camera control shutter. But can't figure out its use as my handset accepts both voice commands & gestures to click pics.
3. No quick reply messages for notifications/call alerts.
4. No call acceptance or silencing feature. A work around can be if bluetooth handset is connected at the same time.
5. SPO2 is not accurate and sometimes freezes at 97%. But this is common in all smart watches.
6. Battery does'nt last more than 03 days if continuous HR measurement is turned on. Otherwise easily lasts for 7 days.
7. Watch faces are very childish. Expected better quality designs. Company can easily improve on this in their next update.
8. Amazon Prime only replacement, no refund policy is not good. At least colour change should be allowed once.
9. Music control feature does not display the title of the song.
10. No BP monitoring or temperature monitoring feature. Smart watches usually do not provide reliable BP data.
11. No calling feature. But it does'nt matter as most don't want conversations to be public.
12. A bit large for narrow wrists, band @22 mm is a bit wide.
13. Company should provide a tempered glass protector. No mention of protective glass on the display mentioned. Have attached a Scot tempered glass purchased separately.
14. There are actually only 10 sports modes. Boat has bloated the list with Indoor-Outdoor combi of 4 sports (Walking, Running, Swimming, Cycling).
15. There is no light sensor. Auto brightness is only time dependant but works well.

Was a wedding anniversary gift for my wife who liked it very much even the colour- the evergreen, classic gold-black. Overall the best smart watch with Alexa built in, available at the budget price point of under Rs 3000. An excellent Fitness Tracker but average Health Monitor."
11187,4.0,"First I want to tell.
1.The watch want to update first either it will not work, so it reqest to seller to check the product before selling.

2. The product is very good and satisfied according to price.

3. I will suggest to purchase it. Coz all is better.

4. But seller should check the product before selling to customers.

5. Coz I had return it first then after I recived it, it better coz the device is not updated.

You need to log in to Alexa with your Amazon account in the boAt Wave App.

There are 100+ watch faces in the wave app, which you can use to customize your watch with whatever that suits your personality. You can even use your own pictures. However, you cannot customize the time font if you choose to do that, which, in my opinion, is quite limiting.

Notifications in the watch is pretty cool, and comes in handy when you do not wish to open your phone for it. Call alerts come, and you can reject them but not accept. Makes sense as the watch does not have a speaker. It vibrates.

It has a good build quality and is water-resistant.

Other cool features are sleep tracking, breathing exercise, alarms, timers, flashlights etc.

Overall, a pretty decent watch if you are looking for something in this range of price."
11223,4.0,Good battery 🔋 bkup.....also u can rec. Notification of whtup nd insta etc on screen
11224,4.0,Everything is good but once bluetooth connection disconnected then it won't connect automatically.. 😒
11225,4.0, Like as it shows time for what I ordered it
11226,4.0,"It's over all a good product. Battery runs 7 days non-stop after fully charged. Notifications work. Screen movement is not fluid don't expect at this price. But its still overpriced because these functions are available with other brands with lower range. I bought for 2999. So depends on you.
Works fine even in dusty or heavy rainfall. Belt quality is really sturdy. Screen glass is very good quality, almost many times I hit railings or equipments. I work in such environment. No scratches at all.
I'm satisfied with the tracking and sensors. Almost 95% accuracy.
I just wish manufacturers give an option of switching off the Bluetooth on the watch when not needed, just a food for thought."

11261,4.0,"- Has all basic features of a digital watch and some more to call it smartwatch.
- Touch screen responsiveness is good.
- Notifications for selected apps on phone is helpful.
- Call reject is also helpful, for example, while driving.
- There's no speaker or mic on this watch, so no Bluetooth calling (I didn't want BT calling).
- Music controls work with some music apps but I didn't find it good enough to use it often.
- Can't say much about accuracy of SpO2 sensor or the heart rate sensor. They do show some data and I am still trying to verify how good that data is.
- The step counter is nuts. Not reliable. It overcounts steps.
- There's absolutely no storage in this thing for spare watch faces or recording vitals and health data so if you're not connected to the phone, all data is probably getting lost. It does support syncing with Google fit which is reliably picking up data without me fiddling with it.
- If you pair with another phone watch face gets reset to default one which is pretty stupid.
- It took some getting used to the short screen timeout but I like that it conserves battery and keeps going for a week or more on single charge.
- The tilt sensor to turn screen on (the raise to wake thing) is nice and useful.
- 4 screen brightness levels are good.
- Watch face customisation feature seems like they've played a joke on me. It's crappy. I'd have liked watch face additions on app updates, none so far in about a month of using this.
- The strap is holding on good so far. I'd have liked a more skin-friendly strap because I tend to wear it more often than my analog watch.

EDIT (06-09-2022):
- I recently found that other Noise smartwatches have camera trigger function which is sorely missing from this one.
- The sports modes are way too specific and there are only 8 of them; they should have added a generic one for activities not included in the 8 available.

Of course now this is also unavailable. Good for you."

So bad"
11322,4.0,"The watch is great for the price. Most things work great. Has great battery life. As a dailywear, there's not much to worry about. It detects activity but that happens only after a considerable amount of time (20 minutes). One cannot change the activity detection sensitivity or time.

The watch is not very intuitive to use. It's usually great and most features can be accessed easily but certain things take more clicks and taps than should be required in a compact device. So all the features are there, but it takes a bit of time to find them.
Sleep tracking is decent.

Phone calls have good quality. People can hear your voice even if there is reasonable disturbance. If you answered through your phone and now want to switch to your watch, you cannot do that. And you can only save at most 10 contacts. You cannot dial numbers. But the mic and speaker of the watch is good

Also, a confusing thing is, why does the watch not have audio alarms, when it is capable of producing sound?"
11323,4.0,"good one i got this 1399 ... i write this review after 2 month usage .. battery is awesome if u not connected with phone it gives 10 days while connected in phone it battery life become 4 or 5 days .. if u need accurate calculate your heart beat ,walk pls go with another its worthy but not accurate , calling function and u can speak through connected with your phone dont expect high quality in call but its not bad it become average it has 150 plus watch faces and you can customise with your photos . mainly some time its failed with you connect with mobile ,i mainly facing this issue , and but at this price it's value for money budget friendly watch i will suggest for budget buys with bluetooth caling future ..."
11324,4.0,"I have tried BOAT and FIREBOLT also and found this as the best so returned the other two.
I will discuss the pros and cons but before that I must say that the accuracy of readings are pathetic especially sleep monitoring .
All the smartwatches in the market at this price range doesn't give accurate results as smartbands... I am disappointed with that .. but why I finally chose to keep the Noise buzz and return boat wave lite and FIREBOLT ninja call pro ----

Pros
1. Good battery life , better than FIREBOLT ninja which was about 2 days.. Noise gives almost 3 to 4 days battery life with normal usage.
2. Calling is quite good quality ( FIREBOLT was also good )
3. The settings of DND , SMART DND, SILENT , VIBRATION is better.
4. Vibration is good and really wakes u up unlike the other watches where vibration can't be adjusted and doesn't wake you up.. here vibration can be adjusted if you want more or less amount.

Cons
1. Pathetic accuracy. Don't take this watch if you are only looking for sleep monitoring , heart beat etc. It's better to buy a good smartband for that.
2. Interface is not the best but it's okay

I bought this calling watch for 1700 in the great Indian festival and I feel at this price range it was the best as I have used Boat wave lite(non calling watch at 1200) and FIREBOLT ninja call pro ( 1800rs ) .I finally decided to keep the Noise and return the rest."

Missing features at same price point are
1. Voice asst
2. Calculator
3. Games
4. Bp

Notifications stay like messages and have to be deleted like messages once in watch and again in phone.
Bluetooth calling is more like a tws earphone a separate function, but cannot play music or other streaming other than phone calls. Not even whatsapp calls. Practically nothing more than a show off. Wrist turn awake to show time is a good feature especially with disable feature at night but it takes a second to turn on which is slow.
Auto detection of workouts did show up after 5 mins of walking but never recorded anything. Reminders are not repeatable. Alarms cannot be named. Watch faces are not impressive.

Strap is plugbin type and notnpin type so is proprietary and not generic pin type.

Unable to return it for better deals even if not happy with features/performance"
11335,4.0,"This my first smart watch I have owned, though I am not a tech paralyse. I know am a bit techie, therefore here is my review.
pros -
1. Easy to use and easy to connect.
2. Accurate data analysied.
3. Never disconnect in calls, just one tap connect.
4. Basic interference to use.
5. Bluetooth is good.
6. yes this is waterproof, went in shower with this on nothing happen but dont over do it.
7. Good watch faces could add more.

cons -
1. Battery life - yes, everyone talking that battery is good, though it is good but was expecting better battery life. with call features on max 2 days it can restarin.
2. Could add a ringtone ! my personal choice.
3. wrist awake feature is not good.

conclusion - This watch is good in this price but not best in class. If you can spend more you will get better watch this."

4. Basic interference to use.
5. Bluetooth is good.
6. yes this is waterproof, went in shower with this on nothing happen but dont over do it.
7. Good watch faces could add more.

cons -
1. Battery life - yes, everyone talking that battery is good, though it is good but was expecting better battery life. with call features on max 2 days it can restarin.
2. Could add a ringtone ! my personal choice.
3. wrist awake feature is not good.

conclusion - This watch is good in this price but not best in class. If you can spend more you will get better watch this."

11386,4.0,I got it for 1499/- during Great Indian sell. So at this price point it is good. But one thing i do not like is i can't stop it's Bluetooth if i plan to use it as only watch. That drains is battery. Otherwise battery will last much much more than one week.

11594,4.0,Does not support 128 GB card
11595,4.0,I have recieved the product yesterday and today i have installed it. When i was trying to add the device to the ezycam+ app it shows up tht the device is being used by another account. I called CP plus and informed and they said tht someone might have used it earlier and we need to send a request to unbind the previous account which would take 48hrs. I think they have sold an old product to me otherwise why would be if already in use. Pathetic experience
11596,4.0,very nice but i got simple cable instead of c -type cable with this ...

11603,4.0,one of the best camera...It's best features are motion detection and advance night vision which makes it best suit for ensuring safety at home. It also has built in microphone and speaker which let's you talk to any member without actually getting up. happy with upgrading my security with this pro product
11604,4.0,"I bought this product on sale, and it is absolute value for money. It has a 2MP camera with full HD as well as night vision. I was able to install it quite easily and connect it with my wifi, the video quality is really good. It is definitely a really good surveillance equipment. 2 Way Audio, as well as motion sensor at this price point is definitely a steal."

11609,4.0,"I have a pet at home and sometimes he is alone and I get worried. Now I can see what he is upto and if he is being mischievous, I can tell him things through the 2 way talk feature. Happy with the camera that I got"
11610,4.0,This is a wonderful product to gift your loved ones who has a creative side. It is light weight and is so easy to use. The picture quality is brilliant and it brings so much joy just clicking pictures with this amazing product. There are so many various picture formats that you can have by buying the right film for the camera. The brightness can be adjusted as per your liking. It is a great product!
11611,4.0,"the lights on modes won’t stop beeping whenever i put my batteries on. i had a problem last month when i put new roll of film and took the first shot, it got stuck and i have been having this issue. i’ve only used mini9 from december 2021, i like it and i wanna keep it that way. my camera won’t take any pictures now, need help"
11612,4.0," It’s super cute. Worth every penny. It doesn’t come with reels, gotta order it separately. Definitely recommended."
11613,4.0,"Cost of consumables must be kept in mind before purchasing such products.

In Todays World its more like TOY since consumables too costly and no options to transfer ( SAVE ) photos thro' other options like memory card/usb.

If instant physical copy of photos is in mind, one may buy the same. Otherwise think of other better options for Photography, where one is not satisfied with few photos and cost of consumables too high ( w r t INDIA )"
11614,4.0,"Purchased on 5.09.18 for Rs 3999/- in lightning deal [ Colour Cobalt Blue] .Delivered 11.09.18. Camera used for the first time on 17.09.18 on Vishwakarma Puja. Films and camera case purchased separately from market and are cheaper than online rate . Camera is made in Thailand .Camera has functioned well so far , however, the battery cover has become loose within 3days.

I am a novice in normal photogaphy ( i.e., I use only point & shoot cameras as in mobile phones). Some reviewers have described Fuji Instax Mini as a toy but I do not agree with them. If you like experimenting with photography ,you should try this. If you like something just for fun then too try this.

Instant camera means you have just one chance. The photo may be good or bad depending how you handle it.But this process is immensely satisfying as you strive to improve. The camera comes with good instruction sheet. Read it carefully. Also watch online instruction videos - just Google Fuji Instax Mini 9 & you will come across several. They will show you in detail how to load battery, films and start taking photos. I watched these films before I took the first photo & it came out quite nicely. The camera suggests lightning and I strongly recommend that you follow it, until you become an expert in instant photography. The charm is to see you photos develop instantly and the pleasure of taking autograph on spot (if you take a photo of someone you admire) or presenting a photo to someone.

Load film cartridge exactly as given in instructions .Open foil preferably in dimly lighted room, slip cartridge inside(see videos ), then press the shutter. A film cover will pop out. the camera will show that 10 films are loaded. Now it is ready to use. As you take photos, the camera will indicate how many films left.

A photo takes about 3 minutes to develop fully. DO NOT SHAKE THE PHOTO. Just put it gently on a flat surface, away from strong light. After 3 mins, show it to everyone. Store photos in albums.

Use the close-up lens to get good photos. Distance should be between 35 -50cm, not more. Without lens it should be 60cm to 2.5m. Instant photography is not for people in a hurry. Films are expensive, so you have to be patient when you take photos. Some times better results come for the photographer to sit down & take instant photo. I took the first photo sitting on a bench. I have not yet taken a selfie so I cant comment on that aspect. The photos are small in size like an ATM card.So you should plan what photos to take. If for eg you take full figure the person photographed will look tiny. In my childhood days of black & white photography with non-digital film cameras or box camera as they were called, small square photos used to be developed. The photos in the instax mini are about that type (though not square). If you have old black & white photos at home, it will give you an idea about size of the subject in photos.

I initially wanted to own this camera because of its colours. I followed Amazon pricing for more than one year, before I plunged in the lightning deal. I took the decision to buy it recently,after someone took my instant photo( in a more expensive camera) & presented it to me. Fuji instax mini is the cheapest among instant cameras. Try it and you will get addicted."
11615,4.0,Ok
11616,4.0,Easy to use and gives retro look to pics
11617,4.0,I didn't buy it for myself bought it for a friend's bday. My friend love it. The picture quality was more than I expected from its looks. The size was comfortable and looked cute.
11618,4.0,"So I ordered this Fujifilm instant camera and in the bullet points of this camera, it is clearly mentioned that it has ''Approximately 10 instax mini film packs with new AA batteries) ; Film Feeding out: Automatic'', but to my knowledge it has no film packs."
11619,4.0,ABSOLUTELY ITS WORTH EVERY PENNY💗
11620,4.0,Genuine product

11623,4.0," I gave it as a gift to my son but when he opened it and tried to take pictures nothing was happening and the orange light around the len keeps blinking

Either send a replacement or refund"
11624,4.0,JUST A WASTE OF MONEY. SUCH EXPENSIVE FILM AND PICTURE QUALITY IS JUST VERY POOR. IT GIVES BLACK BACKGROUND TO INDOOR PICTURES. USELESS PRODUCT . WASTAGE OF MONEY
11625,4.0,Quality is pretty good and easy to use must have it too catch memories
11626,4.0, To the best purchases done so far ….. its amazing easy to use and images comes out so pretty clear . I had ordered lime green colour and it was so damn beautifull 😍😍 … would recommend to everyone out there do go for it if you are thinking to buy one. Highly recommended ♥️♥️
11627,4.0,Go for it
11628,4.0,Not working this camera when I clicked only blank pictures outside
11629,4.0,"I ordered Fujifilm Instantx mini 9 Instant Camera (Ice Blue) from amazon on 5th June and got it by 10th(a day before amazon promised).
Packaging of the product was not so secure, as i thought it is an electronic appliance it should have been bubble rapped and then put it in a box. (But i received my product in great condition.)
In box i received, the items as mentioned by the seller. I also ordered the Fujifilm Instax mini shot films-value pack of 6 with the Camera.
After inserting the film and placing the AA batteries(which i received with camera) , i was ready to cliq my first shot, (though first cliq was a blank shot) (the second cliq was the image) the image quality considering the room light was good(not excellent), but for few moments that camera took me to our good golden days where you have to choose wisely whether the scene is beautiful enough to pictured as we cant follow trial and error method with this camera. that creeeking sound and their was my first shot. The image takes almost 40-50 secs before appearing.
Though the size of the film is little small but it perfectly gives you the feel of instant camera. The mirror to take selfies is a nicely placed and a great help to place our face in correct direction.
Overall, i would say, Fujifilm instax mini 9 is great purchase, it offers you the retro vibe in a much less cost."
11630,4.0,Is not working
11631,4.0,Product quality is good. But the picture are really bad. It has a no bath factor but pictures are extremely dark.
11632,4.0,"Yep. The camera captures good photos in bright light. However indoor lighting isn't sufficient to bring out the shadows and a lot of the image is just black.

After taking ~15 pics the picture would start to get stuck while it was printing out and then the camera stopped working.
All the lights keep lighting up - tried changing battery didn't help.

Have to take it to the service center to get it fixed.
Hopefully it works fine after that.

But I was overall happy with the product when it was working."
11633,4.0,"I bought it for my wife's bday. She and I are not the people who are camera frenzy and we hardly end up taking any pics on phone.
I thought this would change the meoria.
It did! Awesome quality for selfies or short landscape mode pics. I really love the filters which helped in taking different types of pics .
Although outdated, this is one of the most interesting puchases ever made.
Worth the money!!"
11634,4.0,"This review comes from someone who has already used Instax Mini 8. The newer variant - Mini 9 is no different, or may be slightly better - but overall still a disappointment.

Don't go by the pictures used for marketing this camera. The picture quality in reality is not even close to what they show on the packaging / marketing / promos.

Be prepared to get disappointed with below average photos which are not even close to what you would expect from an Instant camera.

This camera only satiates your thirst for 'instant gratification'. Once the initial few photos come out, you will be left with a permanent sense of disappointment.

I am thankful to Amazon to offer me a replacement because I received a faulty camera the first time."
11635,4.0,I found it really fun to have kind of camera.. best part is that you get the photos instantly and can save and share ot as a memory with them loved ones. Downside is that it photos are best captured in daylight in outdoors.. indoor pics are not that good. But overall its worth it. Note that the film is costly. But again if you wish to have the luxury of instant pics its worth investing in this camera
11636,4.0,"Firstly, the picture didn't appeared and when the pictures appeared the quality of picture is really poor."
11637,4.0,"Go for it but keep that in mind it can feel costly for you and they don't even provide a film roll too, you need to buy one. Which cost approx 500rs per roll which has 10 pictures... It's upto you small cost to pay for an iconic feel..."
11638,4.0,Picture quality isn’t great but it’s not bad either. It’s a good product for the price. So happy with the purchase.
11639,4.0,"Got faulty prices twice. Packet was tampered during first delivery and the second peice too never worked. Since it was a gift to someone, by the time i got to know about the fault the return window had closed."
11640,4.0,Good one
11641,4.0,In sun its over exposure and in low light its very dark photos
11642,5.0,"Mother board will be broken in case if u have a low charge battery inside
No warnings no errors but directly motherboard will be broken
Issue is resolved in Instax 11 is what I came to know from service centre
So don’t buy instax 9 if the issue come after warranty period service cost is same as camera price
In case if you already have instax 9 please use new battery after 20 shots or long storage period"
11643,4.0,"The photos were completely useless below 10°C (couldn't develop properly). Also at slightly low brightness, it dissapoints. Only photos which arr taken in very bright condition and a temperature > 12°C develops properly."
11644,4.0,"The camera, look-wise, is real cute and nice, especially in the mint blue colour that I ordered. It’s easy to operate and gives you instant pictures for memorabilia. But the picture quality is what they need to improve on. Even in broad sunlight with proper settings, the picture appears to be a bit darker, and a little bit blur. You really need to take care of the surrounding lighting in which you click the picture using it. The films are costly, so you would not want any of your shot to be bad."
11645,4.0,"Instant camera will make anyone happy as it would print photo within few seconds of a click!! But sad part is that buying a film is very expensive as it has only 10 in each film , that way cannot experiment on clicks, its very disappointing if the photo doesn't come as expected due to the fact film is costly!! Also camera settings you will have to get used to it as there is always a flash, you would waste every film until you get the hang of it!! To also mind the size of photo, its exactly a credit card size that's all!!"
11646,4.0,a lil too small but overall good! 📷
11647,4.0,"It is a kids camera. Picture quality is just OK if you click with 2-3 ft distance. But it is super easy to use, even putting sheets for photo is super easy. Good feel for kids. Do expect a good quality photo and don't expect to click a group photo because for that you have click from distance and the photo will be ruined."
11648,4.0,Film is very costly
11649,4.0,"Well, Ideal gift for boys and perfect fit for a small party.
I feel the frame size of the film is smaller than expected.
Feel worth the money"
11650,4.0,"This camera is handy,portable and children friendly, easy to carry around! The one sale point of this camera= instant camera.
One point why not to buy it:
The film developing print sheet is very costly, obviously children are very excited to use it to make it ,20 sheets will be emptied in under 5 minutes that 1500 to 2000 Indian Rupees n they will get on your nerves for another 20 sheet pack,you got surplus money to waste go ahead n buy it for your kid.
Picture quality ok
You need technique to develop the photos
Buy it, use it once then box it n forgot it!"
11651,4.0,There is no repairing centre in Dimapur if you would suggest a way would be great
11652,4.0,"Good product, did not expect great photo ability so was not disappointed. It's not a digital camera🙂
If it's for kids, make sure to give a heads up of refill cartilage cost."
11653,4.0,"The camera is good but the films are way too expensive. They should have included atleast 10 films with camera. However you have to buy it sepearately.
Think twice before buying as once you bought it you cannot return it. You can only replace the product."
11654,4.0,"I like this camera coz when I was a kid my father used to own one and it sure gives a nostalgia towards the Polaroid Camera.
With that it is indeed a easy to use camera, Just click and bam the Polaroid appears from the slot.
The only thing that I didn't like is that there are no extra film package is included with the purchase. I meam of the company would have given just 1 extra film package it would be an offer non can refuse.
None-the-less I like this camera and I would recommend everyone to try if they like those old photos that you can hold and enjoy rather tham the digital ones."

If it's for kids, make sure to give a heads up of refill cartilage cost."
11698,4.0,"The camera is good but the films are way too expensive. They should have included atleast 10 films with camera. However you have to buy it sepearately.

11699,4.0,"I like this camera coz when I was a kid my father used to own one and it sure gives a nostalgia towards the Polaroid Camera.
With that it is indeed a easy to use camera, Just click and bam the Polaroid appears from the slot.
The only thing that I didn't like is that there are no extra film package is included with the purchase. I meam of the company would have given just 1 extra film package it would be an offer non can refuse.
None-the-less I like this camera and I would recommend everyone to try if they like those old photos that you can hold and enjoy rather tham the digital ones."
11700,4.0,Print quality is very good with photos taken from mobile..but camer inbuilt camera is not that good
11701,4.0," This is a perfect camera with Good quality and size photo. Also easy to click and print. But honestly was able to click just 10pics from the default cartridge and when I replaced it with the new Kodak cartridge came along with the package, it started showing UNABLE TO PICKUP PICTURE and I had to remove the cartridge and replace again and again which destroyed one cartridge. It hardly started working then for few pics and started showing REPLACE THE CARTRIDGE… it is pain now because I cannot return and cannot use either."

11708,4.0,Do not buy this product
11709,4.0,"R&D team of these point ,shoot and print cameras need to be fired . No wonder Kodak is becoming a loss making company .

These products simply spoil the reputation of instant photo cameras of the past . The print quality is a bit better than junk .

They do not fall into a gimmick category as well since print medias are quite expensive .

Better buy a portable photo printer and get good results .

In any case prints are needed only when you come back from vacation."
11710,4.0,"Le pack:
- Le pack est très complet. On en a pour son argent.
-- on y retrouve 2 recharges de 30 photos
-- une pochette de protection qualitative qui va très bien avec l appareil et donne du style
-- il y a une petite boîte pour y mettre les photos
-- il y a un petit album pour y mettre les meilleurs photos prises
-- une petite cordelette avec des pinces pour accrocher des photos
-- des stickers
-- l appareil

En bref un beau pack.

Ça se gâte un peu qu niveau de l appareil en lui même. L'application Kodak pour imprimer les photos n'est pas convainquante. Elle est lente et mal pensée.
En lui même l'appareil, il est pas trop lourd, l'impression fonctionne bien mais le petit logiciel embarqué dessus déconne un peu lors de la prise de photos. Il ne faut pas être très exigeant. La prise de photo n'est pas de grosse qualité, c'est du 10MP donc logique mais le rendu lors de l impression peut paraître pixelisée. Je pense qu il faut de l expérience et ne pas regarder de trop près.

Pour finir, le flash. Quant on prends des photos avec le flash, le rendu affiché sur l écran est pris juste avant le flash. Du coup quand on imprime on a de sacrés surprises.

Ensuite l'impression des photos depuis le téléphone portable sont vraiment bien.

Du coup c'est un bon appareil mais tout n'est pas parfait.

Vu le pack, vu le prix et le prix des recharges, ça permet de compenser je trouve certain des défauts. Il y a tout de même de quoi s amuser !"
11711,4.0,
11712,4.0,"I like my gadgets and thought this would be a fun addition to print some pictures and use as an old school instant camera. It’s good but does have its flaws.
What I like:
- it came with the camera and 3 packs of film which I thought was good value
- the fact you can print direct from your smart phone was the major factor that sold me this camera
- the prints are ok, they’re a bit of fun but do not expect quality like you get from the machines in boots and supermarkets etc
- I like that you can print and take photos
- it’s quite compact so easy to travel with
- simple enough to charge up
- simple enough to download and use the partner app
- great fun seeing the picture slide in and out as it develops and laminates
What I don’t like:
- picture quality and colour reproduction isn’t great
- using as a camera can be tricky is the screen is tiny and framing a decent picture can be hit or miss better to take the picture on your phone then print on the Kodak
- prints are quite small"
11713,4.0,"The print quality is excellent, especially when you use the app and sync it to your phone where you can edit and crop photos before printing them. The camera feature is kind of a joke, the print quality when using the built in camera is pretty bad so don't bother with that unless you're in a pinch without a phone. A few things to be aware of, a single charge will print about 5-10 photos before needing to be recharged. This is fine for most situations but if you're at an event or party where you might want to print more than 10 photos, it can be kind of annoying. I ended up plugging it in to a USB power bank to keep it going. Another drawback is that if you're printing several photos in a short time span, such as using the multiple prints feature in the app, the printer will overhead and give you a ""overheat warning"" and it will freeze for 10 or more minutes until the printer cools down. The last thing to be aware of if that the 4-pass function is very slow since it prints each color one by one. I just wanted to point out these drawbacks that I wish I knew about before buying this printer, but overall I would still buy it again for the quality."
11714,4.0,"only managed to push out one picture (which only came out in yellow) and then said that a new cartridge was required when i tried to print out a different picture. It was a brand new cartridge. tried many different things to fix the problem and nothing worked. the instructions that come in the box and those on the website did not help either. very disappointed, waste of money."
11715,4.0,"The Kodak Mini Shot 3 is a cool little camera. As a camera its ok at best. The picture quality I'd say is a 3 out of 5. The screen in the back isn't the best either. It looks like a screen from an early 2000's flip phone. The last negative I have is that when printing, the highlights are kind of blown out. Ok now for the good stuff. They have good options when it comes to printing. You can choose borderless, border, monochrome, and filters. It is a fun little camera that brings that retro vibe. Printing takes about 30 seconds. Using the camera is super easy. There is a total of 7 buttons and they are self-explanatory. The best part about this camera is that it has Bluetooth to connect to your phone, and allows you to print pictures directly from your phone. I saw this camera at an airbnb I stayed at and thought it was a cool, and fun way to make memories with families and friends. I would recommend this camera."

11723,4.0,"Non si può pretendere una qualità di stampa elevata ma la fotocamera è un ottima idea regalo ed è bello sapere di poter stampare le foto che ti piacciono di più, quando vuoi, direttamente a casa!
Il vantaggio non sta nello scattare istantanee, ma nel collegamento bluetooth ad un cellulare per la stampa di foto di qualità e luminosità superiore. Vale molto come stampante, poco come macchina fotografica moderna."
11724,4.0,
11725,4.0,"The camera is okay, the photo on the right was taken with my phone and printed out with the camera while the one on the left was taken with the camera itself. Maybe in better lighting the camera quality is better but Im pretty much only using this as a photo printer. You also cant save any photos on the camera itself."
11726,4.0,"partiamo prima dai difetti, la macchina é piacevole e compatta, ma la costruzione e mediocre come il piccolissimo monitor, non permette nessuna modifica della foto una volta scattato, quindi i vari preset si devono applicare prima di scattre. ma questi limiti vengono ripagati dalla stampa a sublimazione, decisamente migliore delle instax fuji, colori e neri decisamente piu realistici e naturali, le foto sono inoltre piu grandi delle square fuji, durano di piu, le danno a 100 anni, mentre le altre gia cominciano a sbiadirsi dopo pochi anni, ed infine costano 1/3 delle instax.
altro aspetto che metto nei pro, pur essendo una digitale si usa come una vera macchina istantanea, con l'impossibilita di modificare le foto, dopo che hai scattato guardi come e venuta e decidi subito se cancellare o stampare, mentre con le digitali instax le foto finiscono in memoria perche poi si vuole sempre pastrocchiare per modificare e perdi la naturalezza dello scatta e stampa"
11727,4.0,
11728,4.0,"I love this camara. Its decent quality (its a retro camara. Dont expect 4k pictures from the camara) but ur gonna be using its printer function more often than the camara function. The printer works very well and will print good quality pictures from your phone. The app can be a bit of a hassle. But overall this printer is great. I like having the camara feature but i think most of you could save 50 bucks by just getting the printer.

HOWEVER, i recommend making sure the print size has an album that you can buy. Im screwed because apparantly photo albums for pictures sized 3×3 dont exist. Kodak doesnt sell the album separately and i cant find a seller that has 3×3 photo slots. And i dont wanna use the sticky page photo albums. The most common photo sizes today seem to be 2×3 and 4×6. However the polaroids are popular so you can find albums for the square polaroids. Fair warning though, the square polaroids are bigger than 3×3"
11729,4.0,撮影画素数が低すぎて、印刷された写真の品質が低すぎます。
11730,4.0,
11731,4.0,"Picture quality is lacking for photos taken on the camera but are excellent with photos imported from the app.

If printing borderless the picture does not always center and can crop edges of the photo out.

If printing bordered there is sometimes a 1/16 to 1/8 inch variation in border size edge to edge (photo is slanted) not much but noticeable.

LCD screen is very laggy and has horrible contrast making it difficult to see if photos are blurry from motion, lower than expected shutter speed.

4 pass technology makes really nice looking photos but it takes an awkward amount of time to get the print out, just over 60 seconds.

Will mostly use this as a printer for photos taken on my phone, the app is very easy to use and has basic adjustments for brightness, saturation, and sharpness."
11732,4.0,"Es para una niña de 14 años y la verdad es que el tamaño me parece muy desproporcionado; si que es cierto que el tamaño es grande ya que la foto impresa es también grande, pero me parece dificil de manejar, además que la pantallita de atrás es útil pero muy pequeña. La foto sale relativamente bien para ser una foto instantanea pero el tamaño de la pantalla y de la cámara en si no se correlicionan"
11733,4.0,
11734,4.0,"La idea de disponer una camara estilo retro con posibilidad de impresion digital por sublimacion esta muy bien. La construccion, a nivel de materiales, no es mala en mi opinion. Sin embargo por el precio que tiene, el fabricante no ofrece lo que deberia. El sensor de la camara es mediocre, muy mediocre. Camaras infantiles de 10 euros sacan mejores fotos. Por otro lado, el display pudieran haberlo elegido con algo mas de resolucion, no hacia falta mas tamaño, en el concepto de camara que tenemos entre manos.

Pero el talon de aquiles de esta camara es el software o firmware de la camara. Se nota que es un desarrollo de minimos, y en cierto modo inacabado, con unas funciones minimas y si apuras, poco intuitivas. De nuevo, cualquier camara de gama muy baja supera en el sofware a esta, y ciertamente no lo entiendo.

Otra cosa que no se entiende es que no hayan incorporado una memoria minima para guardar 50 o 100 fotos. Dada la calidad del sensor, supongo que con 256mb hubiera sobrado, para no tener que imprimir en el momento.

Quizas una actualizacion del firmware pueda dotar de estas funciones en el futuro, quien sabe.

En definitiva, la camara esta bien, , calidad justa, pero es como si se hubieran quedado a medias en su desarrollo.

Lo mejor, entre comillas, es la app de kodak y la posibilidad de enviar por bluetooth a la camara una foto hecha con el movil, por ejemplo, e imprimirla, y sale algo mejor."

11746,4.0,"Bought this as a gift for my wife who loves to print. It looks and feels
Great. Love the accessories you can get with it but the only problem we have found is sometime the paper won’t print and you have to insert a new cartridge. It’s not often but you could loose 2-3 prints per one and with it only holding 10 I think it soon mounts up. As a camera it’s not great for detail pictures but outside use in light enough conditions it’s fine. We use our phones for photos and she uses the camera just to print. Happy enough with it and would
Recommend even with the odd issue but it’s quirky and fun."

11763,4.0,"Questa Kodak Mini Shot 3 Retro non posso paragonarla con altre macchine fotografiche del segmento perchè non ne ho altre; comunque nel complesso mi ritengo soddisfatto. Comprata prevalentemente per uso didattico; la consiglio ai docenti che hanno alunni con bisogni educativi speciali. Prevalentemente viene utilizzata da tutte le fasce di età nel tempo libero. Le dimensioni, il peso e la robustezza sono in linea con le foto che deve stampare. Abbastanza facile da usare sia con i pulsanti della macchina, sia con l'applicazione da scaricare sullo smartphone. Bene per la presenza delle luci di notifica per l'accensione, il collegamento bluetooth e la ricarica (rosso/verde). Utile il laccio laterale per tenerla, volendo, anche al polso. Considerando il mitico marchio KODAK, si potrebbero aumentare i megapixel della fotocamera e ingradire leggermente lo schermo, c'è lo spazio per farlo; inoltre trovo curioso la mancanza di più scelte nel linguaggio per l'utente (personalmente manca l'italiano). Sufficientemente intuibile il funzionamento dei comandi; questo aspetto ne facilita l'uso anche in assenza della propria lingua. Non so se la qualità della stampa è già di per se molto alta o se si può agire sui megapixel o sulla carta predisposta; a volte il bianco della foto in immagine viene stampato fisicamente in azzurrino."
11764,5.0,
11765,5.0,"First off, horrible picture quality. 2nd. It doesn't cache any images at all nor does it tell you when there's no film left or when it's low battery so if you take a great photo and there's no film left to print it it tells you replace the film then ERASES THE PHOTO. It also does this when it's on low battery AND WHEN ITS OVERHEATING!! It will overheat after printing 4 images in succession. Which is hilarious because it gives you the option to print up to 5 copies but it never makes it past 4 (when it even prints the extra copies you requested at all) .

On top of all of that the LCD screen on the back is a complete joke. Looks like a relic from 2004 maybe. Grainy and super low resolution it's impossible to see any detail on the viewfinder screen. Like shoot the image and it's your best guess what it looks like until printed.

And don't even get me started on the shady app that's required to print photos from your phone. It demands permission to access everything! your CONTACTS, GPS, even your MICROPHONE!! Why would a camera printing app need access to your microphone?! A complete lack of privacy for users, an blatant data collection scam The app itself is obviously meant to data dig more than its made to print photos. Just a disgusting deplorable cheap garbage product. No wonder the ""film"" is so cheap!"

11780,5.0,"As this is my first DSLR camera, and the experience is superb, Must recommended in this price range"
11781,2.0,"I bought this camera with absolutely no knowledge about aperature, iso, shutter speed, etc.

1. This camera is very user friendly. The knobs with explanation on screen is easy to understand. I got some great pics with auto mode and that encouraged me to take more pics.

2. The difference of 9 vs 11 auto focus might be apparent if you have used camera with 11 AF points. For me, 9 was good enough as they are centered in middle of screen. In some occasions where we want to focus on birds, objects near rear of screen, manual focus need to be done. Otherwise AF points are excellent.

3. In built flash is as good as we hope for. For nearby objects, flash is bright and pictures look great. Typewriter pic is taken during night time.

4. Battery is awesome. Canon promised 500 photos. I guess that's enough for normal user. Agreed Nikon gives 1500 pics but I considered availability and cost factor and went for canon. I have been using it everyday from date of purchase and I have charged the battery once a week max. Really it's not like phone battery to charge at end of the day.

5. Picture quality in auto mode is mind blowing. Smartphone all look like toy when using DSLR. With all hype of 64 MP, 108 MP camera in phone, I thought DSLR will just give similar results. Oh boy! I was wrong. Canon portrait pics are many many levels above best smartphone camera pics.

6. I got it with 18-55 mm kit lens. Unless you like to take pics of objects in home and going to use it for taking portrait pics or family outing, this lens is not sufficient to enjoy DSLR. I very strongly urge you to go for 250 mm lens(70-300 mm may be but 250mm is best).

7. Canon image cloud option is very useful. Unfortunately I am not able to upload high quality images-- image size reduces to less than 1 MB during upload. Nevertheless, that option is good.

8. Taking video is pain and it drains battery. This is apt for taking still photos. Also video is restricted to 30 minutes.

9. There are dedicated modes for macro, sports, landscape, food, etc. They just have right settings like higher aperature for landscape etc to get best shot.

10. Learn photos editing software and get one. I thought they were bogus but it turns out you definitely need them.

No need to buy UV lens protection. Get a tripod. Also good memory card. A hood. Good camera bag. You are ready to enter into world of DSLR and definitely canon motivates you to do more."

11789,2.0,"Providing Basic accessories with this package have been curtailed down, which is not an usual scenario. Earlier memory card or bags were included in the package,now without memory card I am unable to check the product quality or use it during festival. I had to order for memory card which would be delivered when festival is over."
11790,5.0,"Let me explain.

Yes, with 9 point AF with the OVF, you'll feel the AF a bit dated but does the job rather well. Live view has face detect but has a jerky continuous AF and is slow.

But those are most of its negatives.

The camera takes wonderful pictures and with digic 4+ image processor, the jpegs are perfectly usable. If you want perfection, shooting in RAW will give you what you need.

The colors captured on this camera are perfect and natural, with settings to tweak them to your taste (see picture settings in menu).

The build quality is solid and ergonomics of the camera, especially through its grip is wonderful. It feels perfect in my hands. The menu system is uncluttered and quite intuitive. It is very easy to customize the camera to your specific needs.

You can shoot videos with this camera but without continuous AF, you'll get better results if you switch to manual focus during video.

Why is it the best DSLR?
Because of it's limitations in AF and simple straightforward usability it lets you take control over your photographs and videos unlike other advanced models which take control away from you and makes the choices for you. The result is you can get the exact photograph you intended to take. Combined with the 24 megapixel sensor, which is the same sensor found in almost all other canon APSC DSLRs, all the way upto 80D, the image quality is at par with much more expensive cameras.

The digic 4+ processor is good for image processing, frankly the more advanced processors bring features such as 4K and such, which if you're not into video, you'll not miss it. The digic 4+ processor is more than adequate for your photography needs.

With all the above considerations, it's the best DSLR you could get, in my opinion."
11791,5.0,"The settings are very easy to learn. I have 18-55mm lens and one might need to go for 55-250mm for even better zoom.

3.The memory card you get with the package can give you the speed hoto 48mbps . If you want good SDHC Memory card you can go for Sandisk 32 gb or Higher . It will give you a speed of 90mbps.
4.You will get a diopter adjustment dial just at the right side of the optical view finder.
5.Screen brightness at level 4 is probably enough for everyone , where you can extend the lcd brightness hoto 8th level . You van guess how much bright it's actually . Easy for outdoors also.

👉 It's a bit noisy when you shoot in low light , so try to keep atleast minimum light source near your object . Try to keep ISO minimum , change your shutter speed , keep it at 1/10 or lower if the condition outside is too much dark .
The price for which I got these is around 24000 . At this amazing price you are getting a branded DSLR which is basically for beginners , so you may have some complaints about the stuff but believe me it's probably the best option out there with a huge range of modes and operations. Go and grab it, start your experiments with your frames 😊😊😊 ."

11813,4.0,"The camera is an excellent option for those who are just newly stepping into photography field as it can give them all the tools needed to develop their skills.
Performance as an entry-level camera is good. It has Wifi inbuilt in so the users can transfer their files from the camera to smart devices.. Canon1500D has a superior sensor over the older EOS 1300D Thus, overall image quality is much better. Color saturation is decent and a fair amount of sharpness , As far as noise is concerned, the camera handles shots well up to ISO 1600 with a little amount of grains Even at ISO 800, the noise levels are acceptable. Increasing ISO to 1600 increases the noise but the images were still good enough to be shared on social medias. Autofocus is fast enough when using the viewfinder but once switch to Live View mode and it really struggles to get the focus. Overall i would recommend the camera to anyone who is starting into photography .

11822,5.0,Product is very good picture quality
11823,1.0,"As this is my first DSLR camera, and the experience is superb, Must recommended in this price range"
11824,5.0,"I bought this camera with absolutely no knowledge about aperature, iso, shutter speed, etc.

1. This camera is very user friendly. The knobs with explanation on screen is easy to understand. I got some great pics with auto mode and that encouraged me to take more pics.

2. The difference of 9 vs 11 auto focus might be apparent if you have used camera with 11 AF points. For me, 9 was good enough as they are centered in middle of screen. In some occasions where we want to focus on birds, objects near rear of screen, manual focus need to be done. Otherwise AF points are excellent.

3. In built flash is as good as we hope for. For nearby objects, flash is bright and pictures look great. Typewriter pic is taken during night time.

4. Battery is awesome. Canon promised 500 photos. I guess that's enough for normal user. Agreed Nikon gives 1500 pics but I considered availability and cost factor and went for canon. I have been using it everyday from date of purchase and I have charged the battery once a week max. Really it's not like phone battery to charge at end of the day.

5. Picture quality in auto mode is mind blowing. Smartphone all look like toy when using DSLR. With all hype of 64 MP, 108 MP camera in phone, I thought DSLR will just give similar results. Oh boy! I was wrong. Canon portrait pics are many many levels above best smartphone camera pics.

6. I got it with 18-55 mm kit lens. Unless you like to take pics of objects in home and going to use it for taking portrait pics or family outing, this lens is not sufficient to enjoy DSLR. I very strongly urge you to go for 250 mm lens(70-300 mm may be but 250mm is best).

7. Canon image cloud option is very useful. Unfortunately I am not able to upload high quality images-- image size reduces to less than 1 MB during upload. Nevertheless, that option is good.

8. Taking video is pain and it drains battery. This is apt for taking still photos. Also video is restricted to 30 minutes.

9. There are dedicated modes for macro, sports, landscape, food, etc. They just have right settings like higher aperature for landscape etc to get best shot.

10. Learn photos editing software and get one. I thought they were bogus but it turns out you definitely need them.

No need to buy UV lens protection. Get a tripod. Also good memory card. A hood. Good camera bag. You are ready to enter into world of DSLR and definitely canon motivates you to do more."
11825,2.0,"The photo's turned out very well..I know that if the lens is good, it will come out even better. I am very happy to come in such a low budget"
11826,5.0,not so good but I brought it knowing all the pros and cons. Image quality is nice. Autofocus doesnt work well in video. the price should be much lower.
11827,5.0,Its a dream come true for me. Loved the product very much. Packing and the delivery was really great. But didn't get the memory card of 16gb as said in the description. I think it's an edit error on the product page. Amazon offeree a replacement but didn't wanted to go because I suspected even in the replacement I won't get a memory card and also got enough cashbacks to compensate it. Always loved shopping on Amazon. Thank you guys

11832,1.0,"Providing Basic accessories with this package have been curtailed down, which is not an usual scenario. Earlier memory card or bags were included in the package,now without memory card I am unable to check the product quality or use it during festival. I had to order for memory card which would be delivered when festival is over."
11833,5.0,"Let me explain.

Yes, with 9 point AF with the OVF, you'll feel the AF a bit dated but does the job rather well. Live view has face detect but has a jerky continuous AF and is slow.

But those are most of its negatives.

The camera takes wonderful pictures and with digic 4+ image processor, the jpegs are perfectly usable. If you want perfection, shooting in RAW will give you what you need.

The colors captured on this camera are perfect and natural, with settings to tweak them to your taste (see picture settings in menu).

The build quality is solid and ergonomics of the camera, especially through its grip is wonderful. It feels perfect in my hands. The menu system is uncluttered and quite intuitive. It is very easy to customize the camera to your specific needs.

You can shoot videos with this camera but without continuous AF, you'll get better results if you switch to manual focus during video.

Why is it the best DSLR?
Because of it's limitations in AF and simple straightforward usability it lets you take control over your photographs and videos unlike other advanced models which take control away from you and makes the choices for you. The result is you can get the exact photograph you intended to take. Combined with the 24 megapixel sensor, which is the same sensor found in almost all other canon APSC DSLRs, all the way upto 80D, the image quality is at par with much more expensive cameras.

The digic 4+ processor is good for image processing, frankly the more advanced processors bring features such as 4K and such, which if you're not into video, you'll not miss it. The digic 4+ processor is more than adequate for your photography needs.

With all the above considerations, it's the best DSLR you could get, in my opinion."
11834,5.0,"The settings are very easy to learn. I have 18-55mm lens and one might need to go for 55-250mm for even better zoom.

11857,4.0,I must say One of the best compact mirrorles camera under 1 Lakh comes with all features
11858,5.0,"I got this item delivered. There are lot of reviews about this product. So, I will not repeat mostly.

* Good camera for personal use. I not a professional. So I can't comment on that.
* Compact and feels very sturdy.
* Very good autofocus (with fast eye detection).
* Easy to use. I did not read any manual.
* Too many options to explore. I was using an old Sony DSLR. So the menu system was a bit overwhelming.
* Very good quality pictures and videos.
* EVF is good.

It did not come with a charger. But it was good for me as I had few good quality USB type C adapters.

Let me talk about delivery. I was a bit skeptical about the delivery as this is the first time I am ordering an item with this price from an online store.

As usual, the item was well packaged with proper security measures to avoid theft and tampering. Before opening I observed that the box was not in perfect shape. So, I took a video of unboxing to use as evidence if something is wrong inside. But that was not the case. When I removed the external cover, I could see that it came with a bag (surprise...), which was making it as odd shape. But otherwise camera was in a well sealed box. It also had one memory card. The listing did not mention bag and card. So, I got two extra items. A bag and a card."
11859,5.0,"Excellent build quality. Can feel bit heavy with kit lens but not a deal breaker. Menu and settings can overwhelm initially but as u start using the camera and learning more u gain more confidence with manual settings.
Kit lens is pretty good but not the best.
What could improve -
Battery life for photos is decent but club it with video capture; battery drain fast.
Autofocus not upto mark

What’s in the box: (purchased from Appario retail)
Camera + kit lens + 64gb fast write and read memory card + medium size camera bag (probably from seller)"
11860,5.0,"Great quality of pictures! Color, clarity, focus, etc. is amazing. Easy to use. Comes with a bag which is not great. Also mine came with a 64GB SD card. Might feel the need of a bigger lens to capture distant objects or for wild life / nature photography.
I am happy with this buy."
11861,5.0,"IBIS and AF not that good. Most of the pics captured were out of focus. Need to be extra cautious while taking pics. If u don't need flip screen, better to go with XT3. XT3 has weather sealing and great view finder and good screen. Lenses are expensive. Try to buy 16-80 it covers more needs than 18-55. For someone coming from smartphone, there is learning curve. Also be ready to spend lot of money on lens. At least on zoom and one wide angle are needed in addition to kit lens. Picture quality is good, but we need to know how to use it. If you are a casual user/traveller, just go with Iphone 13, which very easy to carry, always with us. Phone is portable, user friendly, everything will be in focus, easy to share pics and save. No need to carry a huge camera bag with charger, camera body, 2 lens, extra memory card, cable to transfer pics. I did 2 trips with this camera, it was hell of experience. Also, we can't take some help from other to click a pic for us, as it needs some expertise. Also, Iphone/any phone covers a lot of focal lengths, this camera is limited to 18mm that too with f2.8, which is not great. f1.4 lens is great for picture quality. They are very expensive.
In short, camera is not required for casual users. Carry lens and changing lens is big issue."
11862,3.0,"I had been looking for a good camera for under Rs 1 lakh for sometime when Fujifilm launched this camera last year and it immediately became a hot favourite of several camera review forums/channels. From a value for money perspective, I think this camera has no competition in the market if you try to find a feature to feature match for this price. From a cost to performance perspective it gets even better. This is a very capable camera. In a few days that I have spent with it, I have found myself pleasantly surprised multiple times by the quality of images that it produces and I am not even talking about the quality of raw files here. I know that relying on SOOC JPEGs may not be a feasible option for a lot of people. However I think if you are so inclined, this is the camera that fits the bill. This is a fairly advanced camera and it is heavily customizable. And although it is very easy to get your photos out of it and into a smartphone, you can't expect the workflow to be the same as a smartphone camera. But then again, the image quality you get is light years ahead of what the best smartphone cameras can do. I bought it without the kit lens and paired it with the cheap xc35mm f2 prime and so far I'm loving it."
11863,2.0,"I personally do not know enough to comment on how good this camera is with respect to the competition, but I've only heard good stuff about it. What I can say is the accessories that came along with it made it possible for me to use it right from the get go. I got a fast and expensive memory care for free, a very nice bag. Grateful for that.
Bought it with the 16-80 and so far I definitely like the camera."
11864,5.0,"Let me admit, I was a little sceptical before buying this masterpiece. After all you are graduating up from DSLR to a mirrorless one and that too requiring a deeper pocket. But then quality comes at a price.
The feel is superb, the grip perfect and overall balanced.
The pictures are sharp, focus is above average. It keeps springing surprises when you try to be adventurous, it never disappoints you. It is always ready whenever you are. The battery drains relatively fast as compared to a DSLR, but a beast of such magnitude would require that much power.
Overall a great package."
11865,5.0,"Picture quality is awsme, auto focus as compare to sony is lightly slow"
11866,5.0,Value for money..
11867,5.0,"Camera just reached, but to my surprise I can't use it as there is no SD Card included. While in the QnA section, multiple times they mentioned that SD card is included. Please reply, why is it not included."
11868,4.0,"I was waiting for this to launch for like quite sometime and I think I got the first camera in North India region. Although not ordered from Amazon but thought of writing review here.

Pros:
Very good image quality and color reproduction, raw images have good details and jpegs are also pleasing.
Good choice in 1 lakh apsc segment as you get ibis and some great kit lens.
Ergonomics also good when compared to other fuji cameras. Handling is on par with sony a6600.

Cons:
Battery life is bit short you need to carry two batteries.
Gets heated a bit.
Fujifilm lenses are expensive and no third party support.
No weather sealing"
11869,4.0,"Prima di questa macchina fotografica avevo una Nikon D5000 con obiettivo 35mm f 1.8, ossia una reflex APS-C CMOS del 2009. Pe quanto possa sembrare scontato che in tutti questi anni ci siano stati enormi miglioramenti, anche la mia vecchia Nikon scattava ottime foto e la qualità dell'immagine in generale è stato l'ultimo punto che mi ha spinto a fare questo passaggio. In questa recensione voglio quindi spiegare cosa cambia e cosa offre questa Fujifilm X-S10 e a chi è rivolta.

PARTE 1: DIFFERENZA generica tra REFLEX e MIRRORLESS:
Mirrorless = senza specchio, ossia senza lo specchio davanti al sensore che nelle reflex manda l'immagine verso l'alto al mirino ottico. A parte questo, proprio come le Reflex, anche le Mirrorles consentono di avere ottiche intercambiabili.

DIMENSIONI: l'assenza dello specchio permette dimensioni ridotte sia del corpo macchina, che delle ottiche. Con l'ottica giusta (tipo il mio FUJINON XF 27 mm f2.8), questa macchina sta tranquillamente nella tasca di un giubbotto o nella taschina degli zaini solitamente riservata a occhiali da sole e altre piccole cose. Sicuramente l'altra ottica che ho scelto, il 16-80, non va affatto in questa direzione essendo una delle più grandi, ma il 18-55 f2.8 che si può scegliere come alternativa è a mio avviso un ottimo compromesso essendo piccolissimo e offrendo una qualità ottica decisamente superiore ai classici 18-55 kit (basti pensare che l'apertura di partenza è f.2.8 e non 3.5). Per farsi un'idea delle dimensioni allego delle foto comparative.

AUTOFOCUS: Poichè il sensore è costantemente attivo (nelle reflex viene attivato solo quando lo specchio si alza quando si scatta la foto) consente un autofocus sia più preciso che più rapido. Ad esempio, questa Fuji riesce a individuare i volti, a regolare l'esposizione in modo ottimale per questi e a mettere a fuoco automaticamente sugli occhi, tutte cose che sulle reflex erano possibili solo in modalità Live View (solo sul display, mentre qui anche sul mirino) e con notevole perdita delle prestazioni (la mia Nikon impiegava addirittura 10 o più secondi a mettere a fuoco in modalità live View e anche lo scatto non era immediato).
Infine, segnalo che questa Fuji riesce a mettere a fuoco anche in condizioni di pessima illuminazione (addirittura -6 stop) e in generale è molto molto più rapida a mettere a fuoco.

ANTEPRIMA ESPOSIZONE: Sempre per il motivo che il sensore è sempre attivo, è possibile visualizzare direttamente sul display o sul mirino un'anteprima dell'esposizione dell'immagine sulla base dei parametri impostati. Ciò era possibile anche su alcune reflex (non sulla mia) ma, come per l'autofocus sui volti, solo in modalità live View con tutte le conseguenze già dette al punto precedente. Senza di ciò ci si doveva basare solo sulle indicazioni dell'esposimetro (la lineetta con i + e i - in basso), il che ovviamente si riferiva solo a un singolo punto dell'immagine e non consentiva di farsi un'idea su tutto il resto della foto (si doveva andare a tentativi). Così l'esperienza è simile a quella che si ha con uno smartphone.

MIRINO OLED: per quanto l'immagine che si apprezza nelle reflex direttamente riflessa dallo specchio sia stata a lungo considerata superiore, la qualità dei mirini OLED attuali non fa rimpiangere ed anzi segna un altro puto a favore delle mirrorless (e di questa Fuji): non solo la qualità è ottima, grazia sia all'altissima risoluzione dello schermino del mirino sia al fatto che sia oled e che quindi abbia contrasti perfetti con neri assoluti (e non grigi), ma anche è possibile apprezzare sul mirino funzioni altrimenti relegate solo al display (come l'anteprima dell'esposizione, del bilanciamento del bianco, del profilo colore, dell'HDR e altro).

CONTRO: Batteria. sicuramente il fatto che sensore e display/mirino siano sempre accesi comporta dei consumi molto maggiori. Con la mia reflex non avevo mai sentito la necessità di una seconda batteria, mentre con questa può essere necessario se si prospetta di dover scattare molte foto (per viaggi o giornate normali invece si arriva tranquillamente a sera con carica residua). Comodo a tal proposito che la ricarica avvenga (anche) via USB-C (senza dover rimuovere la batteria), con lo stesso caricabatterie del cellulare (una cosa in meno da portarsi in viaggio) e che si possa ricaricare anche con una powerbank e usarla contemporaneamente (utile se ad esempio non si dispone di una seconda batteria).

PARTE 2: DIFFERENZA GENERICA TRA APS-C E FULL-FRAME O MICRO 4:3
DIMENSIONI: Anche in questo caso, a parità di tipologia (mirrroless), le APS-C sono più piccole delle FULL-Frame sia per quanto riguarda il corpo macchina che le ottiche. In generale le ritengo un giusto compromesso tra full-frame (sensore più grande, dimensioni maggiori) e micro 4:3 (sensore più piccolo e dimensioni ancora inferiori).

OTTICHE: Le ottiche APS-C sono generalmente più piccole e molto meno costose, tuttavia, è opportuno ricordare che la quantità di sfocato che viene generato da aperture molto luminose è ridotta e va convertita con un indice di 1:1,5. Mi spiego meglio, il livello di sfocato che si otterrà con un’ottica APS-C f. 1.8 è lo stesso che si otterrebbe con un’ottica per full-frame di focale equivalente f. 1.8 x 1,5 = 2,7 ≈ f 2.8, quindi per il processo inverso se si vuole ottenere uno sfocato (bokeh) pari a un 2.8 full frame, su una fotocamera APS-C si deve optare per un obiettivo f. 1.8. Ad ogni modo, l’APS-C è il giusto mezzo tra full frame e macchine fotografiche con sensori più piccoli (in cui questo discorso è ancora più accentuato).
Infine ricordo che per calcolare la focale full frame equivalente anche in questo caso si deve moltiplicare per 1.5 (quindi un’ottica APS-C 35mm è all’incirca pari a un 50 mm full frame come angolo di campo dell’inquadratura).

COSTO: a parità di caratteristiche, le APS-C costano in genere anche 1000 o più euro in meno di una full frame. Infatti, per comprare una Full frame completa di tutte le caratteristiche che questa Fuji X-S10 offre si devono scomodare modelli professionali da 2-3.000€, senza contare il costo delle ottiche, molto maggiore per le full frame. Lo ripeto ancora una volta, le APS-C mi sembrano il giusto compromesso tra costo e qualità offerta.

ISO / LUCE: va detto che un sensore più piccolo significa necessariamente meno luce che entra. Tuttavia, questa macchina fotografica regge davvero davvero bene gli iso anche alti, il che insieme alla stabilizzazione su sensore (che permette di alzare i tempi di esposizione anche a mano libera) permette di compensare senza grossi problemi la minore luce che entra. Anche quando gli iso si fanno davvero alti, la grana che si aggiunge è piacevole rispetto ad altre macchine e, poichè si hanno a disposizione 26 MP, alla fine dà poco fastidio.

PARTE 3: PERCHE' proprio FUJIFILM?
SENSORE APS-C XTRANS: Mentre Sony, Nikon, Canon, etc... si concentravano sulle mirrorless full-frame, Fujifilm ha lanciato già da molti anni le sue mirorrless e SOLO nel formato APS-C, dedicando quindi molta più attenzione delle altre già citate case, che hanno rilasciato le loro prime mirrorless APS-C solo di recente.
Inoltre, a differenza dei sensori di praticamente qualsiasi altra macchina fotografica, che sfruttano lo schema Bayer, i sensori Fujifilm proprietari sfruttano un loro schema XTRANS. Questo oltre ad avere rilevanza da un punto di vista della rappresentazione dei colori (vedi dopo), elimina la necessità di avere un filtro passa basso, che nei sensori con schemi Bayer è invece necessario perché previene la formazione di artefatti ma che di fatto riduce la nitidezza delle immagini. Preciso infine anche qui che questo sensore (retroilluminato) regge benissimo gli iso e permette foto ottime anche con poca luce.

STABILIZZAZIONE a livello di SENSORE: oltre alla stabilizzazione ottica presente su numerose ottiche, questa piccola Fuji (già perché di solito è presente in fotocamere più grandi e costose) presenta al suo interno una stabilizzazione anche a livello di sensore.
Nelle ottiche in cui è già presente una stabilizzazione, questo ulteriore stabilizzatore si somma e migliora ulteriormente la capacità di annullare le vibrazioni. Nelle ottiche in cui non lo è inoltre offre un vantaggio ancora più notevole.
Rispetto alla singola stabilizzazione ottica presente sugli obiettivi, comunque, questo genere di stabilizzazione è più rapida e precisa e consente di “guadagnare” fino a 6 stop, che non sono affatto pochi; questo significa che si possono usare tempi di posa a mano libera fino a 6 volte maggiori senza che le foto vengano mosse, un gran vantaggio che ho avuto modo di apprezzare in questi mesi.

COLORI: caratteristica peculiare ormai rinomata di Fujifilm. Non solo la resa dei colori è in generale ottima, ma questa macchina fotografica permette di scegliere tra di preset chiamati “simulazione pellicola” che davvero rappresentano un bel valore aggiunto. I miei preferiti sono “classic Chrome”, che dà un aspetto leggermente vintage davvero bello, “astia”, molto morbido e tenue, perfetto peri i ritratti (vedi foto del gatto e del cane), “velvia”, molto saturo, ideale per i paesaggi e la natura (vedi foto delle case sul Ticino e del fiume in mezzo alla gola) e lo standard “provia” (vedi Matera in notturna); belli anche “eterna”, che ha dato un look molto cinematografico ai miei scatti a Matera e “classic negative”, che riproduce i colori delle classiche foto fatte a rullino (vedi foto con ragazza e bambino sugli scogli). Bellissimo b/n con “acros” infine.
Grazie a questa eccellente elaborazione dei JPEG e a questi profili colore (che possono anche essere personalizzati a proprio piacimento), questa Fuji elabora dei JPEG praticamente già pronti, caratteristica non da poco che consente di non dover trascorrere ore ed ore ad elaborare i file raw come sarebbe necessario fare con altre macchine fotografiche.

INTERFACCIA UTENTE: rispetto ad altre macchine (in particolare le Sony), i menù sono ben organizzati. Inoltre sono presenti numerosi controlli virtuali, tasti fisici e ghiere, tutti personalizzabili in base alle proprie esigenze e preferenze, e in generale l’ergonomia di questa macchina fotografica è ottima, sia da un punto di vista di tenerla in mano (altre Fuji peccavano in questo a favore di un aspetto più retò) sia in termini di controlli. Rispetto ad altre Fuji (X-T30, X-T4) ha perso la possibilità di premere le ghiere per fare switch tra le varie funzioni assegnate, ma non ne ho mai vista l’esigenza in quanto i nuovi controlli PASM (senza ghiera dei tempI) sono ben organizzate e tutti i controlli sono sempre a portata di mano. Ho prezzato tantissimo la presenza di una ghiera dedicata alla compensazione dell’esposizione, cosa ormai presente in tutte le fotocamere ma che la mia vecchia Nikon non aveva e mi costringeva a muovermi tra mille controlli per regolare una funzione così fondamentale.
Utile poi la presenza del menù Q, dove si possono scegliere fino a 16 impostazioni da avere a portata di mano, e il fatto che i controlli assegnati a ghiere e pulsanti possano essere regolati osservando il cambiamento in diretta mentre ci si muove tra le varie opzioni perché non ostruiscono lo schermo (utile per il bilanciamento del bianco e per la simulazione pellicola sopratutto).

ESTETICA: per quanto meno retrò rispetto ad altri modelli della casa per via dell’assenza della ghiera dei tempi, anche lei conserva un aspetto decisamente retrò quando abbinata ad obiettivi quali il mio 27mm f2.8, mentre al contrario appare decisamente professionale e più moderna quando abbinata al 16-80 f4.0. Personalmente, da un punto di vista estetico non mi piaceva in foto quando paragonata ad esempio alla X-T30, anche per via della presenza di un’unica colorazione (non è disponibile il caratteristico bicolore argento o argento scuro); mi sono però ricreduto dal vivo, in quanto appare decisamente più bella. Ricordo che il materiale è metallico, anzichè plastico, del corpo proprio come degli obiettivi (serie XF, mentre gli XC sono in plastica).

COSTO: Obiettivamente la migliore da un punto di vista qualità prezzo; la sua concorrente, la Sony alpha 6600, ossia un’altra mirrorless con sensore APS-C stabilizzato e caratteristiche simili (per quanto in vari aspetti inferiori) costa sui 500€ in più. In generale una differenza di prezzo così ampia non si apprezza sul resto della gamma Fujifilm.

OTTICHE: le ottiche Fuji sono di ottima qualità e sicuramente non ne rimarrete delusi (come non ne sono rimaso deluso io). In generale consiglio uno zoom variabile tra il 18-55 f.2.8 e il 16-80 f.4, a seconda del budget, e un fisso sui 35mm quale ad esempio il Fuji XC 35mm f2.0 che vale assolutamente i 200€ che costa ed è tutto sommato compatto. Se non avete mai usato ottiche fisse (e in generqale un 35mm APSC, ossia un 50 mm equivalente) in passato vi consiglio caldamente di provare: per quanto all’invio possa sembrare scomodo non poter variare focale e soprattutto questa focale (50mm equivalente), appena prenderete l’abitudine le vostre foto raggiungeranno un livello totalmente nuovo. Infine, molto compatto, ottimo otticamente e dall’aspetto retrò il 27 mm f2.8 che vedete in foto. Fujifilm ha aperto ad ottiche di terze parti solo da poco, quindi in generale non ce ne sono molte (segnalo a tal proposito le Viltrox) ma al gamma Fujifilm è davvero completa e il fatto che, come dicevo prima, Fuji si sia concentrata primariamente sulle APS-C (e non sulle full frame, come altre case) fa si che ci siano obiettivi per tutte le necessita (e portafogli).

PARTE 4: ALTRO
DISPLAY: per quanto sia spesso sottovalutato, mi sono reso conto con la mia vecchia Nikon (che aveva un pessimo display in quanto risoluzione) quanto importante possa essere il display di una fotocamera; infatti, diventa difficile rendersi conto se una foto è venuta bene o male con un display scarso, non accorgendosi persino se una foto è fuori fuoco o meno. La risoluzione del display di questa Fuji, con i suoi 1,04 milioni di pixel, si colloca al di sopra di molte mirrorless fullframe (tipo Sony Alpha 7 III e la concorrenza APS-C di Nikon e Canon, che ne hanno in genere sui 900 mila), per quanto non sia ai vertici (la sorella XT-4 e la XT-30 Mark II ne hanno 1.6 milioni). Ad ogni modo, questo display è ottimo per risoluzione, resa cromatica e angolo di visuale, ed è pure orientabile (il che è utile in molte situazioni). Personalmente, data la mia brutta esperienza di questi anni con il display della Nikon, mi ero imposto di non comprare nessuna nuova fotocamera con display con meno di 1 milione di punti.

DIMENSIONI FILE, FORMATI: È possibile scattare sia in RAW che in JPEG che in entrambi allo stesso tempo. Inoltre è possibile scegliere se si preferiscono RAW compressi o non e se si preferisce una compressione senza perdita o maggiore (i RAW compressi non sono supportati da molti software e necessitano preferibilmente di Capture One, quello fornito in dotazione, ma consumano meno spazio). Il Mac e l'iPhone sono compatibili nativamente con i Raw di questa X-S10 solo se non compressi, altrimenti consiglio di usare Capture One oppure RAW Power, che da un po' supporta anche i file compressi, supporta i profili colore delle simulazioni pellicola ufficiali ed è disponibile come acquisto una tantum (non abbonamento come Lightroom o photoshop) sia per Mac (39€) sia per iPhone/iPad (10€).
Un file JPEG alla massima risoluzione occupa sui 12-15 MB, mentre per un RAW passiamo a circa 50MB a foto.

MANUALE: ho apprezzato il manuale (in italiano), disponibile in formato digitale sia pdf sia interattivo, in quanto davvero completo. Inoltre, Fujifilm rilascia piccole integrazioni per le funzioni aggiunte con gli aggiornamenti firmware successivi alla pubblicazione del manuale pdf. Il cartaceo non è presente, ma non lo rimpiango in quanto la versione interattiva può essere consultata dal cellulare in ogni momento e in modo più agevole.

FLASH INTEGRATO: piccolo, ma utile in alcune circostanze. Rispetto a quello che avevo nella mia Nikon è più esile, ma è comunque efficace in alcune situazioni (per quanto non ami la fotografia con flash).

ACCESSORI CONSIGLIATI: Io ho comprato il caro, ma utile, kit di Peak Design per convertire la tracolla inclusa (in pelle, nera, carina) e poterla staccare quando voglio usare la maniglia (sempre Peak Design, visibile in foto) o non voglio niente attaccato (utile se voglio ridurre al minimo l'ingombro). Si trovano entrambi su amazon, ma vi consiglio di guardare anche sul sito di Peak Design perché nel mio caso il prezzo pure includendo le spese di spedizione era inferiore. Inoltre consiglio un proteggi schermo qualsiasi in vetro fatto apposta per Fuji X-S10 (per quanto il display possa essere chiuso e protetto talvolta è utile lasciato aperto e graffiarlo sarebbe un peccato). Io uso poi un lettore di schede SD per il cellulare (iPhone, nel mio caso) per passare le foto en plein d'air perché l'app è davvero lenta, mentre cosi in qualche secondo si passano centinaia di foto. Consiglio infine il treppiedi piccolo e portatile JOBY GorillaPod 1K.

APP/GEOTAG FOTO: per quanto l'applicazione sia recensita molto male e il passaggio delle foto al cellulare sia piuttosto lento e in generale scomodo, volevo la presenza di un’interfaccia con il cellulare principalmente per assegnare la posizione alle alle foto (geotag), proprio come avviene quando scatto una foto con il cellulare, e questo avviene piuttosto bene con l’app. Con il mio nuovo iPhone 13 Pro la fotocamera si collega ed apre l'app in background per ottenere la posizione automaticamente, anche se l'app non viene aperta da molto tempo. Con il mio vecchio iPhone, o in generale nel caso in cui non dovesse collegarsi alla fotocamera in automatico, basterà aprire l'app sul cellulare a inizio giornata e poi il processo funziona tranquillamente senza problemi. Non ho notato rilevanti consumi di batteria sul cellulare e comodo che sincronizzi anche l'orario per averlo sempre preciso. In generale la fotocamera non chiede la posizione al cellulare per ogni foto, ma solo ogni tot di tempo.

Spero di aver chiarito ogni possibile dubbio e che questa recensione vi sia stata utile!"
11870,4.0,
11871,4.0,"This is my first Fujifilm camera (ever!) as I've always been a Canon-man (and Panasonic if I go back far enough). When I saw the press-release of this X-S10 and read a few of the initial reviews, I was pretty sure I had found my new camera and camera system.

While my Canon DSLR was good - it was starting to show its age and I reached a point in my photography where I felt that I ""needed"" something different to improve and inspire me to get back out there and click that shutter. I travel a lot (or used to pre-COVID but will hopefully start again next year) so I liked the idea of a more compact mirrorless camera. Aside from travel photography my main interests are usually wildlife and cityscape/street so again a less obvious camera/lens setup would be helpful. I had never really considered a Fujifilm before the X-S10 as all those dials on top and endless buttons and labels on different models seemed confusing and a bit over the top. Sorry to all Fujifilm lovers who adore those things, just for me it stopped my making the leap before now. I imagine this new camera will divide users on whether or not this is a ""proper"" Fujifilm because of the different approach to design and button layout, but it was enough to make me jump ship so it might bring others to the Fujifilm family.

From out the box, using and becoming familiar with the S10 was a bit difficult. I have no point of comparison from older Fujifilm models to this one (as I mentioned its my first) but it is definitely very different from Canon. The menu system is more complex, with a lot more options and pages upon pages to get to grips with. There is nothing wrong with this - I doubt that previous FF users will have any difficultly but there will be a bit of a learning curve for others. I was glad the PSAM dial was there to help me out (used AUTO for a while to get to grips with the camera. I was pleased to find the four custom options as well as the customisable left and right dial (for the moment I've left them as default). While I didn't like it at first, I have found after a week that the ""joystick"" to navigate the screen is better than a D-pad (which I was used to) and is very responsive.

Build quality is high as you would expect at this price point and I was surprised with both the display quality of the eye piece and from the LCD screen. The layout of the screen is good but I would recommend you go into settings and somewhere (as I can't remember where) there is a option to increase the size of the icons and information displays on the screen (which was helpful). The camera is compact (owing to the system) but fits in the hand well. It does feel just a bit smaller than it should be (if that makes sense) but I imagine I will get used to it. The grip on the right is deep and the perfect size to be comfortable to hold and operate the camera for long periods.

I have a few issues with the design, I don't know how common they are to FF cameras. Firstly I found it strange to have the SD card slot in the same compartment as the battery. I don't know why but it just ""annoys"" me a bit, I suppose because I am used to having separate compartments. I have no problem with a single card SD slot but I was a bit disappointed to find it only supports UHS-1 memory cards. I have had other cheaper models that supported the faster cards. Personally I have not found (yet) that it affects photography or video in any negative way (even 4K records perfectly) so you could argue that its not needed. One thing that WAS a problem and will take a lot to get used to is that small on/off switch. Is it just me or is that really small? It's also not the easiest to turn on and off especially if you have large (or cold) fingers.

I was worried about what I had heard about the ""poor battery life"" from reading about the camera elsewhere, however I would say battery life is reasonable. They don't last as long as my previous canon's but considering they are smaller I would say it was a reasonable trade-off. Bottom line is that you are going to need at least one spare if you plan on being out all day or doing something shutter intensive (such as a wedding) but you are not going to need the ""loads"" that some reviewers have suggested elsewhere. An great advantage is that the battery can be charged in camera via a USB-C cable. You can charge your battery from a laptop, a power-bank or by plugging the cable into a USB-A plug. The camera does not come with a external charger as such, I believe that is the right choice to keeps things light and compact, but if you want to charge your batteries from the mains (or plan on buying multiple) then you can buy a charger easily (and cheaply) enough. For your reference I spent a day (and most of the night) shooting in Edinburgh zoo and the city centre - exhausted one battery and didn't take much out the second (less than half). Plus it was pretty cool being able to connect it to my power bank to charge on the go.

I have been extremely happy with the image quality even straight from the memory card. I'm using the XF18-55mm F2.8-4 R LM and the XF55-200mm F3.5-4.8 R LM - they are both stunning! While they may seem a bit expensive (considering a 50-200mmm lens is available for half the cost) they are really worth the money. Eventually I will get a Prime or two but at the moment my credit card is full enough. I've enclosed a few examples of the quality achieved out-of-camera from Edinburgh Zoo (still working on my city-centre images). Overall I have been pleased with what I have been able to achieve in a short time, I'm a sure more seasoned FF users would have even more luck.

This model has in body stabilization which is a welcome addition under the one-thousand pound mark. So far I feel it works very well and is very close in operation in comparison to more expensive models.

I've taken a few videos (shutting in 4K at 29.9fps and 200Mb frame-rate) and have been happy with the results. I'm not a massive vlogger or video-shooter but there are plenty of video options (pages and pages) to keep you happy.

The cost of this camera seems about right, personally I would have loved it to be a bit cheaper but I'm sure most of us can say that about most things. For the price you get great build quality and brilliant images with plenty of options and settings to play with. I also have to conclude that the Fujifilm lens system (and options) are much better than what I have had in the past.

If I was asked to review this six months down the line when I've had a lot more experience I maybe more inclined to award 5-stars. For the moment I feel there are a few ""strange"" design quirks such as the small on/off switch, the same memory/battery compartment, lack of UHS-II+ cards and so forth. All of which just makes it fall a tiny bit short. Don't get me wrong, this is still a brilliant camera that is very capable. I hope it appeals to both current FF users and people like me who jumped-ship.

The S10 is a better camera with better lenses than my canon set-up. The cost of this camera and my two lenses works out at about three hundred pound more expensive than my canon and twin lens kit set up was. For what you are getting in return from the S10, that's not bad at all. For me I look forward to getting to use it more (more importantly learning to use it more) and getting back to travelling with a more compact system."
11872,3.0,"Le recensioni non le rendono giustizia. Dico solo che è la mia quarta macchina fotografica e l ho amata da subito. Con le lenti giuste non ha nulla da invidiare all ammiraglia, sua sorella maggiore.
Ergonomia perfetta soprattutto per che sono una donna e ho le mani sottili uno dei motivi per cui ho abbandonato le reflex e ho scelto le mirrorless.
Assolutamente consigliata."
11873,4.0,
11874,5.0,"Dopo averne provate e viste davvero molte mi sono fermato su questo gioellino perchè seppur con qualche compromesso ha davvero tutto quello che si può desiderare da una fotocamera di buon livello.

I prerequisiti erano:
- Obiettivi intercambiabili
- Dimensioni contenute
- stabilizzatore (vi diranno che non serve, che è una cavolata, che ci vuole la mano, che bisogna impostare n-mila settaggi e che se le foto vengono mosse è solo colpa vostra, il che al 90% è vero) averlo è una goduria, anche se pochi gli stop che si guadagno almeno per me sono veramente comodi, e i video sono fantastici, avendo un obbiettivo anch'esso stabilizzato si riescono a fare davvero cose molto interessanti.
- display orientabile/estraibili, che a molti non piace perchè disallinea l'asse obiettivo con quello del mirino, ma a me piace tantissimo. E soprattutto può essere girato a 180° in modo da nascondere e proteggere l'lcd e dando al contempo un look retro che mi piace moltissimo.
- flash, avevo provato la X-E4, anch'essa ottima, ma il flash per quanto piccolo o riduttivo sia, credo sia un qualcosa che non deve mancare.

E la X-S10 ha tutte queste caratteristiche. Ero un po' preoccupato dall'ingombro dell'impugnatura, che mi sembrava troppo pronunciata ma credetemi ora la considero un assoluto punto di forza. Poter impugnare la macchina solo da lì è fantastico.

Detto questo le foto sono come per la altre fuji di fascia X belle e pulite, i filtri delle fuji per le jpg inutile dirlo danno subito risalto alle foto. I 26mp forse un pelino pochi, ma quello che fa la differenza alla fine è la lente che ci montate e l'occhio che avete che anche un non professionista come me può ottenere degli scatti assolutamente soddisfacenti.

Difetti, se così vogliamo chiamarli, possono essere la messa a fuoco che a volte presenta un po' di titubanze, ma risolvibili con qualche correzione, e la connessione al pc, soprattutto in modalità wifi che necessita di un po' di lavoro extra.

Ci sarebbe altro da dire e magari aggiornerò la recensione, per ora la trovo ottima, bella da usare e con una sensazione molto piacevole nel tenerla in mano. Super consigliata."
11875,5.0,
11876,5.0,"Ich habe eine X-T4 und diese Kamera ist für mich perfekt. da stimmt einfach alles. Nun habe ich meine H1 verkauft und mir die X-S10 zugelegt, weil sie von wichtigsten Parametern, die man zum Fotografieren braucht der T4 durchaus gewachsen ist. Was den ganzen Rest betrifft, kann sie der aber nicht das Wasser reichen.
wie gesagt hat sie den AF von der T4, die Bildqualität und auch den Sensor.

Ist sie etwas für den Umsteiger von einem anderen Systems?

Ja, weil es eine spitzenmäßige Kamera ist und Nein !, weil man sich damit genauso beschäftigen muss, wie mit jeder anderen Kamera, um sie bedienen zu können. Ein Wahlrad von S, A, M ist zwar neu bei Fuji reicht aber nicht, um damit reibungslos zu arbeiten. Für den Fuji Nutzer wird das Ganze schon etwas einfacher, weil das Menü nahezu identisch ist im Verhältnis zu anderen Fuji Kameras.
Wie gesagt: Man bekommt eine Spitzen Kamera zum Spitzen Preis und damit muss man sich beschäftigen, um alles aus ihr herauszuholen.

Reicht der alte Akku oder wäre ein neuer besser gewesen?

Für meine Verhältnisse reicht der Akku und schön ist, dass man bei allen Fujis diesen Akku verwenden kann, außer bei der T4.
Der Akku reicht bei mir für 300-400 Bilder und die zwei Sekunden um ihn zu wechseln, kann man ja immer haben.
Ein Zweitakku ist aber Pflicht, wie bei jeder anderen Kamera auch. ich nutze die von Patona und bin damit sehr zufrieden. (kosten um die 10 Euro)

Macht es viel aus, wenn die Kamera nicht wie die T4 wetterfest ist?

Eigentlich nicht und es gibt für alle die gern im strömenden Regen fotografieren geeignete Raincover von zig Anbietern, im Notfall tut es auch einmal eine Plastiktüte. Die T4 ist zwar wetterfest, aber kostet auch 800 Euro mehr. Wer also aus vielen anderen Gründen lieber eine X-S10 möchte, sollte dieses Kriterium nicht berücksichtigen.

Die berühmten Customeinstellungen C1 bis C4, sind sie hilfreich?

Mit den C1 bis C4 Einstellungen, die man über das Wahlrad oben ansteuern kann, hat man die Möglichkeit sich für bestimmte Aufnahmesituationen Voreinstellungen zu konfigurieren.
Beispiel: Ich will ein Portrait machen lege diese Einstellung auf C1... jetzt kann ich für diese Art Foto alles vorher festlegen, von der AF Art, über Kontraste, Weißabgleich, Filmsimulation usw... bis in die absolute Tiefe des Menüs.
Steht ein Portrait an, dann stelle ich auf C1 und fertig. Schön wär 's.
Ich habe die Erfahrung gemacht, dass einem (besser gesagt mir) dieser Kram eigentlich gar nichts nützt, weil es erstens meist nicht hinhaut und man zweitens nicht mehr weiß, was man da alles so konfiguriert hat. Man müsste sich das ja auch noch für die anderen 3 Voreinstellungen merken.
Meine Variante ist die: ich habe eine Kamera, wo ich mein Bild vorher sehe. ich konfiguriere mir meine X-S10 und die Knöpfe und Räder so, dass ich alles erreiche ohne in das Menü zu müssen und bin so schneller. Außerdem kann ich so für aktuelle Aufnahmesituation immer die passenden Parameter wählen.
Für spezielle Aufgaben wie Infrarot oder Sterne macht es dagegen vielleicht Sinn.

Lässt sich die X-S10 besser bedienen als die X-T4?

Für mich nicht, aber man kann sich damit arrangieren. bei der T4 habe ich alle fotorelevanten Einstellungen direkt an der Kamera, dazu sind die Räder auch beschriftet, der AF kann mittels Hebel unten verändert werden usw.
Für mich ist das die klassische Bedienung, weshalb ich mir Fujis zugelegt habe.
Trotzdem kann man sich viele Dinge auch an der S10 dahin legen, wo man sie braucht und nach ein bisschen Zeit, weiß man wo die liegen und kann die Kamera auch reibungslos bedienen.

Ist der IBIS sinnvoll?

Ja er ist in meinen Augen mehr als sinnvoll, weil er alle angesetzten Objektive stabilisiert, egal ob sie einen OIS haben oder nicht. Außerdem sorgt er für ein ruhiges Sucherbild bei langen Brennweiten und für ruhige Freihand -Videos. Ich finde es gar nicht so relevant, ob ich jetzt ein Bild 2s belichten kann, ohne zu verwackeln, aber gerade in den Grenzbereichen so um 1/30s macht man eine Vielzahl an schärferen Bilder, als wenn man keinen hätte. Mit dieser zeit gehen auch noch Portraits bei wenig Licht usw.

Ist die X-S10 gut verarbeitet?

Ja, sehr gut, obwohl sie kompakt und leicht ist. Trotzdem lässt sie sich auch gern in größere Hände nehmen, fasst sich wertig an und macht wie alle Fujis einen soliden Eindruck.

Gibt es etwas zu bemängeln?

Ja, eine spärliche deutsche Anleitung und das fehlende Ladegerät. Nachdem bei der T4 ja wenigstens noch ein Stecker dabei ist, ist es jetzt nur noch ein Kabel. Gut ist, dass es relativ preiswerte Ladegeräte gibt, die man hier kaufen kann.

Fazit: die X-s10 ist eine sehr gute Kamera, mit man alle fotografischen Aufgaben perfekt lösen kann. In Allianz mit perfekten Fuji Objektiven, die fast alle auf höchstem Niveau sind, macht das sehr viel Freude. Die Kamera lässt eigentlich nichts vermissen, ist schnell, kompakt, hat eine außerordentliche Bildqualität und stellt auch bei wenig Licht zuverlässig scharf. Man muss sich mit ihr beschäftigen, um ihre Fähigkeiten auszureizen, aber das ist bei anderen Kameras genauso. Mir als Fuji Fan gefällt zwar das Konzept nicht sonderlich gut, aber das muss jeder für sich entscheiden. Wenn Geld und ein bisschen mehr Gewicht keine Rolle spielt, dann würde ich mir die X-T4 auf alle Fälle mal ansehen. Für meine Verhältnisse ist das die beste Fuji Kamera.
Eine Empfehlung ist die X-S10 auf alle Fälle und auch eine der besten Kameras auf dem Markt in diesem Sektor und zu diesem Preis."
11877,5.0,
11878,2.0,"Es gibt so viele (Test-) Berichte und Vergleiche über und mit dieser Kamera. Eine weitere Spec-Schlacht ergibt da einfach keinen Sinn und würde keine echte Einschätzung zulassen, wie sich die Kamera im Alltag tatsächlich schlägt. Daher die aus meiner Sicht wichtigsten Punkte, die man über die X-S10 wissen sollte.

Handhabung:
Die Kamera ist angenehm kompakt, erst recht mit diesem Objektiv (XF 18-55mm 2.8-4.0 R LM OIS). Sie liegt durch ihren tiefen Handgriff sehr gut in der Hand. Man kann die Kamera mit dem Griff auch locker längere Zeit in der Hand halten, wenn man sie nicht mit dem Tragegurt trägt. Mit vergleichbaren Kameras anderer Hersteller taten mir so irgendwann die Finger weh.

Apropos Gurt: der ist angenehm schmal und sehr dezent. Nur ein kleiner weißer Schriftzug weißt im unteren (!) Teil des Gurtes auf die Marke hin. Also keine übertriebene Zurschaustellung der Marke. Top!

Bildqualität:
Ein erheblicher Mehrwert der X-S10 ggü. den Konkurrenten ist die Qualität der JPEGs. Die Kamera bietet die Möglichkeit, mit Filmsimulationen (im Prinzip sind das Farbprofile) sehr brauchbare JPEGs direkt aus der Kamera zu generieren. Natürlich muss man ein wenig Ausprobieren und Testen. Jeder Anwender einer Systemkamera steht aber nunmal vor der Frage: JPEG oder RAW? Ja, es geht auch beides, aber darum geht’s hier nicht. RAWs brauchen zu 99% Nacharbeit und sind zudem sehr groß. Die Nacharbeit kostet vor allem Zeit und Geld (z.B. für Lightroom). Hat man hingegen ein Gefühl für die JPEG-Möglichkeiten der Fuji bekommen, kann man einfach und schnell die Bilder nutzen und genießen (ohne, dass sie wochenlang auf Bearbeitung warten). Wer es besonders eilig hat kann schon auf dem Heimweg die Bilder per App aufs Smartphone übertragen und sofort bei Instagram posten. ;-) Übrigens bieten fast alle anderen Fujifilm-Kameras ebenfalls die Filmsimulationen und damit auch brauchbare JPEGs.

Unterstützt wird das Ganze durch einen wirklich sehr guten und rauscharmen Sensor, der zusätzlich auch noch stabilisiert ist (IBIS). Nur wenige Kameras bieten in diesem Preissegment eine vergleichbare Funktion. Verwendet man zusätzlich noch eines der stabilisierten OIS-Objektive von Fuji, kann man richtig gute Aufnahmen in dunklen Umgebungen aus der Hand (!) machen. Echt stark!

Bedienung:
Die X-S10 ist nicht die einfachste Kamera, keine Frage. Aber sie erschlägt den Nutzer auch nicht mit einer endlosen Liste an Funktionen. Die Bedienung erfordert etwas Einarbeitung. Hat man seine Konfiguration vorgenommen, geht das Fotografieren aber leicht und schnell von der Hand. Helfen tut dabei auch der praktische Blendenring an den Fuji-XF-Objektiven.

Objektiv:
Das Objektiv XF 18-55mm 2.8-4.0 R LM OIS ist eine sehr gute Allround-Ergänzung. Es ist optisch stabilisiert und besticht vor allem durch seine Größe und Verarbeitung. Im Prinzip ist es ein besseres Zoom-Objektiv ggü. der XC-Serie und sollte gewöhnlichen Ansprüchen mehr als genügen. Die Kamera passt damit sogar in eine größere Jackentasche. ;-) Für optische Besonderheiten (z.B. höhere Lichtstärke oder Sonnensterne) sollte man auf das etwas größere, aber auch teurere XF16-80mmF4 R OIS WR zurückgreifen, das es ebenfalls im Kit mit der X-S10 gibt.

Ein wesentlicher Kaufgrund für die X-S10 waren tatsächlich die Objektive, im Speziellen die von Fujifilm selbst. Im Verhältnis zu Canon oder Nikon gibt es auf dem Markt zwar deutlich weniger Fuji-Objektive von Drittanbietern (wie z.B. von Tamron), weniger ist hier allerdings nicht schlechter. Die Objektive von Fuji sind sehr gut, vor allem die XF-Serie. Für jeden Einsatzzweck gibt es mindestens ein Objektiv im mittleren Preissegment.

Fazit:
Die Kamera ist perfekt für Familien und Leute, die mit Systemkameras auf Tuchfühlung gehen wollen. Technisch lässt die X-S10 kaum Wünsche offen und bietet wirklich viel fürs Geld. Sie ist kompakt, wertig, durchdacht und bereitet (nach etwas Einarbeitung) richtig Freude am Fotografieren. Die JPEG-Fähigkeiten erlauben den schnellen Genuss der Bilder.

Fujifilm bietet zudem hochwertige Objektive. In jedem Fall rate ich zu einem XF-Objektiv, mag der Preis im ersten Moment auch hoch sein - es lohnt sich. Sehr empfehlenswert!"
11879,5.0,
11880,4.0,Present for my son......who tells me it's great
11881,1.0,"I bought this as an upgrade to my X-T30. Initially I was put off by the different controls from the traditional Fuji cameras, but having used it a few weeks now I actually find it easier to setup the camera to exactly how I want it. I mainly shoot in aperture priority and set up the C4 custom dial as my main profile as this is next to the video on the PASM dial, one click of the dial is a lot more convenient than turning half way round the dial.

In terms of image quality it is pretty much identical to the X-T30, that is, it’s excellent and has the same Fuji colours. The X-S10 does have one extra film simulation mode, Eterna bleach bypass, not something I’ve used, but I guess its still one more than the X-T30. What is useful over the X-T30 is that the film simulation menu now gives you more details about the film simulation and its intended use. These film simulations can also be applied to video which it can record in 4k/dci up to 30fps and 10x slow motion at 240fps in 1080p. Where the X-T30 had a record limit of only 10 minutes in 4k video, the X-S10 can record the industry standard 30 minutes of 4k.

Build quality is solid and feels better built than the X-T30 which was already pretty good. The handling is also so much better with the larger grip, something which the X-T30 was lacking even when fitted with a grip/L bracket. The X-S10 feels so much better in the hand and makes for easier one handed operation even with a heavier/larger lens. The touchscreen is the same size as the X-T30 but as it is also a flips out it makes it more versatile especially for low angle shots or for selfie/vlogging.

If vlogging or video shooting is what you do a lot the the 5-axis in body image stabilisation when paired with a lens with optical image stabilisation makes for a very smooth stabilised video. This can be further enhanced with the digital stabilisation function in camera though it will slightly crop the image when doing so. All the prime lenses for Fuji X mount do not have any form of stabilisation so the inclusion of I.B.I.S is a massive benefit if you shoot with prime lenses. It will allow you to shoot handheld video and longer shutter duration photos in low light situations.

To sum up the main benefits this camera has over the X-T30, they are the image stabilisation, the grip, the custom dial and the flip screen. It has everything all that you ever need for a hybrid shooter. But if there is one thing I do miss, it is the dial you get on the X-T30 that is sadly missing on the X-S10, the focus mode dial….."
11882,5.0,"Ich bin ein anspruchsvoller Urlaubs-Fotograf, d.h. ich lege Wert auf hochwertige Bilder, aber steige nicht bis in die tiefsten Tiefen der Kamera ein. Nachdem ich jahrelang SLRs von Nikon besaß, bin ich nun zu Fujifilm gewechselt, da ich deren Angebote für um die 1000 Euro am attraktivsten fand.

Was zuerst auffällt. auch gegenüber meinen früheren Nikons, ist die wertige Verarbeitung. Alles fühlt sich solide, langlebig, und nicht nach Plastikspielzeug an. Trotzdem ich große Hände haben lässt sich die Kamera dank des großen Griffes gut halten und bedienen. Dank des gegenüber anderen Fuji-Kameras geänderten Bedien-Konzeptes fällt die Umgewöhnung nicht schwer.

Gleichzeitig ist das Bedienkonzept mein Hauptkritikpunkt: es gibt eine riesige Auswahl an Einstellmöglichkeiten, sowohl im Menü an sich, als auch in der Belegung der Buttons/Tasten. Und da ist die UX einfach nicht gut. Zum einen hätte man das Menü in einen Einfach/Erweitert-Bereich splitten, zum anderen hätte man mehr Hilfen bei den oft kryptischen Bezeichnungen anbieten können. Auch das Quickmenü sollte nicht nur auf Icons basieren, sondern zusätzlich Labels aufweisen. Das wäre innerhalb des Menüs sicher darstellbar.
Sicher, man kann sich einarbeiten, aber es ginge besser.

Das trübt den Gesamteindruck aber nur minimal, denn hat man sich dort durchgequält - oder nimmt einfach die Auto-Einstellung - wird man mit brillianten Bildern belohnt, die aus der Kamera heraus hervorragend sind, und den Nachbearbeitungs-Aufwand erheblich reduzieren. Hier ist das Ergebnis erheblich besser als bei meiner vorherigen Nikon. Auch das Kit-Objektiv ist weit besser als das, was ich bisher gewohnt war.

Alles in allem eine sehr empfehlenswerte Kamera."

11884,4.0,"Fujifilm X-S10 with 16-80mm lens. There are several Fujifilm X series cameras to choose from. This has the latest of everything, with in body image stabilisation, the version 4 sensor and processing and the same lens options.

So, you get fantastic photos and Fujifilm’s amazing film simulation options for beautiful photo tone and colours without needing to learn editing software. All this is also true of other new models.

What sets the X-S10 apart is how easy it makes everything. It has a layout and control scheme the is more similar to other brands, taking a step away from the retro inspired manual controls of others in the range.

So, if having manual control of everything is something you don’t really want to worry about, but you still want the Fujifilm style and quality. This is the one to get.

I’ve had mine a month or more now, shooting about 3,000 images. All I can say is ‘wow’! What this camera can do is just ridiculous. The quality is incredible and the stabilisation allows hand held shots way after sunset. It’s nuts what you can get away with. So happy to have it."
11885,1.0,"Lo que hay que saber respeto a las cámaras fotográficas es que no hay cámara que sea perfecta. Siempre le encontraremos algún ""pero"" y seguramente la compararemos con nuestra cámara anterior. En mi caso vengo de una Samsung NX-500 que toma muy buenas fotos pero dejó de ser compatible a partir del iPhone XS y no pude conectarla más remotamente. Me ha costado bastante tiempo descubrir cuál era la cámara equivalente para reemplazarla. Me parece haber acertado con la Fujifilm X-S10, pues toma excelentes fotos. Estuve dudando en comprarla con el objetivo de 16-80 pero finalmente analicé para que la quería y primó más la ligereza y el poder llevarla cómodamente en el cuello sin que moleste (18-55 finalmente).
He añadido dos fotos de paisajes tomadas con esta cámara y los detalles y colores son increíbles. Es cierto que no en todas las situaciones se obtienen fotografías así y probablemente en algún momento se necesitará ajustar el contraste (bajarlo) con algún programa de edición.
La conexión con el móvil a través del programa Cam Remote es interesante pero me parece que necesita cierto desarrollo, ya que, en algunos casos, cuando quiero tomar fotos utilizando el móvil, la imagen se congela y tarda en conectarse. No me extraña porque he tenido otras cámaras que les pasaba algo similar. Espero que con alguna actualización mejoren este punto, que fue precisamente el que me motivó a cambiar de cámara.
Finalmente mi petición es para Amazon, para que controle a los falsos vendedores que pululan por aquí. En más de una ocasión he comprado productos y luego me han anulado la venta. Eso genera mucha frustración pues uno cree haber encontrado el producto deseado a un precio increíble y no es así."
11886,3.0,
11887,4.0,"Soyons honnête, le fujifilm XS-10 est un excellent boîtier. Il est très réactif et la prise en main est vraiment excellente (meilleure que sur certains full frame haut de gamme).

L'écran LCD complètement articulé et tactile est un bonheur à utiliser pour la photo de rue et contrairement à certains autres avis, le viseur électronique n'est pas du tout trop petit(même si l'on porte des lunettes).

Oui mais voilà, il comporte pour moi un défaut ""objectif"" et un défaut ""subjectif"".
Objectivement, la batterie se vide beaucoup trop vite. Le boîtier est parfait pour la photo de rue en terme de poids et d'ergonomie MAIS une après-midi de street photographie vous demandera d'emporter plusieurs batteries car leur autonomie est vraiment faiblarde (surtout en comparaison du récent XT-4 ou des hybrides Sony), ce qui est vraiment regrettable.

Enfin, et c'est la raison pour laquelle j'ai renvoyé ce boîtier à amazon, il faut être familier du ""rendu fujifilm"" qui donne un aspect ""argentique""/bruité/rugueux aux photos que l'on prend, photos qui me semblent manquer de netteté, clarté et d'éclat par rapport à ce qu'on obtient chez Nikon.
Mais les afficionados de photographie argentique y trouveront tout à fait leur bonheur."

11890,4.0,"Ich muss Vorweg der Rezension von Herrn Stähle wiedersprechen. Ich kann beim besten Willen nicht verstehen, warum jemand ein Produkt mit 1 Stern bewertet, nur auf Grundlage einer fehlenden BDA?
Zumal auch die Aussage mzum Fujifilm Support nicht stimmt. Ich habe den Support per E-Mail angeschrieben und habe innerhabl von einer halben Stunde eine Rückmeldung samt deutscher Bedienungsanleitung als PDF Datei bekommen!
Auch kann man inzwischen auf der Homepage die BDA (auch in deutsch) kostenlos herunterladen. Somit sind seine Aussagen in seiner Rezension nicht wahr!

Zur Kamera und dem Objektiv. Alles in allem sehr erstklassig verarbeitet und macht sofort einen sehr hochwertigen Eindruck. Das Objektiv ist aus Metall und liegt sehr schön in der Hand. In Kombi mit der Kamera ist die Haptik sehr ausgewogen.

Bei der Kamera fällt sofort der Griff auf und es macht Spass die Kamera zu halten. Kein Vergleich zu anderen Kameras in ihrer Größe. Ich komme von Canon und die X-S10 entspricht in etwa der Canon EOS M5. Da kann sich Canon noch ein paar Scheiben abschneiden, was Materialien, Ausstattung und Preis-Leistungsverhältnis angeht.
Den Wechsel habe ich nicht bereut und es macht einfach Spass mit der Kamera zu arbeiten.

Auch der Retro-Look, für den Fujifilm bekannt ist, trifft genau meinen Geschmack. Die Bedienung ist sehr einfach, wenn man sich mit der Kamera vertraut gemacht hat. Das schöne bei Fuji ist, man kann alle Tasten und Bedienelemte nach seinen eigenen Wünschen konfigurieren. Das geht bei Canon nur sehr bedingt und auch hier hat Fuji deutlich die Nase vorn, was das Handling und den Workflow angeht.

Das schöne an der X-S10 ist, dass Fuji hier eine Brücke für Wechsler schlägt, durch sein geändertetes Bedienkozept. Mit dieser Kamera kommen Neueinsteiger von anderen Herstellern wie Sony, Canon oder Nikon sehr leicht zurecht.

Ich kann nur sagen, dass Fujifilm mit der X-S10 eine hochwertige Kamera an den Start gebracht hat, welche mit vielen Ausstattungsmerkmalen einer Highend-Kamera versehen ist und das zu einem Preis von knapp unter 1.000 Euro für den Body. Da kann man bei anderen Herstellern lange suchen, das gibt es einfach nicht."
11891,5.0,
11892,5.0,"Vorweg, die Kamera ist absolut empfehlenswert für Neueinstiger in die Fujiwelt. Ich bin ein großer Canon Fan und fotografiere überwiegend mit EOS R5 und R6 und den entsprechenden RF-Objektiven aus der L Serie. Warum also zusätzlich noch eine Fuji? Nun, im Gegensatz zur Vollformat ist sie wirklich sehr handlich und ich bekomme alle meine Objektive in eine kleine Fototasche. Ich kann die Kamera also überall mitnehmen, wo ich sonst meine Canons zuhause liegen lassen würde.
Zu Beginn war ich noch unschlüssig, ob ich die Kamera behalten sollte. Die ersten Ergebnisse mit dem (wirklich guten) Kitobjektiv waren ernüchternd und hatten mich nicht überzeugt. Mein Hauptbereich ist die Portraitfotografie und da bin ich es gewohnt sehr offenblendig zu fotografieren. Und das geht mit so einem Kitobjektiv eben nicht.
Allerdings hatte ich mir die Kamera ja für andere Einsatzzwecke zugelegt und da hat sie mich wirklich überzeugt. Für Landschaftsaufnahmen oder Architektur ist das Kitobjektiv wirklich fantastisch. Eine sehr hochwertige Optik im Gegensatz zu den Kitobjektiven, die man üblicherweise so bekommt.
Ich habe mir mittlerweile noch weitere Objektive zugelegt und mit einem 35mm f/0,95 bekomme ich sogar den Look hin, den ich bei Vollformat gewohnt bin.
Die Bedienung der Kamera ist sehr intuitiv und es fiel mir leicht auch ohne Bedienungsanleitung loszulegen."

11894,5.0,Top Produkt. Wird für Tierfotografie an einem 100-400 mit 2x Converter genutzt. Mit gecroppten 1200mm perfekt.

11895,5.0,
11896,4.0,"Diese Kamera geht einen anderen Weg als andere Modelle von Fuji. Das ist mutig, da Fuji Fanboys das klassische Bedienkonzept vermissen werden und man damit rechnen kann, dass die Kamera deswegen bei einigen als mega uncool gelten wird. Die XT3 z.B. wird immer ästhetisch vorne sein und ist jetzt schon ein modern classic. Die X-S10 ist dagegen just another camera und wird irgendwann vergessen sein. Obwohl sie technisch ja absolut ebenbürtig ist.

Besondere Vorsicht ist jetzt geboten in der Auswahl, weil die XT3 derzeit Ende 2020 mit Fuji Cash Back genauso teuer ist, aber eigentlich hochwertiger gebaut ist (Die XT3 ist wetterfest und hat den besseren Sucher!!). Nun - dafür hat die X-S10 IBIS, ist kleiner und hat diesen genialen Griff. Aber da die Fuji Coolness ein wenig wegfällt, muss man natürlich schon überlegen, ob die viel günstigere Nikon Z50 nicht die bessere Wahl ist. Die hat nämlich auch einen richtigen Griff - im Gegensatz zu den anderen Fujis.

Also: Tolle Kamera, aber man muss sich gut überlegen, ob man das wirklich so will... Ich denke mit der XT3 wäre ich zufriedener, aber die XS10 ist so eine schöne kleine point and shoot Kamera und man möchte einfach nur in full Auto damit Bilder machen. Trotzdem : Ich denke der Hype vor release war nicht gerechtfertigt. Ob IBIS das killer feature ist... ich denke nicht.

Update: Nach einigen Tagen mit der Kamera bleibe ich dabei: Es geht um schnelle, unkomplizierte und herausragende Fotos mit zeitgemäßem Video. Manuelle Sachen gehen zwar alle, gehen aber nicht so flott von der Hand. Für manuelle Ambitionen und das klassische Kameragefühl hat Fuji andere tolle Kameras. Letztlich für mich der Griff der ausschlaggebende Punkt und die wunderschönen Bilder, die man mit einer Einfachheit macht, die man gar nicht mehr missen will."

11898,5.0,"Lo mejor de las cámaras Fuji son los JPEGs, con otras marcas tienes que usar RAW y luego echarle horas con un programa avanzado para obtener resultados similares. Los colores son geniales y no tiene nada de colores falsos incluso a ISO 12800.
Como pasa con todas las cámaras digitales, la configuración por defecto no aprovecha todas sus posibilidades. En mi opinión hay que activar el DR-P (arregla muy bien los contraluces y no tiene efectos negativos en otros casos) y poner la reducción de ruido al mínimo (hay más ""granos"" de ruido pero son más finos y se mantienen mucho mejor los detalles).

El 18-55 es muy rápido enfocando y al grabar video con el micro de la cámara no se oye para nada. Otra ventaja es que no cambia de focal al enfocar.

A diferencia de otras Fuji, los controles de la cámara son ""modernos"" (parecidos al resto de marcas) y a mí me parecen bastante más cómodos y configurables (5 botones y una rueda) que los ""clásicos"". Otra ventaja es la empuñadura que permite usar la cámara con una mano (la derecha)."

En enfoque trabaja de maravilla, es silenciosa, pesa poco, muy compacta y el objetivo del kit es realmente bueno. Yo tengo una Canon 5D con objetivos L, sé lo que es la calidad y esta cámara cumple muy bien en todo tipo de situaciones. Muy versatil con la pantalla táctil y articulada. El visor electrónico también aporta buenas prestaciones pues puedes ver en el momento todos los ajustes que haces, por ejemplo de exposición.
Los objetivos son muy ligeros y es un equipo que puedes llevar a todos lados.

La costruzione e' ottima, si sente subito la solidita' del corpo macchina e della lente ( nel mio caso il 18-55 XF) .
I menu' sono sembrati un po' complessi a primo impatto, ma dopo qualche giorno iniziano ad avere senso.

La qualita' delle immaggini e' ottima anche in JPEG, grazie alle simulazioni pellicola e ad una vasta gamma di settaggi disponibili.

Il mio utilizzo principale e' il video, e devo dire che se la cava egregiamente. La stabilizzazione del sensore aiuta molto, anche con l'utilizzo di lenti senza OIS.
Il grip piu' grande rispetto alle altre fuji permette di effettuare riprese a mano con piu' sicurezza.

La mancanza dello slot UHS-II e della registrazione 10-bit interna potrebbe far storcere il naso ai professionisti, ma per uso amatoriale o semi-pro credo sia una ottima macchina. Inoltre questi problemi sono risolvibili con un registratore esterno."

I appreciate that for most Fujifilm lovers, part of that love affair is because of the level of manual control at their fingertips but the X-S10 is perfect for me as I still get the beautiful colours and quality without any great effort.

11936,3.0,"I got this item delivered. There are lot of reviews about this product. So, I will not repeat mostly.

* Good camera for personal use. I not a professional. So I can't comment on that.
* Compact and feels very sturdy.
* Very good autofocus (with fast eye detection).
* Easy to use. I did not read any manual.
* Too many options to explore. I was using an old Sony DSLR. So the menu system was a bit overwhelming.
* Very good quality pictures and videos.
* EVF is good.

It did not come with a charger. But it was good for me as I had few good quality USB type C adapters.

Let me talk about delivery. I was a bit skeptical about the delivery as this is the first time I am ordering an item with this price from an online store.

As usual, the item was well packaged with proper security measures to avoid theft and tampering. Before opening I observed that the box was not in perfect shape. So, I took a video of unboxing to use as evidence if something is wrong inside. But that was not the case. When I removed the external cover, I could see that it came with a bag (surprise...), which was making it as odd shape. But otherwise camera was in a well sealed box. It also had one memory card. The listing did not mention bag and card. So, I got two extra items. A bag and a card."
11937,4.0,"Excellent build quality. Can feel bit heavy with kit lens but not a deal breaker. Menu and settings can overwhelm initially but as u start using the camera and learning more u gain more confidence with manual settings.

What could improve -
Battery life for photos is decent but club it with video capture; battery drain fast.
Autofocus not upto mark

I am happy with this buy."
11939,4.0,"IBIS and AF not that good. Most of the pics captured were out of focus. Need to be extra cautious while taking pics. If u don't need flip screen, better to go with XT3. XT3 has weather sealing and great view finder and good screen. Lenses are expensive. Try to buy 16-80 it covers more needs than 18-55. For someone coming from smartphone, there is learning curve. Also be ready to spend lot of money on lens. At least on zoom and one wide angle are needed in addition to kit lens. Picture quality is good, but we need to know how to use it. If you are a casual user/traveller, just go with Iphone 13, which very easy to carry, always with us. Phone is portable, user friendly, everything will be in focus, easy to share pics and save. No need to carry a huge camera bag with charger, camera body, 2 lens, extra memory card, cable to transfer pics. I did 2 trips with this camera, it was hell of experience. Also, we can't take some help from other to click a pic for us, as it needs some expertise. Also, Iphone/any phone covers a lot of focal lengths, this camera is limited to 18mm that too with f2.8, which is not great. f1.4 lens is great for picture quality. They are very expensive.
In short, camera is not required for casual users. Carry lens and changing lens is big issue."
11940,4.0,"I had been looking for a good camera for under Rs 1 lakh for sometime when Fujifilm launched this camera last year and it immediately became a hot favourite of several camera review forums/channels. From a value for money perspective, I think this camera has no competition in the market if you try to find a feature to feature match for this price. From a cost to performance perspective it gets even better. This is a very capable camera. In a few days that I have spent with it, I have found myself pleasantly surprised multiple times by the quality of images that it produces and I am not even talking about the quality of raw files here. I know that relying on SOOC JPEGs may not be a feasible option for a lot of people. However I think if you are so inclined, this is the camera that fits the bill. This is a fairly advanced camera and it is heavily customizable. And although it is very easy to get your photos out of it and into a smartphone, you can't expect the workflow to be the same as a smartphone camera. But then again, the image quality you get is light years ahead of what the best smartphone cameras can do. I bought it without the kit lens and paired it with the cheap xc35mm f2 prime and so far I'm loving it."

Bought it with the 16-80 and so far I definitely like the camera."
11942,5.0,"Let me admit, I was a little sceptical before buying this masterpiece. After all you are graduating up from DSLR to a mirrorless one and that too requiring a deeper pocket. But then quality comes at a price.
The feel is superb, the grip perfect and overall balanced.
The pictures are sharp, focus is above average. It keeps springing surprises when you try to be adventurous, it never disappoints you. It is always ready whenever you are. The battery drains relatively fast as compared to a DSLR, but a beast of such magnitude would require that much power.

11947,4.0,"Prima di questa macchina fotografica avevo una Nikon D5000 con obiettivo 35mm f 1.8, ossia una reflex APS-C CMOS del 2009. Pe quanto possa sembrare scontato che in tutti questi anni ci siano stati enormi miglioramenti, anche la mia vecchia Nikon scattava ottime foto e la qualità dell'immagine in generale è stato l'ultimo punto che mi ha spinto a fare questo passaggio. In questa recensione voglio quindi spiegare cosa cambia e cosa offre questa Fujifilm X-S10 e a chi è rivolta.

PARTE 1: DIFFERENZA generica tra REFLEX e MIRRORLESS:
Mirrorless = senza specchio, ossia senza lo specchio davanti al sensore che nelle reflex manda l'immagine verso l'alto al mirino ottico. A parte questo, proprio come le Reflex, anche le Mirrorles consentono di avere ottiche intercambiabili.

DIMENSIONI: l'assenza dello specchio permette dimensioni ridotte sia del corpo macchina, che delle ottiche. Con l'ottica giusta (tipo il mio FUJINON XF 27 mm f2.8), questa macchina sta tranquillamente nella tasca di un giubbotto o nella taschina degli zaini solitamente riservata a occhiali da sole e altre piccole cose. Sicuramente l'altra ottica che ho scelto, il 16-80, non va affatto in questa direzione essendo una delle più grandi, ma il 18-55 f2.8 che si può scegliere come alternativa è a mio avviso un ottimo compromesso essendo piccolissimo e offrendo una qualità ottica decisamente superiore ai classici 18-55 kit (basti pensare che l'apertura di partenza è f.2.8 e non 3.5). Per farsi un'idea delle dimensioni allego delle foto comparative.

AUTOFOCUS: Poichè il sensore è costantemente attivo (nelle reflex viene attivato solo quando lo specchio si alza quando si scatta la foto) consente un autofocus sia più preciso che più rapido. Ad esempio, questa Fuji riesce a individuare i volti, a regolare l'esposizione in modo ottimale per questi e a mettere a fuoco automaticamente sugli occhi, tutte cose che sulle reflex erano possibili solo in modalità Live View (solo sul display, mentre qui anche sul mirino) e con notevole perdita delle prestazioni (la mia Nikon impiegava addirittura 10 o più secondi a mettere a fuoco in modalità live View e anche lo scatto non era immediato).
Infine, segnalo che questa Fuji riesce a mettere a fuoco anche in condizioni di pessima illuminazione (addirittura -6 stop) e in generale è molto molto più rapida a mettere a fuoco.

ANTEPRIMA ESPOSIZONE: Sempre per il motivo che il sensore è sempre attivo, è possibile visualizzare direttamente sul display o sul mirino un'anteprima dell'esposizione dell'immagine sulla base dei parametri impostati. Ciò era possibile anche su alcune reflex (non sulla mia) ma, come per l'autofocus sui volti, solo in modalità live View con tutte le conseguenze già dette al punto precedente. Senza di ciò ci si doveva basare solo sulle indicazioni dell'esposimetro (la lineetta con i + e i - in basso), il che ovviamente si riferiva solo a un singolo punto dell'immagine e non consentiva di farsi un'idea su tutto il resto della foto (si doveva andare a tentativi). Così l'esperienza è simile a quella che si ha con uno smartphone.

MIRINO OLED: per quanto l'immagine che si apprezza nelle reflex direttamente riflessa dallo specchio sia stata a lungo considerata superiore, la qualità dei mirini OLED attuali non fa rimpiangere ed anzi segna un altro puto a favore delle mirrorless (e di questa Fuji): non solo la qualità è ottima, grazia sia all'altissima risoluzione dello schermino del mirino sia al fatto che sia oled e che quindi abbia contrasti perfetti con neri assoluti (e non grigi), ma anche è possibile apprezzare sul mirino funzioni altrimenti relegate solo al display (come l'anteprima dell'esposizione, del bilanciamento del bianco, del profilo colore, dell'HDR e altro).

CONTRO: Batteria. sicuramente il fatto che sensore e display/mirino siano sempre accesi comporta dei consumi molto maggiori. Con la mia reflex non avevo mai sentito la necessità di una seconda batteria, mentre con questa può essere necessario se si prospetta di dover scattare molte foto (per viaggi o giornate normali invece si arriva tranquillamente a sera con carica residua). Comodo a tal proposito che la ricarica avvenga (anche) via USB-C (senza dover rimuovere la batteria), con lo stesso caricabatterie del cellulare (una cosa in meno da portarsi in viaggio) e che si possa ricaricare anche con una powerbank e usarla contemporaneamente (utile se ad esempio non si dispone di una seconda batteria).

PARTE 2: DIFFERENZA GENERICA TRA APS-C E FULL-FRAME O MICRO 4:3
DIMENSIONI: Anche in questo caso, a parità di tipologia (mirrroless), le APS-C sono più piccole delle FULL-Frame sia per quanto riguarda il corpo macchina che le ottiche. In generale le ritengo un giusto compromesso tra full-frame (sensore più grande, dimensioni maggiori) e micro 4:3 (sensore più piccolo e dimensioni ancora inferiori).

OTTICHE: Le ottiche APS-C sono generalmente più piccole e molto meno costose, tuttavia, è opportuno ricordare che la quantità di sfocato che viene generato da aperture molto luminose è ridotta e va convertita con un indice di 1:1,5. Mi spiego meglio, il livello di sfocato che si otterrà con un’ottica APS-C f. 1.8 è lo stesso che si otterrebbe con un’ottica per full-frame di focale equivalente f. 1.8 x 1,5 = 2,7 ≈ f 2.8, quindi per il processo inverso se si vuole ottenere uno sfocato (bokeh) pari a un 2.8 full frame, su una fotocamera APS-C si deve optare per un obiettivo f. 1.8. Ad ogni modo, l’APS-C è il giusto mezzo tra full frame e macchine fotografiche con sensori più piccoli (in cui questo discorso è ancora più accentuato).
Infine ricordo che per calcolare la focale full frame equivalente anche in questo caso si deve moltiplicare per 1.5 (quindi un’ottica APS-C 35mm è all’incirca pari a un 50 mm full frame come angolo di campo dell’inquadratura).

COSTO: a parità di caratteristiche, le APS-C costano in genere anche 1000 o più euro in meno di una full frame. Infatti, per comprare una Full frame completa di tutte le caratteristiche che questa Fuji X-S10 offre si devono scomodare modelli professionali da 2-3.000€, senza contare il costo delle ottiche, molto maggiore per le full frame. Lo ripeto ancora una volta, le APS-C mi sembrano il giusto compromesso tra costo e qualità offerta.

ISO / LUCE: va detto che un sensore più piccolo significa necessariamente meno luce che entra. Tuttavia, questa macchina fotografica regge davvero davvero bene gli iso anche alti, il che insieme alla stabilizzazione su sensore (che permette di alzare i tempi di esposizione anche a mano libera) permette di compensare senza grossi problemi la minore luce che entra. Anche quando gli iso si fanno davvero alti, la grana che si aggiunge è piacevole rispetto ad altre macchine e, poichè si hanno a disposizione 26 MP, alla fine dà poco fastidio.

PARTE 3: PERCHE' proprio FUJIFILM?
SENSORE APS-C XTRANS: Mentre Sony, Nikon, Canon, etc... si concentravano sulle mirrorless full-frame, Fujifilm ha lanciato già da molti anni le sue mirorrless e SOLO nel formato APS-C, dedicando quindi molta più attenzione delle altre già citate case, che hanno rilasciato le loro prime mirrorless APS-C solo di recente.
Inoltre, a differenza dei sensori di praticamente qualsiasi altra macchina fotografica, che sfruttano lo schema Bayer, i sensori Fujifilm proprietari sfruttano un loro schema XTRANS. Questo oltre ad avere rilevanza da un punto di vista della rappresentazione dei colori (vedi dopo), elimina la necessità di avere un filtro passa basso, che nei sensori con schemi Bayer è invece necessario perché previene la formazione di artefatti ma che di fatto riduce la nitidezza delle immagini. Preciso infine anche qui che questo sensore (retroilluminato) regge benissimo gli iso e permette foto ottime anche con poca luce.

STABILIZZAZIONE a livello di SENSORE: oltre alla stabilizzazione ottica presente su numerose ottiche, questa piccola Fuji (già perché di solito è presente in fotocamere più grandi e costose) presenta al suo interno una stabilizzazione anche a livello di sensore.
Nelle ottiche in cui è già presente una stabilizzazione, questo ulteriore stabilizzatore si somma e migliora ulteriormente la capacità di annullare le vibrazioni. Nelle ottiche in cui non lo è inoltre offre un vantaggio ancora più notevole.
Rispetto alla singola stabilizzazione ottica presente sugli obiettivi, comunque, questo genere di stabilizzazione è più rapida e precisa e consente di “guadagnare” fino a 6 stop, che non sono affatto pochi; questo significa che si possono usare tempi di posa a mano libera fino a 6 volte maggiori senza che le foto vengano mosse, un gran vantaggio che ho avuto modo di apprezzare in questi mesi.

COLORI: caratteristica peculiare ormai rinomata di Fujifilm. Non solo la resa dei colori è in generale ottima, ma questa macchina fotografica permette di scegliere tra di preset chiamati “simulazione pellicola” che davvero rappresentano un bel valore aggiunto. I miei preferiti sono “classic Chrome”, che dà un aspetto leggermente vintage davvero bello, “astia”, molto morbido e tenue, perfetto peri i ritratti (vedi foto del gatto e del cane), “velvia”, molto saturo, ideale per i paesaggi e la natura (vedi foto delle case sul Ticino e del fiume in mezzo alla gola) e lo standard “provia” (vedi Matera in notturna); belli anche “eterna”, che ha dato un look molto cinematografico ai miei scatti a Matera e “classic negative”, che riproduce i colori delle classiche foto fatte a rullino (vedi foto con ragazza e bambino sugli scogli). Bellissimo b/n con “acros” infine.
Grazie a questa eccellente elaborazione dei JPEG e a questi profili colore (che possono anche essere personalizzati a proprio piacimento), questa Fuji elabora dei JPEG praticamente già pronti, caratteristica non da poco che consente di non dover trascorrere ore ed ore ad elaborare i file raw come sarebbe necessario fare con altre macchine fotografiche.

INTERFACCIA UTENTE: rispetto ad altre macchine (in particolare le Sony), i menù sono ben organizzati. Inoltre sono presenti numerosi controlli virtuali, tasti fisici e ghiere, tutti personalizzabili in base alle proprie esigenze e preferenze, e in generale l’ergonomia di questa macchina fotografica è ottima, sia da un punto di vista di tenerla in mano (altre Fuji peccavano in questo a favore di un aspetto più retò) sia in termini di controlli. Rispetto ad altre Fuji (X-T30, X-T4) ha perso la possibilità di premere le ghiere per fare switch tra le varie funzioni assegnate, ma non ne ho mai vista l’esigenza in quanto i nuovi controlli PASM (senza ghiera dei tempI) sono ben organizzate e tutti i controlli sono sempre a portata di mano. Ho prezzato tantissimo la presenza di una ghiera dedicata alla compensazione dell’esposizione, cosa ormai presente in tutte le fotocamere ma che la mia vecchia Nikon non aveva e mi costringeva a muovermi tra mille controlli per regolare una funzione così fondamentale.
Utile poi la presenza del menù Q, dove si possono scegliere fino a 16 impostazioni da avere a portata di mano, e il fatto che i controlli assegnati a ghiere e pulsanti possano essere regolati osservando il cambiamento in diretta mentre ci si muove tra le varie opzioni perché non ostruiscono lo schermo (utile per il bilanciamento del bianco e per la simulazione pellicola sopratutto).

ESTETICA: per quanto meno retrò rispetto ad altri modelli della casa per via dell’assenza della ghiera dei tempi, anche lei conserva un aspetto decisamente retrò quando abbinata ad obiettivi quali il mio 27mm f2.8, mentre al contrario appare decisamente professionale e più moderna quando abbinata al 16-80 f4.0. Personalmente, da un punto di vista estetico non mi piaceva in foto quando paragonata ad esempio alla X-T30, anche per via della presenza di un’unica colorazione (non è disponibile il caratteristico bicolore argento o argento scuro); mi sono però ricreduto dal vivo, in quanto appare decisamente più bella. Ricordo che il materiale è metallico, anzichè plastico, del corpo proprio come degli obiettivi (serie XF, mentre gli XC sono in plastica).

COSTO: Obiettivamente la migliore da un punto di vista qualità prezzo; la sua concorrente, la Sony alpha 6600, ossia un’altra mirrorless con sensore APS-C stabilizzato e caratteristiche simili (per quanto in vari aspetti inferiori) costa sui 500€ in più. In generale una differenza di prezzo così ampia non si apprezza sul resto della gamma Fujifilm.

OTTICHE: le ottiche Fuji sono di ottima qualità e sicuramente non ne rimarrete delusi (come non ne sono rimaso deluso io). In generale consiglio uno zoom variabile tra il 18-55 f.2.8 e il 16-80 f.4, a seconda del budget, e un fisso sui 35mm quale ad esempio il Fuji XC 35mm f2.0 che vale assolutamente i 200€ che costa ed è tutto sommato compatto. Se non avete mai usato ottiche fisse (e in generqale un 35mm APSC, ossia un 50 mm equivalente) in passato vi consiglio caldamente di provare: per quanto all’invio possa sembrare scomodo non poter variare focale e soprattutto questa focale (50mm equivalente), appena prenderete l’abitudine le vostre foto raggiungeranno un livello totalmente nuovo. Infine, molto compatto, ottimo otticamente e dall’aspetto retrò il 27 mm f2.8 che vedete in foto. Fujifilm ha aperto ad ottiche di terze parti solo da poco, quindi in generale non ce ne sono molte (segnalo a tal proposito le Viltrox) ma al gamma Fujifilm è davvero completa e il fatto che, come dicevo prima, Fuji si sia concentrata primariamente sulle APS-C (e non sulle full frame, come altre case) fa si che ci siano obiettivi per tutte le necessita (e portafogli).

PARTE 4: ALTRO
DISPLAY: per quanto sia spesso sottovalutato, mi sono reso conto con la mia vecchia Nikon (che aveva un pessimo display in quanto risoluzione) quanto importante possa essere il display di una fotocamera; infatti, diventa difficile rendersi conto se una foto è venuta bene o male con un display scarso, non accorgendosi persino se una foto è fuori fuoco o meno. La risoluzione del display di questa Fuji, con i suoi 1,04 milioni di pixel, si colloca al di sopra di molte mirrorless fullframe (tipo Sony Alpha 7 III e la concorrenza APS-C di Nikon e Canon, che ne hanno in genere sui 900 mila), per quanto non sia ai vertici (la sorella XT-4 e la XT-30 Mark II ne hanno 1.6 milioni). Ad ogni modo, questo display è ottimo per risoluzione, resa cromatica e angolo di visuale, ed è pure orientabile (il che è utile in molte situazioni). Personalmente, data la mia brutta esperienza di questi anni con il display della Nikon, mi ero imposto di non comprare nessuna nuova fotocamera con display con meno di 1 milione di punti.

DIMENSIONI FILE, FORMATI: È possibile scattare sia in RAW che in JPEG che in entrambi allo stesso tempo. Inoltre è possibile scegliere se si preferiscono RAW compressi o non e se si preferisce una compressione senza perdita o maggiore (i RAW compressi non sono supportati da molti software e necessitano preferibilmente di Capture One, quello fornito in dotazione, ma consumano meno spazio). Il Mac e l'iPhone sono compatibili nativamente con i Raw di questa X-S10 solo se non compressi, altrimenti consiglio di usare Capture One oppure RAW Power, che da un po' supporta anche i file compressi, supporta i profili colore delle simulazioni pellicola ufficiali ed è disponibile come acquisto una tantum (non abbonamento come Lightroom o photoshop) sia per Mac (39€) sia per iPhone/iPad (10€).
Un file JPEG alla massima risoluzione occupa sui 12-15 MB, mentre per un RAW passiamo a circa 50MB a foto.

MANUALE: ho apprezzato il manuale (in italiano), disponibile in formato digitale sia pdf sia interattivo, in quanto davvero completo. Inoltre, Fujifilm rilascia piccole integrazioni per le funzioni aggiunte con gli aggiornamenti firmware successivi alla pubblicazione del manuale pdf. Il cartaceo non è presente, ma non lo rimpiango in quanto la versione interattiva può essere consultata dal cellulare in ogni momento e in modo più agevole.

FLASH INTEGRATO: piccolo, ma utile in alcune circostanze. Rispetto a quello che avevo nella mia Nikon è più esile, ma è comunque efficace in alcune situazioni (per quanto non ami la fotografia con flash).

ACCESSORI CONSIGLIATI: Io ho comprato il caro, ma utile, kit di Peak Design per convertire la tracolla inclusa (in pelle, nera, carina) e poterla staccare quando voglio usare la maniglia (sempre Peak Design, visibile in foto) o non voglio niente attaccato (utile se voglio ridurre al minimo l'ingombro). Si trovano entrambi su amazon, ma vi consiglio di guardare anche sul sito di Peak Design perché nel mio caso il prezzo pure includendo le spese di spedizione era inferiore. Inoltre consiglio un proteggi schermo qualsiasi in vetro fatto apposta per Fuji X-S10 (per quanto il display possa essere chiuso e protetto talvolta è utile lasciato aperto e graffiarlo sarebbe un peccato). Io uso poi un lettore di schede SD per il cellulare (iPhone, nel mio caso) per passare le foto en plein d'air perché l'app è davvero lenta, mentre cosi in qualche secondo si passano centinaia di foto. Consiglio infine il treppiedi piccolo e portatile JOBY GorillaPod 1K.

APP/GEOTAG FOTO: per quanto l'applicazione sia recensita molto male e il passaggio delle foto al cellulare sia piuttosto lento e in generale scomodo, volevo la presenza di un’interfaccia con il cellulare principalmente per assegnare la posizione alle alle foto (geotag), proprio come avviene quando scatto una foto con il cellulare, e questo avviene piuttosto bene con l’app. Con il mio nuovo iPhone 13 Pro la fotocamera si collega ed apre l'app in background per ottenere la posizione automaticamente, anche se l'app non viene aperta da molto tempo. Con il mio vecchio iPhone, o in generale nel caso in cui non dovesse collegarsi alla fotocamera in automatico, basterà aprire l'app sul cellulare a inizio giornata e poi il processo funziona tranquillamente senza problemi. Non ho notato rilevanti consumi di batteria sul cellulare e comodo che sincronizzi anche l'orario per averlo sempre preciso. In generale la fotocamera non chiede la posizione al cellulare per ogni foto, ma solo ogni tot di tempo.

Spero di aver chiarito ogni possibile dubbio e che questa recensione vi sia stata utile!"
11948,4.0,
11949,2.0,"This is my first Fujifilm camera (ever!) as I've always been a Canon-man (and Panasonic if I go back far enough). When I saw the press-release of this X-S10 and read a few of the initial reviews, I was pretty sure I had found my new camera and camera system.

While my Canon DSLR was good - it was starting to show its age and I reached a point in my photography where I felt that I ""needed"" something different to improve and inspire me to get back out there and click that shutter. I travel a lot (or used to pre-COVID but will hopefully start again next year) so I liked the idea of a more compact mirrorless camera. Aside from travel photography my main interests are usually wildlife and cityscape/street so again a less obvious camera/lens setup would be helpful. I had never really considered a Fujifilm before the X-S10 as all those dials on top and endless buttons and labels on different models seemed confusing and a bit over the top. Sorry to all Fujifilm lovers who adore those things, just for me it stopped my making the leap before now. I imagine this new camera will divide users on whether or not this is a ""proper"" Fujifilm because of the different approach to design and button layout, but it was enough to make me jump ship so it might bring others to the Fujifilm family.

From out the box, using and becoming familiar with the S10 was a bit difficult. I have no point of comparison from older Fujifilm models to this one (as I mentioned its my first) but it is definitely very different from Canon. The menu system is more complex, with a lot more options and pages upon pages to get to grips with. There is nothing wrong with this - I doubt that previous FF users will have any difficultly but there will be a bit of a learning curve for others. I was glad the PSAM dial was there to help me out (used AUTO for a while to get to grips with the camera. I was pleased to find the four custom options as well as the customisable left and right dial (for the moment I've left them as default). While I didn't like it at first, I have found after a week that the ""joystick"" to navigate the screen is better than a D-pad (which I was used to) and is very responsive.

Build quality is high as you would expect at this price point and I was surprised with both the display quality of the eye piece and from the LCD screen. The layout of the screen is good but I would recommend you go into settings and somewhere (as I can't remember where) there is a option to increase the size of the icons and information displays on the screen (which was helpful). The camera is compact (owing to the system) but fits in the hand well. It does feel just a bit smaller than it should be (if that makes sense) but I imagine I will get used to it. The grip on the right is deep and the perfect size to be comfortable to hold and operate the camera for long periods.

I have a few issues with the design, I don't know how common they are to FF cameras. Firstly I found it strange to have the SD card slot in the same compartment as the battery. I don't know why but it just ""annoys"" me a bit, I suppose because I am used to having separate compartments. I have no problem with a single card SD slot but I was a bit disappointed to find it only supports UHS-1 memory cards. I have had other cheaper models that supported the faster cards. Personally I have not found (yet) that it affects photography or video in any negative way (even 4K records perfectly) so you could argue that its not needed. One thing that WAS a problem and will take a lot to get used to is that small on/off switch. Is it just me or is that really small? It's also not the easiest to turn on and off especially if you have large (or cold) fingers.

I was worried about what I had heard about the ""poor battery life"" from reading about the camera elsewhere, however I would say battery life is reasonable. They don't last as long as my previous canon's but considering they are smaller I would say it was a reasonable trade-off. Bottom line is that you are going to need at least one spare if you plan on being out all day or doing something shutter intensive (such as a wedding) but you are not going to need the ""loads"" that some reviewers have suggested elsewhere. An great advantage is that the battery can be charged in camera via a USB-C cable. You can charge your battery from a laptop, a power-bank or by plugging the cable into a USB-A plug. The camera does not come with a external charger as such, I believe that is the right choice to keeps things light and compact, but if you want to charge your batteries from the mains (or plan on buying multiple) then you can buy a charger easily (and cheaply) enough. For your reference I spent a day (and most of the night) shooting in Edinburgh zoo and the city centre - exhausted one battery and didn't take much out the second (less than half). Plus it was pretty cool being able to connect it to my power bank to charge on the go.

I have been extremely happy with the image quality even straight from the memory card. I'm using the XF18-55mm F2.8-4 R LM and the XF55-200mm F3.5-4.8 R LM - they are both stunning! While they may seem a bit expensive (considering a 50-200mmm lens is available for half the cost) they are really worth the money. Eventually I will get a Prime or two but at the moment my credit card is full enough. I've enclosed a few examples of the quality achieved out-of-camera from Edinburgh Zoo (still working on my city-centre images). Overall I have been pleased with what I have been able to achieve in a short time, I'm a sure more seasoned FF users would have even more luck.

This model has in body stabilization which is a welcome addition under the one-thousand pound mark. So far I feel it works very well and is very close in operation in comparison to more expensive models.

I've taken a few videos (shutting in 4K at 29.9fps and 200Mb frame-rate) and have been happy with the results. I'm not a massive vlogger or video-shooter but there are plenty of video options (pages and pages) to keep you happy.

The cost of this camera seems about right, personally I would have loved it to be a bit cheaper but I'm sure most of us can say that about most things. For the price you get great build quality and brilliant images with plenty of options and settings to play with. I also have to conclude that the Fujifilm lens system (and options) are much better than what I have had in the past.

If I was asked to review this six months down the line when I've had a lot more experience I maybe more inclined to award 5-stars. For the moment I feel there are a few ""strange"" design quirks such as the small on/off switch, the same memory/battery compartment, lack of UHS-II+ cards and so forth. All of which just makes it fall a tiny bit short. Don't get me wrong, this is still a brilliant camera that is very capable. I hope it appeals to both current FF users and people like me who jumped-ship.

The S10 is a better camera with better lenses than my canon set-up. The cost of this camera and my two lenses works out at about three hundred pound more expensive than my canon and twin lens kit set up was. For what you are getting in return from the S10, that's not bad at all. For me I look forward to getting to use it more (more importantly learning to use it more) and getting back to travelling with a more compact system."
11950,2.0,"Le recensioni non le rendono giustizia. Dico solo che è la mia quarta macchina fotografica e l ho amata da subito. Con le lenti giuste non ha nulla da invidiare all ammiraglia, sua sorella maggiore.
Ergonomia perfetta soprattutto per che sono una donna e ho le mani sottili uno dei motivi per cui ho abbandonato le reflex e ho scelto le mirrorless.
Assolutamente consigliata."
11951,4.0,
11952,1.0,"Dopo averne provate e viste davvero molte mi sono fermato su questo gioellino perchè seppur con qualche compromesso ha davvero tutto quello che si può desiderare da una fotocamera di buon livello.

I prerequisiti erano:
- Obiettivi intercambiabili
- Dimensioni contenute
- stabilizzatore (vi diranno che non serve, che è una cavolata, che ci vuole la mano, che bisogna impostare n-mila settaggi e che se le foto vengono mosse è solo colpa vostra, il che al 90% è vero) averlo è una goduria, anche se pochi gli stop che si guadagno almeno per me sono veramente comodi, e i video sono fantastici, avendo un obbiettivo anch'esso stabilizzato si riescono a fare davvero cose molto interessanti.
- display orientabile/estraibili, che a molti non piace perchè disallinea l'asse obiettivo con quello del mirino, ma a me piace tantissimo. E soprattutto può essere girato a 180° in modo da nascondere e proteggere l'lcd e dando al contempo un look retro che mi piace moltissimo.
- flash, avevo provato la X-E4, anch'essa ottima, ma il flash per quanto piccolo o riduttivo sia, credo sia un qualcosa che non deve mancare.

E la X-S10 ha tutte queste caratteristiche. Ero un po' preoccupato dall'ingombro dell'impugnatura, che mi sembrava troppo pronunciata ma credetemi ora la considero un assoluto punto di forza. Poter impugnare la macchina solo da lì è fantastico.

Detto questo le foto sono come per la altre fuji di fascia X belle e pulite, i filtri delle fuji per le jpg inutile dirlo danno subito risalto alle foto. I 26mp forse un pelino pochi, ma quello che fa la differenza alla fine è la lente che ci montate e l'occhio che avete che anche un non professionista come me può ottenere degli scatti assolutamente soddisfacenti.

Difetti, se così vogliamo chiamarli, possono essere la messa a fuoco che a volte presenta un po' di titubanze, ma risolvibili con qualche correzione, e la connessione al pc, soprattutto in modalità wifi che necessita di un po' di lavoro extra.

Ci sarebbe altro da dire e magari aggiornerò la recensione, per ora la trovo ottima, bella da usare e con una sensazione molto piacevole nel tenerla in mano. Super consigliata."
11953,1.0,
11954,1.0,"Ich habe eine X-T4 und diese Kamera ist für mich perfekt. da stimmt einfach alles. Nun habe ich meine H1 verkauft und mir die X-S10 zugelegt, weil sie von wichtigsten Parametern, die man zum Fotografieren braucht der T4 durchaus gewachsen ist. Was den ganzen Rest betrifft, kann sie der aber nicht das Wasser reichen.
wie gesagt hat sie den AF von der T4, die Bildqualität und auch den Sensor.

Ist sie etwas für den Umsteiger von einem anderen Systems?

Ja, weil es eine spitzenmäßige Kamera ist und Nein !, weil man sich damit genauso beschäftigen muss, wie mit jeder anderen Kamera, um sie bedienen zu können. Ein Wahlrad von S, A, M ist zwar neu bei Fuji reicht aber nicht, um damit reibungslos zu arbeiten. Für den Fuji Nutzer wird das Ganze schon etwas einfacher, weil das Menü nahezu identisch ist im Verhältnis zu anderen Fuji Kameras.
Wie gesagt: Man bekommt eine Spitzen Kamera zum Spitzen Preis und damit muss man sich beschäftigen, um alles aus ihr herauszuholen.

Reicht der alte Akku oder wäre ein neuer besser gewesen?

Für meine Verhältnisse reicht der Akku und schön ist, dass man bei allen Fujis diesen Akku verwenden kann, außer bei der T4.
Der Akku reicht bei mir für 300-400 Bilder und die zwei Sekunden um ihn zu wechseln, kann man ja immer haben.
Ein Zweitakku ist aber Pflicht, wie bei jeder anderen Kamera auch. ich nutze die von Patona und bin damit sehr zufrieden. (kosten um die 10 Euro)

Macht es viel aus, wenn die Kamera nicht wie die T4 wetterfest ist?

Eigentlich nicht und es gibt für alle die gern im strömenden Regen fotografieren geeignete Raincover von zig Anbietern, im Notfall tut es auch einmal eine Plastiktüte. Die T4 ist zwar wetterfest, aber kostet auch 800 Euro mehr. Wer also aus vielen anderen Gründen lieber eine X-S10 möchte, sollte dieses Kriterium nicht berücksichtigen.

Die berühmten Customeinstellungen C1 bis C4, sind sie hilfreich?

Mit den C1 bis C4 Einstellungen, die man über das Wahlrad oben ansteuern kann, hat man die Möglichkeit sich für bestimmte Aufnahmesituationen Voreinstellungen zu konfigurieren.
Beispiel: Ich will ein Portrait machen lege diese Einstellung auf C1... jetzt kann ich für diese Art Foto alles vorher festlegen, von der AF Art, über Kontraste, Weißabgleich, Filmsimulation usw... bis in die absolute Tiefe des Menüs.
Steht ein Portrait an, dann stelle ich auf C1 und fertig. Schön wär 's.
Ich habe die Erfahrung gemacht, dass einem (besser gesagt mir) dieser Kram eigentlich gar nichts nützt, weil es erstens meist nicht hinhaut und man zweitens nicht mehr weiß, was man da alles so konfiguriert hat. Man müsste sich das ja auch noch für die anderen 3 Voreinstellungen merken.
Meine Variante ist die: ich habe eine Kamera, wo ich mein Bild vorher sehe. ich konfiguriere mir meine X-S10 und die Knöpfe und Räder so, dass ich alles erreiche ohne in das Menü zu müssen und bin so schneller. Außerdem kann ich so für aktuelle Aufnahmesituation immer die passenden Parameter wählen.
Für spezielle Aufgaben wie Infrarot oder Sterne macht es dagegen vielleicht Sinn.

Lässt sich die X-S10 besser bedienen als die X-T4?

Für mich nicht, aber man kann sich damit arrangieren. bei der T4 habe ich alle fotorelevanten Einstellungen direkt an der Kamera, dazu sind die Räder auch beschriftet, der AF kann mittels Hebel unten verändert werden usw.
Für mich ist das die klassische Bedienung, weshalb ich mir Fujis zugelegt habe.
Trotzdem kann man sich viele Dinge auch an der S10 dahin legen, wo man sie braucht und nach ein bisschen Zeit, weiß man wo die liegen und kann die Kamera auch reibungslos bedienen.

Ist der IBIS sinnvoll?

Ja er ist in meinen Augen mehr als sinnvoll, weil er alle angesetzten Objektive stabilisiert, egal ob sie einen OIS haben oder nicht. Außerdem sorgt er für ein ruhiges Sucherbild bei langen Brennweiten und für ruhige Freihand -Videos. Ich finde es gar nicht so relevant, ob ich jetzt ein Bild 2s belichten kann, ohne zu verwackeln, aber gerade in den Grenzbereichen so um 1/30s macht man eine Vielzahl an schärferen Bilder, als wenn man keinen hätte. Mit dieser zeit gehen auch noch Portraits bei wenig Licht usw.

Ist die X-S10 gut verarbeitet?

Ja, sehr gut, obwohl sie kompakt und leicht ist. Trotzdem lässt sie sich auch gern in größere Hände nehmen, fasst sich wertig an und macht wie alle Fujis einen soliden Eindruck.

Gibt es etwas zu bemängeln?

Ja, eine spärliche deutsche Anleitung und das fehlende Ladegerät. Nachdem bei der T4 ja wenigstens noch ein Stecker dabei ist, ist es jetzt nur noch ein Kabel. Gut ist, dass es relativ preiswerte Ladegeräte gibt, die man hier kaufen kann.

Fazit: die X-s10 ist eine sehr gute Kamera, mit man alle fotografischen Aufgaben perfekt lösen kann. In Allianz mit perfekten Fuji Objektiven, die fast alle auf höchstem Niveau sind, macht das sehr viel Freude. Die Kamera lässt eigentlich nichts vermissen, ist schnell, kompakt, hat eine außerordentliche Bildqualität und stellt auch bei wenig Licht zuverlässig scharf. Man muss sich mit ihr beschäftigen, um ihre Fähigkeiten auszureizen, aber das ist bei anderen Kameras genauso. Mir als Fuji Fan gefällt zwar das Konzept nicht sonderlich gut, aber das muss jeder für sich entscheiden. Wenn Geld und ein bisschen mehr Gewicht keine Rolle spielt, dann würde ich mir die X-T4 auf alle Fälle mal ansehen. Für meine Verhältnisse ist das die beste Fuji Kamera.
Eine Empfehlung ist die X-S10 auf alle Fälle und auch eine der besten Kameras auf dem Markt in diesem Sektor und zu diesem Preis."
11955,1.0,
11956,1.0,"Es gibt so viele (Test-) Berichte und Vergleiche über und mit dieser Kamera. Eine weitere Spec-Schlacht ergibt da einfach keinen Sinn und würde keine echte Einschätzung zulassen, wie sich die Kamera im Alltag tatsächlich schlägt. Daher die aus meiner Sicht wichtigsten Punkte, die man über die X-S10 wissen sollte.

Handhabung:
Die Kamera ist angenehm kompakt, erst recht mit diesem Objektiv (XF 18-55mm 2.8-4.0 R LM OIS). Sie liegt durch ihren tiefen Handgriff sehr gut in der Hand. Man kann die Kamera mit dem Griff auch locker längere Zeit in der Hand halten, wenn man sie nicht mit dem Tragegurt trägt. Mit vergleichbaren Kameras anderer Hersteller taten mir so irgendwann die Finger weh.

Apropos Gurt: der ist angenehm schmal und sehr dezent. Nur ein kleiner weißer Schriftzug weißt im unteren (!) Teil des Gurtes auf die Marke hin. Also keine übertriebene Zurschaustellung der Marke. Top!

Bildqualität:
Ein erheblicher Mehrwert der X-S10 ggü. den Konkurrenten ist die Qualität der JPEGs. Die Kamera bietet die Möglichkeit, mit Filmsimulationen (im Prinzip sind das Farbprofile) sehr brauchbare JPEGs direkt aus der Kamera zu generieren. Natürlich muss man ein wenig Ausprobieren und Testen. Jeder Anwender einer Systemkamera steht aber nunmal vor der Frage: JPEG oder RAW? Ja, es geht auch beides, aber darum geht’s hier nicht. RAWs brauchen zu 99% Nacharbeit und sind zudem sehr groß. Die Nacharbeit kostet vor allem Zeit und Geld (z.B. für Lightroom). Hat man hingegen ein Gefühl für die JPEG-Möglichkeiten der Fuji bekommen, kann man einfach und schnell die Bilder nutzen und genießen (ohne, dass sie wochenlang auf Bearbeitung warten). Wer es besonders eilig hat kann schon auf dem Heimweg die Bilder per App aufs Smartphone übertragen und sofort bei Instagram posten. ;-) Übrigens bieten fast alle anderen Fujifilm-Kameras ebenfalls die Filmsimulationen und damit auch brauchbare JPEGs.

Unterstützt wird das Ganze durch einen wirklich sehr guten und rauscharmen Sensor, der zusätzlich auch noch stabilisiert ist (IBIS). Nur wenige Kameras bieten in diesem Preissegment eine vergleichbare Funktion. Verwendet man zusätzlich noch eines der stabilisierten OIS-Objektive von Fuji, kann man richtig gute Aufnahmen in dunklen Umgebungen aus der Hand (!) machen. Echt stark!

Bedienung:
Die X-S10 ist nicht die einfachste Kamera, keine Frage. Aber sie erschlägt den Nutzer auch nicht mit einer endlosen Liste an Funktionen. Die Bedienung erfordert etwas Einarbeitung. Hat man seine Konfiguration vorgenommen, geht das Fotografieren aber leicht und schnell von der Hand. Helfen tut dabei auch der praktische Blendenring an den Fuji-XF-Objektiven.

Objektiv:
Das Objektiv XF 18-55mm 2.8-4.0 R LM OIS ist eine sehr gute Allround-Ergänzung. Es ist optisch stabilisiert und besticht vor allem durch seine Größe und Verarbeitung. Im Prinzip ist es ein besseres Zoom-Objektiv ggü. der XC-Serie und sollte gewöhnlichen Ansprüchen mehr als genügen. Die Kamera passt damit sogar in eine größere Jackentasche. ;-) Für optische Besonderheiten (z.B. höhere Lichtstärke oder Sonnensterne) sollte man auf das etwas größere, aber auch teurere XF16-80mmF4 R OIS WR zurückgreifen, das es ebenfalls im Kit mit der X-S10 gibt.

Ein wesentlicher Kaufgrund für die X-S10 waren tatsächlich die Objektive, im Speziellen die von Fujifilm selbst. Im Verhältnis zu Canon oder Nikon gibt es auf dem Markt zwar deutlich weniger Fuji-Objektive von Drittanbietern (wie z.B. von Tamron), weniger ist hier allerdings nicht schlechter. Die Objektive von Fuji sind sehr gut, vor allem die XF-Serie. Für jeden Einsatzzweck gibt es mindestens ein Objektiv im mittleren Preissegment.

Fazit:
Die Kamera ist perfekt für Familien und Leute, die mit Systemkameras auf Tuchfühlung gehen wollen. Technisch lässt die X-S10 kaum Wünsche offen und bietet wirklich viel fürs Geld. Sie ist kompakt, wertig, durchdacht und bereitet (nach etwas Einarbeitung) richtig Freude am Fotografieren. Die JPEG-Fähigkeiten erlauben den schnellen Genuss der Bilder.

Fujifilm bietet zudem hochwertige Objektive. In jedem Fall rate ich zu einem XF-Objektiv, mag der Preis im ersten Moment auch hoch sein - es lohnt sich. Sehr empfehlenswert!"

11958,4.0,Present for my son......who tells me it's great
11959,5.0,"I bought this as an upgrade to my X-T30. Initially I was put off by the different controls from the traditional Fuji cameras, but having used it a few weeks now I actually find it easier to setup the camera to exactly how I want it. I mainly shoot in aperture priority and set up the C4 custom dial as my main profile as this is next to the video on the PASM dial, one click of the dial is a lot more convenient than turning half way round the dial.

In terms of image quality it is pretty much identical to the X-T30, that is, it’s excellent and has the same Fuji colours. The X-S10 does have one extra film simulation mode, Eterna bleach bypass, not something I’ve used, but I guess its still one more than the X-T30. What is useful over the X-T30 is that the film simulation menu now gives you more details about the film simulation and its intended use. These film simulations can also be applied to video which it can record in 4k/dci up to 30fps and 10x slow motion at 240fps in 1080p. Where the X-T30 had a record limit of only 10 minutes in 4k video, the X-S10 can record the industry standard 30 minutes of 4k.

Build quality is solid and feels better built than the X-T30 which was already pretty good. The handling is also so much better with the larger grip, something which the X-T30 was lacking even when fitted with a grip/L bracket. The X-S10 feels so much better in the hand and makes for easier one handed operation even with a heavier/larger lens. The touchscreen is the same size as the X-T30 but as it is also a flips out it makes it more versatile especially for low angle shots or for selfie/vlogging.

If vlogging or video shooting is what you do a lot the the 5-axis in body image stabilisation when paired with a lens with optical image stabilisation makes for a very smooth stabilised video. This can be further enhanced with the digital stabilisation function in camera though it will slightly crop the image when doing so. All the prime lenses for Fuji X mount do not have any form of stabilisation so the inclusion of I.B.I.S is a massive benefit if you shoot with prime lenses. It will allow you to shoot handheld video and longer shutter duration photos in low light situations.

To sum up the main benefits this camera has over the X-T30, they are the image stabilisation, the grip, the custom dial and the flip screen. It has everything all that you ever need for a hybrid shooter. But if there is one thing I do miss, it is the dial you get on the X-T30 that is sadly missing on the X-S10, the focus mode dial….."
11960,5.0,"Ich bin ein anspruchsvoller Urlaubs-Fotograf, d.h. ich lege Wert auf hochwertige Bilder, aber steige nicht bis in die tiefsten Tiefen der Kamera ein. Nachdem ich jahrelang SLRs von Nikon besaß, bin ich nun zu Fujifilm gewechselt, da ich deren Angebote für um die 1000 Euro am attraktivsten fand.

Was zuerst auffällt. auch gegenüber meinen früheren Nikons, ist die wertige Verarbeitung. Alles fühlt sich solide, langlebig, und nicht nach Plastikspielzeug an. Trotzdem ich große Hände haben lässt sich die Kamera dank des großen Griffes gut halten und bedienen. Dank des gegenüber anderen Fuji-Kameras geänderten Bedien-Konzeptes fällt die Umgewöhnung nicht schwer.

Gleichzeitig ist das Bedienkonzept mein Hauptkritikpunkt: es gibt eine riesige Auswahl an Einstellmöglichkeiten, sowohl im Menü an sich, als auch in der Belegung der Buttons/Tasten. Und da ist die UX einfach nicht gut. Zum einen hätte man das Menü in einen Einfach/Erweitert-Bereich splitten, zum anderen hätte man mehr Hilfen bei den oft kryptischen Bezeichnungen anbieten können. Auch das Quickmenü sollte nicht nur auf Icons basieren, sondern zusätzlich Labels aufweisen. Das wäre innerhalb des Menüs sicher darstellbar.
Sicher, man kann sich einarbeiten, aber es ginge besser.

Das trübt den Gesamteindruck aber nur minimal, denn hat man sich dort durchgequält - oder nimmt einfach die Auto-Einstellung - wird man mit brillianten Bildern belohnt, die aus der Kamera heraus hervorragend sind, und den Nachbearbeitungs-Aufwand erheblich reduzieren. Hier ist das Ergebnis erheblich besser als bei meiner vorherigen Nikon. Auch das Kit-Objektiv ist weit besser als das, was ich bisher gewohnt war.

Alles in allem eine sehr empfehlenswerte Kamera."
11961,4.0,
11962,5.0,"Fujifilm X-S10 with 16-80mm lens. There are several Fujifilm X series cameras to choose from. This has the latest of everything, with in body image stabilisation, the version 4 sensor and processing and the same lens options.

So, you get fantastic photos and Fujifilm’s amazing film simulation options for beautiful photo tone and colours without needing to learn editing software. All this is also true of other new models.

What sets the X-S10 apart is how easy it makes everything. It has a layout and control scheme the is more similar to other brands, taking a step away from the retro inspired manual controls of others in the range.

So, if having manual control of everything is something you don’t really want to worry about, but you still want the Fujifilm style and quality. This is the one to get.

I’ve had mine a month or more now, shooting about 3,000 images. All I can say is ‘wow’! What this camera can do is just ridiculous. The quality is incredible and the stabilisation allows hand held shots way after sunset. It’s nuts what you can get away with. So happy to have it."
11963,4.0,"Lo que hay que saber respeto a las cámaras fotográficas es que no hay cámara que sea perfecta. Siempre le encontraremos algún ""pero"" y seguramente la compararemos con nuestra cámara anterior. En mi caso vengo de una Samsung NX-500 que toma muy buenas fotos pero dejó de ser compatible a partir del iPhone XS y no pude conectarla más remotamente. Me ha costado bastante tiempo descubrir cuál era la cámara equivalente para reemplazarla. Me parece haber acertado con la Fujifilm X-S10, pues toma excelentes fotos. Estuve dudando en comprarla con el objetivo de 16-80 pero finalmente analicé para que la quería y primó más la ligereza y el poder llevarla cómodamente en el cuello sin que moleste (18-55 finalmente).
He añadido dos fotos de paisajes tomadas con esta cámara y los detalles y colores son increíbles. Es cierto que no en todas las situaciones se obtienen fotografías así y probablemente en algún momento se necesitará ajustar el contraste (bajarlo) con algún programa de edición.
La conexión con el móvil a través del programa Cam Remote es interesante pero me parece que necesita cierto desarrollo, ya que, en algunos casos, cuando quiero tomar fotos utilizando el móvil, la imagen se congela y tarda en conectarse. No me extraña porque he tenido otras cámaras que les pasaba algo similar. Espero que con alguna actualización mejoren este punto, que fue precisamente el que me motivó a cambiar de cámara.
Finalmente mi petición es para Amazon, para que controle a los falsos vendedores que pululan por aquí. En más de una ocasión he comprado productos y luego me han anulado la venta. Eso genera mucha frustración pues uno cree haber encontrado el producto deseado a un precio increíble y no es así."

11965,4.0,"Soyons honnête, le fujifilm XS-10 est un excellent boîtier. Il est très réactif et la prise en main est vraiment excellente (meilleure que sur certains full frame haut de gamme).

L'écran LCD complètement articulé et tactile est un bonheur à utiliser pour la photo de rue et contrairement à certains autres avis, le viseur électronique n'est pas du tout trop petit(même si l'on porte des lunettes).

Oui mais voilà, il comporte pour moi un défaut ""objectif"" et un défaut ""subjectif"".
Objectivement, la batterie se vide beaucoup trop vite. Le boîtier est parfait pour la photo de rue en terme de poids et d'ergonomie MAIS une après-midi de street photographie vous demandera d'emporter plusieurs batteries car leur autonomie est vraiment faiblarde (surtout en comparaison du récent XT-4 ou des hybrides Sony), ce qui est vraiment regrettable.

Enfin, et c'est la raison pour laquelle j'ai renvoyé ce boîtier à amazon, il faut être familier du ""rendu fujifilm"" qui donne un aspect ""argentique""/bruité/rugueux aux photos que l'on prend, photos qui me semblent manquer de netteté, clarté et d'éclat par rapport à ce qu'on obtient chez Nikon.

11968,5.0,"Ich muss Vorweg der Rezension von Herrn Stähle wiedersprechen. Ich kann beim besten Willen nicht verstehen, warum jemand ein Produkt mit 1 Stern bewertet, nur auf Grundlage einer fehlenden BDA?
Zumal auch die Aussage mzum Fujifilm Support nicht stimmt. Ich habe den Support per E-Mail angeschrieben und habe innerhabl von einer halben Stunde eine Rückmeldung samt deutscher Bedienungsanleitung als PDF Datei bekommen!
Auch kann man inzwischen auf der Homepage die BDA (auch in deutsch) kostenlos herunterladen. Somit sind seine Aussagen in seiner Rezension nicht wahr!

Zur Kamera und dem Objektiv. Alles in allem sehr erstklassig verarbeitet und macht sofort einen sehr hochwertigen Eindruck. Das Objektiv ist aus Metall und liegt sehr schön in der Hand. In Kombi mit der Kamera ist die Haptik sehr ausgewogen.

Bei der Kamera fällt sofort der Griff auf und es macht Spass die Kamera zu halten. Kein Vergleich zu anderen Kameras in ihrer Größe. Ich komme von Canon und die X-S10 entspricht in etwa der Canon EOS M5. Da kann sich Canon noch ein paar Scheiben abschneiden, was Materialien, Ausstattung und Preis-Leistungsverhältnis angeht.
Den Wechsel habe ich nicht bereut und es macht einfach Spass mit der Kamera zu arbeiten.

Auch der Retro-Look, für den Fujifilm bekannt ist, trifft genau meinen Geschmack. Die Bedienung ist sehr einfach, wenn man sich mit der Kamera vertraut gemacht hat. Das schöne bei Fuji ist, man kann alle Tasten und Bedienelemte nach seinen eigenen Wünschen konfigurieren. Das geht bei Canon nur sehr bedingt und auch hier hat Fuji deutlich die Nase vorn, was das Handling und den Workflow angeht.

Das schöne an der X-S10 ist, dass Fuji hier eine Brücke für Wechsler schlägt, durch sein geändertetes Bedienkozept. Mit dieser Kamera kommen Neueinsteiger von anderen Herstellern wie Sony, Canon oder Nikon sehr leicht zurecht.

Ich kann nur sagen, dass Fujifilm mit der X-S10 eine hochwertige Kamera an den Start gebracht hat, welche mit vielen Ausstattungsmerkmalen einer Highend-Kamera versehen ist und das zu einem Preis von knapp unter 1.000 Euro für den Body. Da kann man bei anderen Herstellern lange suchen, das gibt es einfach nicht."
11969,5.0,
11970,5.0,"Vorweg, die Kamera ist absolut empfehlenswert für Neueinstiger in die Fujiwelt. Ich bin ein großer Canon Fan und fotografiere überwiegend mit EOS R5 und R6 und den entsprechenden RF-Objektiven aus der L Serie. Warum also zusätzlich noch eine Fuji? Nun, im Gegensatz zur Vollformat ist sie wirklich sehr handlich und ich bekomme alle meine Objektive in eine kleine Fototasche. Ich kann die Kamera also überall mitnehmen, wo ich sonst meine Canons zuhause liegen lassen würde.
Zu Beginn war ich noch unschlüssig, ob ich die Kamera behalten sollte. Die ersten Ergebnisse mit dem (wirklich guten) Kitobjektiv waren ernüchternd und hatten mich nicht überzeugt. Mein Hauptbereich ist die Portraitfotografie und da bin ich es gewohnt sehr offenblendig zu fotografieren. Und das geht mit so einem Kitobjektiv eben nicht.
Allerdings hatte ich mir die Kamera ja für andere Einsatzzwecke zugelegt und da hat sie mich wirklich überzeugt. Für Landschaftsaufnahmen oder Architektur ist das Kitobjektiv wirklich fantastisch. Eine sehr hochwertige Optik im Gegensatz zu den Kitobjektiven, die man üblicherweise so bekommt.
Ich habe mir mittlerweile noch weitere Objektive zugelegt und mit einem 35mm f/0,95 bekomme ich sogar den Look hin, den ich bei Vollformat gewohnt bin.
Die Bedienung der Kamera ist sehr intuitiv und es fiel mir leicht auch ohne Bedienungsanleitung loszulegen."
11971,5.0,
11972,5.0,Top Produkt. Wird für Tierfotografie an einem 100-400 mit 2x Converter genutzt. Mit gecroppten 1200mm perfekt. Leider herstellerseitig nicht spritzwassergeschützt und auch einen Punkt Abzug für die Augenmuschel und den Trageriemen. Beides habe ich mir von Drittanbietern gekauft - leider können die es besser.
11973,5.0,
11974,5.0,"Diese Kamera geht einen anderen Weg als andere Modelle von Fuji. Das ist mutig, da Fuji Fanboys das klassische Bedienkonzept vermissen werden und man damit rechnen kann, dass die Kamera deswegen bei einigen als mega uncool gelten wird. Die XT3 z.B. wird immer ästhetisch vorne sein und ist jetzt schon ein modern classic. Die X-S10 ist dagegen just another camera und wird irgendwann vergessen sein. Obwohl sie technisch ja absolut ebenbürtig ist.

Besondere Vorsicht ist jetzt geboten in der Auswahl, weil die XT3 derzeit Ende 2020 mit Fuji Cash Back genauso teuer ist, aber eigentlich hochwertiger gebaut ist (Die XT3 ist wetterfest und hat den besseren Sucher!!). Nun - dafür hat die X-S10 IBIS, ist kleiner und hat diesen genialen Griff. Aber da die Fuji Coolness ein wenig wegfällt, muss man natürlich schon überlegen, ob die viel günstigere Nikon Z50 nicht die bessere Wahl ist. Die hat nämlich auch einen richtigen Griff - im Gegensatz zu den anderen Fujis.

Also: Tolle Kamera, aber man muss sich gut überlegen, ob man das wirklich so will... Ich denke mit der XT3 wäre ich zufriedener, aber die XS10 ist so eine schöne kleine point and shoot Kamera und man möchte einfach nur in full Auto damit Bilder machen. Trotzdem : Ich denke der Hype vor release war nicht gerechtfertigt. Ob IBIS das killer feature ist... ich denke nicht.

Update: Nach einigen Tagen mit der Kamera bleibe ich dabei: Es geht um schnelle, unkomplizierte und herausragende Fotos mit zeitgemäßem Video. Manuelle Sachen gehen zwar alle, gehen aber nicht so flott von der Hand. Für manuelle Ambitionen und das klassische Kameragefühl hat Fuji andere tolle Kameras. Letztlich für mich der Griff der ausschlaggebende Punkt und die wunderschönen Bilder, die man mit einer Einfachheit macht, die man gar nicht mehr missen will."

11976,4.0,"Lo mejor de las cámaras Fuji son los JPEGs, con otras marcas tienes que usar RAW y luego echarle horas con un programa avanzado para obtener resultados similares. Los colores son geniales y no tiene nada de colores falsos incluso a ISO 12800.
Como pasa con todas las cámaras digitales, la configuración por defecto no aprovecha todas sus posibilidades. En mi opinión hay que activar el DR-P (arregla muy bien los contraluces y no tiene efectos negativos en otros casos) y poner la reducción de ruido al mínimo (hay más ""granos"" de ruido pero son más finos y se mantienen mucho mejor los detalles).

El 18-55 es muy rápido enfocando y al grabar video con el micro de la cámara no se oye para nada. Otra ventaja es que no cambia de focal al enfocar.

A diferencia de otras Fuji, los controles de la cámara son ""modernos"" (parecidos al resto de marcas) y a mí me parecen bastante más cómodos y configurables (5 botones y una rueda) que los ""clásicos"". Otra ventaja es la empuñadura que permite usar la cámara con una mano (la derecha)."

Yo tengo una Canon 5D con objetivos L, sé lo que es la calidad y esta cámara cumple muy bien en todo tipo de situaciones. Muy versatil con la pantalla táctil y articulada. El visor electrónico también aporta buenas prestaciones pues puedes ver en el momento todos los ajustes que haces, por ejemplo de exposición.
Los objetivos son muy ligeros y es un equipo que puedes llevar a todos lados.

La qualita' delle immaggini e' ottima anche in JPEG, grazie alle simulazioni pellicola e ad una vasta gamma di settaggi disponibili.

Il mio utilizzo principale e' il video, e devo dire che se la cava egregiamente. La stabilizzazione del sensore aiuta molto, anche con l'utilizzo di lenti senza OIS.
Il grip piu' grande rispetto alle altre fuji permette di effettuare riprese a mano con piu' sicurezza.

12043,5.0,"I got this camera after seeing rave reviews in YouTube. However, this review will focus on the shortcomings only. I discovered after 10 days of use.
1. Poor battery life : does not last even 3 hours of use. However, this is compensated by the extra battery provided. But the way battery compartment is designed does no good to the purpose. you need to unscrew from mount to change The battery. So you will need to break your schedule in case u are shooting something continuous.
2. Error Error - the dreaded E:62:10 error appeared in my camera after few days of use. Although I did not face any difficulty in shooting. It did make my experience bitter. Could not resolve though the solutions available on internet. The usual switch on of. Change battery etc does not work and the error message is a part of the display now.
3. Mic : even tough the mic is a strong one. It does not do well to reduce background noise.
4. Charging time : 150 mins. This really restricts ur ability to shoot and u need to plan ahead if you are a serious vlogger.
5. Not weather proof. : the manual says it is not weather proof and small amounts of water may damage the internal circuits. I mean why? It restricts your ability to take outdoor shoot and a vlogger would not take this.

Apart from the above. The camera delivers what it promises in the review videos.

Update :
My lens assembly was faulty. Thankfully Sony service centre was open and as directed by the Sony representative, I gave the camera for repair. It took 14 days to get the part from abroad and complete the repairs. Now, the camera is working fine. No issues as such.
Update 2: Please go through the settings and understand each setting before shooting. There are a lot of helpful YouTube videos on this camera.
Update 3 : The camera worked fine for 2 days after repairs. As of now it is still in the repair shop. 2 months after purchase the camera is 28 days.(and counting) in repair shop. Even after 2 trips of repair shop the error does not go away. Now it is a permanent display in my camera.
Update 4: Sony had finally replaced the camera with a new one. Will update if there are issues in the new one. From mid September to mid December the camera was in the repair centre for at least 50 days before it was finally replaced."
12044,4.0,"Q. Is it worth 54k?
No, should have been around 40k given that it's from ""2020"" & 2023 is almost here.

Yes, if you're a little experienced & No, if you're a first timer, so make sure you watch those tutorials first.

Q. Is it good for social media & especially YT?
Yes! A 100%.

I liked the camera! Not the price tho!

12045,5.0,"Like all modern sony cameras, you gotta know to a certain extent what you're doing to get the most out of the cameras. To be fair, this applies to all cameras including smartphone cameras, but that's beside the point.
Anyway, this camera was released about 2 years ago at the time of me writing this. I bought it for someone else, as if fit the budget and it has all the features that they'll need. I did have a day to test it out and the TLDR is that it's a very easy recommendation for anyone who wants a compact camera that can take excellent stills and videos but doesn't need a huge zoom range.

My primary digital camera is a sony a6600, and the zv-1 has a very similar image quality to that. Both in viseo and photo modes. The a6600 of course has more dynamic range and better low light but that camera also costs a little over twice as much as this one and both serve different demographics.

The zv-1 has an adequately fast (i.e. wide aperture) lens with equivalent focal length of 24-70mm, which is a solid range for most things. The lens is sharp throughout the zoom range and has very little defacts (defacts as in chromatic aberration, distortion, vignette etc.).

The video quality is excellent. If you know your way around any NLE, I'd recommend shooting in 4k @100mbps always and with a custom picture profile with gamma set to s-log2 and gamut set to itu709. Set detail to the lowest possible value (-7). That, i find, to be the optimal setting for the low bitrate 8bit footage. If you don't want to do post processing, perhaps I'd suggest using no picture profile but turning up DRO to max.

The cons would include a very short battery life. However, the camera can be powered indefinitely with a power bank. I reckon it's an acceptable tradeoff for the tiny footprint of the camera. Speaking of which, you might also wanna get a strap for it as it doesn't come with one and if you have bigger hands like i do, there's definitely a risk of it falling.

I didn't have time to do super thorough tests, but from what I've seen, I think I can easily recommend this camera to anyone who wouldn't mind the limitations of it. The primary limitations being a smaller sensor size, fixed lens and a small battery.

Oh, and it doesn't have a flash built in but I kinda prefer not having a built in flash because i never use it and it's just one more thing waiting to break."

There are few things I wish they need to improve on immediate effect in next version.
1) Microphone needs improvement so much noise comes in have to buy additional accessories to cut down noise
2) Battery 🔋 can't even hold a month if not using. Once I charge the device to full capacity it doesn't last a month on stand by. In case of emergency shoot it is not a good companion
3) Bag to hold camera and gear
4) Price if possible as I had to spend 10000 to get a microphone
5) Little rugged and waterproof so that I can ditch my go pro and carry this all alone"
12065,5.0,Battery life is lil less but ither than that i think its amazing 😍
12066,5.0,"Good light weight 4K camera. Good still photography as well excellent 4K videos too. Cons, sound is too less when watching the videos on camera and battery life is too bad, it comes with 2 batteries so you need to keep other one on charge when using for shots

Also I felt it is Little bit expensive for what it deserves. Price should be 8-10k less but overall it does the job, good autofocus and background defocus"
12067,5.0,"Best camera you can buy as a content creator!

I always confused between Canon m50 or Sony ZV1. Atleast choose the ZV1. Because of these resons,
1. Great Autofocus ( Very very useful. Sony cameras are very reliable)

2. Quality (Sony smashed Canon)

3. Less croped, usable 4k recording ( As compared to m50)

4. Low light capability (Much much better than m50)

5. Value for money ( I calculted overall cost to get the same things from M50, and it cost more than ZV1)

But, yes there have two major drawbacks,
1. Battery (Yes you'll get more battery life in m50 compared to ZV1)

2. 24mm lens ( I think 16mm is the best lens for vlogging and you can buy one for M50. For ZV1, yes it's 24mm is wide but not as much as you need for vlogging.)

Conclusion - If you need Quality, reliability and compactability just like me, this is the camera you need.

No other camera on the market can beat it in this price point."

there is only 2 very minor issues that i suffered from
1;- battery life it does not long last if you do vlogging i would recommend you getting a extra battery
2;- lense is not interchangeable (the built in lense kit is good infact really awesome but interchangeable lenses gives a creator flexibility)"

I checked out several youtube video on this camera to find out if this is normal.

So, how do i exchange this camera for a new one? Thank you. Please help"

Battery life and wide angle lens..but both are resolvable
In short very happy with this camera👍"

Best for vlogging or youtube."
12120,3.0,"Like- Video quality and focusing.
Dislike- Poor battery backup, Poor image quality, not value for money"
12121,5.0,"So i have been using this Beast For Almost 2 Months Now And Tbh Im Loving it Especially The AF Of This Camera is Really Awesome and the quality it gives is just amazing for a point and shoot camera almost directly comparable to DSLRs worth 100k+ inr
there is only 2 very minor issues that i suffered from
1;- battery life it does not long last if you do vlogging i would recommend you getting a extra battery
2;- lense is not interchangeable (the built in lense kit is good infact really awesome but interchangeable lenses gives a creator flexibility)"
12122,5.0,"Award winning Autofocus Sony lens alongwith rotating screen with Background Defocus what can u expect more on a camera for Vlogging.

Pros :-
Compact
Ease to operate
Background defocus

Best for new YT creator with budget and also for Pro YT for review videos.
I am happy with the investment... Must have for videos and photos...
No phone can match this camera clarity"
12123,3.0,"The box was tempered/opened
Seems like used camera"
12124,5.0,Very bad battery life in this product and only one battery pack received. All other things are good
12125,5.0,I have bought this product after watching 50 plus youtube reviews still i got fooled by all their color graded contents. This camera is not even an alternative to GoPro 10. I have GoPro 10 and 5d mark iv i just looked for a portable camera and i am in confusion with m50 mark ii but this camera isn't upto mark in any thing either in video or camera. My rating is only about camera performance and not about the delivery or the condition of the product
12126,3.0,"If you r in the market for a small camera , just don't look at anything else!
Because there is none in the market which can even come close to this....
Just go for it!"
12127,4.0,Not user friendly
12128,5.0,"The camera works great and is good for amateurs, but the piece I got doesn’t have the 3.5mm mic jack working.. that’s a real downer :(

In the midst of this Covid situation it’s so difficult, now I have to visit the Sony centre to get it replaced"
12129,2.0,"Very good camera for vlogging, best AF in the business.
Very compact and light.
Very good video recording capabilities.
No phone sensor can beat this video quality.
Very good audio quality

Negatives:
But pricey
Battery life could have been better"
12130,4.0,"i bought this sony zv1 few weeks ago. i have not been using it much since i am down with covid 19. However, on few indoor usage there is a line scratch on the lens. I checked out several youtube video on this camera to find out if this is normal. But nothing of this sort is found on any other camera. the scratch seems to have gotten when the lens pushes out and pulls in when the camera is turn on and off. So, how do i exchange this camera for a new one? Thank you. Please help"
12131,4.0,"Everything thing is good,camera is very easy to use,quality is very good no problem,but the man problem is battery , battery is very poor only 1 hr backup for normal use ,and take 3 to 4 hr for charging it's very frustrating to change 4 hr and use only one hr......."
12132,5.0,This camera is allrounder
12133,5.0,Very low noise. Superb colours from the Zeiss glass. Flippable screen. Records high quality audio. So light to carry and the sony tripod is excellent. The battery performance is pathetic. Taking out the SD cards is impossible to take out when fixed in stand. Takes poor photographs. If Sony addresses these issues they will have a perfect vlogging camera for us.
12134,4.0,All i can say the delivery was good..I am new to cameras so i can't give proper review but i am learning and loving it.it is very handy and small.
12135,5.0,"Cons:
Poor battery life.
4K recording limit : 5mins
Automatic shuts down shooting when camera gets high temperature.
Not wide enough.

Pros:
High Quality Images and Videos.
Easy to use.
Light weight. 290gms
Smaller than my smartphone.
Nice audio recording. Better than Rode Shotgun mic.
Natural skin tones."
12136,4.0,"I have purchased early morning on the launch date, received the next day under Prime one day delivery!
The box comes with camera, Bluetooth grip, 64gb memory card, two batteries, wind screen and usb cable which makes it a complete package.
First impression on quality is good. I was searching for pocket sized compact light weight camera capable to take DSLR quality photo/video and this one solves the purpose.
Follow the attached image how small it is holding within the palm!"
12137,5.0,"Good camera but not a perfect camera.
Slightly over priced and image stabilization is not good. If you want to see full review with video samples,you can see on
Dr Kalpana singh YouTube channel."
12138,5.0,"It's a awesome camera for vlogging and very comfortable. But my tripod stopped working with the camera aftr a month, may be battery or cell which we use for tripod has expired.
But camera is 100 % value for money."
12139,5.0,Best Vlogging cam in mid ranges you definitely go with it... i'm Happy to buy it.
12140,5.0,"Cool stuff!!
Just changed my feedback without any askin.
One should go for this camera if they want to vlog on the go.
Order again"
12141,3.0,"Within a month of purchase, this osmo pocket 2 showed very bad software glitch. There is only one service centre in India. I have to courier this to them. This is a very bad experience. I am never going to buy any DJI product until they have a good service in India."
12142,5.0,"I am writing this review after using it for 2 months.
First of all,this is an amazing little beast whose stability is insanely mind blowing. Though I have purchased the standard one, but it's a complete value for money deal. Came with proper cushioning support for the 3-axis gimbal under a housing case,a type c power cable, attachable controllers and a strap. Gimbal is almost similar to what they use for drones (mavic series),so you can expect better quality images and videos. There are three kind of modes for using the gimbal i .e. FPV, Follow and Tilt lock. Each mode gives different ways of recording your videos. But I mostly prefer the FPV mode. There are bunch of options for recording your videos,from 4K to 1080p,but 1080p looks beautiful anyway. You can also take photos at 64 megapixels and that's huge. The view angle is 110° which is quite good enough for vlogging by covering maximum background or foreground. Battery life depends on what settings you are shooting. But expect longer enough if you shoot at 1080p resolution. However the battery is not removal but charging is really fast. Also you can use it while power bank plug in.
But let me clarify one thing that don't compare this with Go Pro action camera. Because pocket 2 is solely made for smooth cinematic videos,not for high action footages. Also, keep in mind that pocket 2 is not water proof or weather resistant like go pros and hence you can't shoot anything in bad rainy weather. However you can buy water proof case separately. One big advantage of pocket 2 is that it has 1/1.7"" sensor, which means you can get good results even in low light conditions.
Summarily, if you are big fan of adventure or moto vlog buy go pro,and if you just want to vlog and shoot slow cinematic footages and prefer to use in low light then pocket 2 is for you.
Cheers!
EDIT: It's almost a year now of using my pocket 2. So following are my review:
1. Excellent in terms of UI. Easy to understand everything (dji is best for UI).
2. Screen size could be bigger.
3. Excellent build quality.
4. Almost more than 1 and half hour 1080 p recording limit. (Nearly 1 hr in 4K).
5. Easy dual face gimbal. Thus, excellent for vlogging."
12143,5.0,"PROS :
1. ULTRA COMPACT
2. WOULD HARDLY OCCUPY ANY SIZE IN YOUR BAG WHILE TRAVELLING
3. SHOOTS 4K-60FPS | D-CINELIKE FLAT COLOR IS THERE (WOULD ONLY MAKE SENSE TO SERIOUS VIDEO EDITORS, WHO PROFER COLOR GRADING THEIR FOOTAGE LATER IN POST..LIKE I DO AS WELL )
4. PRO MODE IN VIDEO | LOTS OF FRAME RATES AND RESOLUTIONS TO PLAY WITH.

CONS :
1. GETS SUPER HOT IN 4K60FPS..
2. COMMON DJI PROBLEMS (AS FOUND IN DJI FORUMS AS CROSS CHECKED) ARE -
ONCE YOU START THIS UPNFOR THE FIRST TIME, IT WOULD ASK FOR FIRMWARE UPDATE AND POST THAT - (A) CAMERA WOULD SWITCH ON TO SELFIE MODE ONLY (CAM FACING USER) WITH THE NORMAL POWER BUTTON. TO GET IT ON IN NORMAL WAY ...YOU NEED TO PRESS AND HOLD THE MODE BUTTON FOR A SECOND AND CAMERA SPRINGS BACK ON TO NORMAL MODE (CAM FACING AWAY FROM USER).

2. NEXT UP, WHAT WOULD HAPPEN FOR SURE, IS CAMERA WOULD BARELY RECORD FOR 13-19 SECONDS AND STOP RECORDING. TO THIS PROBLEM, I TRIED ALL FIXES AS SUGGESTED IN THE DJI FORUM, BUT STILL NO LUCK FOR MY UNIT AT LEAST)

3. BATTERY LIFE IS BELOW AVERAGE IN 4K 60FPS ..MAY BE BETTER IN LOWER RESOLUTIONS.

ADDITIONAL POINTS -
1. APP THAT YOU NEED - DJI MIMO
2. BE EXTRA CAREFUL WHILE SLIDING THE DEVICE OUT OF THE SUPPLIED CARRIAGE POD. THERE IS A HIGH CHANCE YOU WOULD PRESS AND HOLD THE POWER BUTTON OR THE PHOTO SHUTTER BUTTON WHICH WOULD POWER THE CAMERA AND THE GIMBAL WOULD ATTEMPT TO ROTATE IN HIGH SPEED IN THE POD AND THAT CAN EASILY DAMAGE THE UNIT.

HOPE THESE POINTERS HELP EVERYONE INTERESTED."
12144,4.0," Ok many reasons not impressed with the decision that I made for to buy this product.
I had seen many reviews before going for it.
It got delivered yesterday and on the second day I had to talk with customer care as you can see in the video that on the gimbal head, one side is kind of oil and other side it seems fine.
2nd issue my phone battery gets charged while connecting with pocket2, this way the pocket2 battery gets drained and I am out of time to shoot my video.
While testing, shooting some 2 to 3 video clips as a trial, the pocket2 heats up like feelings of the battery might explode.
It might be I, got the damaged product which was sitting around somewhere in the warehouse for 2 years.
I have spoken with customer care and related the issues and they have assured me of replacement which will take a week from now. It feels very bad and disappointment when you lose your time after along wait and when you get issues for what you had paid for?"
12145,4.0,This is the one thing i am 100% satisfied with in my whole lifetime. Every vlogger should have this in their pocket. Don't under estimate the power of this small camera.

12147,5.0,Good for outdoors and good lighting conditions not ideal for indoors and too grainy in low light low light I mean tube lights and decor ceiling lights.
12148,2.0,Tell you after travel.
12149,4.0,Great camera for personal use. Donot have professional video quality. You might need filters when shooting under sunlight.
12150,4.0,This is my first video camera. No doubt it captures amazing videos and the best part is the gimbal. I would prefer this anyday over a gopro. The only thing which bothere me is the price difference and the Do it all handle unavailability in India if u dont get the creator combo which sucks. Apart from that i love the lil camera and its features.

Heats up very quickly, very hot to hold it for long time during blogging"
12152,4.0,Why I didn't even buy this earlier ?!! Is so good and and is so easy to carry anywhere. Video stabilization is so awesome . If your hand is shaking too badily still in video it won't see . Clarity is good .. loved it !!

12158,4.0,Every thing ok but in amazon price too much high. Market price 27k only....... Go for authentic store and get right price
12159,5.0,This is a pretty solid video camera. It has a perfect field of view (equivalent to 20mm on a 35mm film lens). Heats up a little while shooting in 4K but is a pretty sweet device overall!

12162,4.0," I am not an impulsive buyer, i do a lot of research before i buy. I am into serviced apartment business TrustedStay.com , i used professional camera Nikon 7200 A for taking pictures and videos of the properties pan India. And travelling with your professional equipment was always a pain at airport and had to manage an extra luggage while traveling.

As the camera in phones improved i bought Samsung note 9 to replace my professional camera Nikon and trust me it was a relief, no more carrying of extra baggage and the pictures and videos were good enough for my website. There was a limitation of wide angle with Samsung note 9 So i bought a One Plus 9 pro and voila i could mange excellent shots of small rooms in mumbai service apartments. And for videos i bought a manfrato mobile holder see the picture. Soon i realised the manfrato mobile holder was a bit big for my trouser pocket. So i started eyeing at pocket gimble camera.

Today i have that and here are the benefits that i now see, just in 1day after purchase

1) I used ""Tilt locked"" mode (watch video) and while taking videos the interior walls and door are verticle to frame which was not possible with manfrato and phone mounted assembly. Basic requirements in videos of interior.

2) the colour were better that the phone video

3) the best part was the cinematic stable videos which were stable and not possible with mobile

4) So compact that i can easily carry in my trouser pocket

5) and lastly the wide angle 20 mm focal length in pocket 2 gave me in extra wide view compared to my One Plus 9 pro mobile which has 23 mm focal length

I think my first impression about the product was a good buy. Will share my views maybe 6 months later when i start using the DJI pocket 2 gimbal"

1) I used ""Tilt locked"" mode (watch video) and while taking videos the interior walls and door are verticle to frame which was not possible with manfrato and phone mounted assembly. Basic requirements in videos of interior.

2) the colour were better that the phone video

3) the best part was the cinematic stable videos which were stable and not possible with mobile

4) So compact that i can easily carry in my trouser pocket

5) and lastly the wide angle 20 mm focal length in pocket 2 gave me in extra wide view compared to my One Plus 9 pro mobile which has 23 mm focal length

I think my first impression about the product was a good buy. Will share my views maybe 6 months later when i start using the DJI pocket 2 gimbal"
12198,2.0,Good product to buy
12199,4.0,I have opened the dji pocket 2 today. It was gifted to my wife. The MINI CONTROL STICK is missing in the pack. What next to do??? Pls inform
12200,4.0,Worst quality worst stabilization.....
12201,3.0," I am not an impulsive buyer, i do a lot of research before i buy. I am into serviced apartment business TrustedStay.com , i used professional camera Nikon 7200 A for taking pictures and videos of the properties pan India. And travelling with your professional equipment was always a pain at airport and had to manage an extra luggage while traveling.

As the camera in phones improved i bought Samsung note 9 to replace my professional camera Nikon and trust me it was a relief, no more carrying of extra baggage and the pictures and videos were good enough for my website. There was a limitation of wide angle with Samsung note 9 So i bought a One Plus 9 pro and voila i could mange excellent shots of small rooms in mumbai service apartments. And for videos i bought a manfrato mobile holder see the picture. Soon i realised the manfrato mobile holder was a bit big for my trouser pocket. So i started eyeing at pocket gimble camera.

Today i have that and here are the benefits that i now see, just in 1day after purchase

12202,4.0,Good product to buy
12203,5.0,We like the camera and it's accesories. I clicked some photos underwater and they turned out really great!
12204,5.0,"Cost wise It's excellent.
Very good quality of VDO.
On bike, and in car.
I just love it!"
12205,4.0,"Completely satisfied with the purchase. This was my first purchase in terms of action cam and this didn't disappoint me at all.
Video stabilization and picture quality are two things which I loved on this camera. Also, the minimalist design made me fall in love with it. Last but not the least, it comes with so many accessories that it is highly adaptable in terms of setting the camera on your bike, helmet or chest strap.
Thank you, Procus!!"
12206,5.0,"It worked good enough for me, being a beginner. I used it in a race car.
It would switch off when it got too hot and start back up again.
The video duration it records is only 18 minutes"
12207,5.0,The camera runs well and can capture good video at 1080p which is suitable for a dashcam incase of emergency. However the 4k feature of the camera depletes the batteries quickly and can record for a maximum period of 30 minutes. The picture quality is good also. The sound capturing is decent. It's excellent for a beginner to get this camera.
12208,4.0,"The camera performs as advertised… video on review on laptop doesn’t have tearing from low resolution and high compression. Nice 4k videos. Photo feature is disappointing but u wont be using it for photos anyway. Mounting to bike and creating amazing ride videos.

Only thing left to desire is battery life. Gives about 60-70 min in one charge. I found once charged keep the battery out of camera and u’ll get full bath when most needed. And powerbank is must if u are vlogging!"
12209,5.0,Camera is good quality and 4k video resolution need extra mic jack will be the best

The ONLY problem I had was resolved after reading comments on a youtube video so I'm putting it here. When connecting to the XDV app, MAKE SURE YOUR PHONE DATA IS TURNED OFF otherwise it will not work. As soon as I did this it worked PERFECTLY and the remote recording was great. Best action camera"
12230,2.0,At this price it is really a great product. Image quality is nice and stability really working at its good. But the manual given application was vanished from Google Play Store. Please let the customer know about upgraded procus application in Google Play Store.. thanks

12236,1.0,The only thing is the wifi connectivity with the phone and transferring files fails if the size is big. Rest the money paid for the product is pretty decent and can not expect more..
12237,1.0,It's wide angle is very awsome video quality is also best that we get action camera in this price just take its spare batteries for more fun and durable and all over its is best
12238,4.0,"Starting with good bits: For this price range, it delivers quite a good amount of performance in terms of usability and build quality. The images' crispiness is moderate as it captures everything in wide angle which i feel acceptable although the video on other hand is simply superb, 4K recording godlike! I was using it intermittently on 720p 30fps which resulted in long battery reserve of around 3 1/2 hours. Idle battery reserves for more than 3 days (not sure, though) The package does comes with all the necessary accessories and user manual. Thus, one can say, good things can come in small package! Coming to the compromises: Unfortunately, Viper model doesn't support external mic, so you can guess how the audio quality will be! The helmet mount that comes with ain't curvy enough to be stuck on it, and i was talking to one of the Procus executive regarding that, they said, one can buy specific helmet mount from their official website. Finally the dashcam holder/mirror mount (whichever we call it) doesn't have commendable vibration isolation."
12239,5.0, Best camera for beginners. I had replaced the product for 1st time bcoz mic wasn't working 2nd time accessories wasn't good but I wasnt able to replace again kindly help me with exchanging the accessories.
12240,1.0,"It is a best product in this rate. I used this product to shoot my youtube Experiment videos and it works very smooth. In adventurous keede YouTube channel you can check it's camera quality and it's video results. It captures an extraordinary video in slow mode. Some where its camera quality is less when we used it in driving . It's driving mode is also superb fantastic. For a beginner this camera 📸 is wonderful. I made a review on this camera on Devil Tech Tips YouTube channel. It's a very good camera in its range. Hope higher model will also have that much capable.
Thank you so much Procus company for giving value for this product in this range"
12241,1.0,"Its good for beginners..but that good..u don't get an audio jack.. U have to put an external mic by using an micro USB adapter. Which cost 450 to 500 and mic for 300 to 500.
Inshot if u want if just for a normal use u van use it..but for a advance use I think it will not satisfy your expectations."
12242,4.0,"Have been using the Procus Viper action camera for about 3 months now. Have used it mainly while cycling and have tried it while mounted to the helmet and the cycle as well.

Stability is good in both cases and the quality of video recorded is good. Sound captured is satisfactory and the number of attachments/accessories is more than enough for all your daily needs. The only minus for me is the battery but for an action camera, 40-45 minutes of continuous usage time is absolutely fine at this point.

Will definitely be looking at purchasing one of the Procus dashcams in the near future. Happy with my purchase so far, lets see how it goes down the road!!"
12243,5.0,"After going thru many reviews, finally I bought this action cam. I am completely satisfied with the product with its wireless option. With this price tag and all accessories, it's an awesome product to bet on."
12244,3.0,It's picture quality is really good for the price. Unfortunately it doesn't work with a drone. The weight is too much along with the case.

12245,5.0,It's a very good camera for vlog it's best for the beginners so no problem you can choose this procus viper for vlogging

12302,5.0,Useful for beginers but very basic model no external mic its basic sd card type some sd cards correpted short duration. Good zooming nice clarity
12303,5.0,"Easy to use camcorder, we can easily carry this device while traveling and USB for easy charging using Power Banks. Features are limited and some settings can be manually adjusted which I really liked. The stereo audio clarity and quality is Very Good.

Note: There are different varients in CX-405 model this I came to know while discussing with Sony Tech support. This model does not have 60i / 60p frame rate.

I taught it will have FH option and tried it with SanDisk Xtream (64 GB) Class 10 micro SD and It did not show up the FH 60i / 60p options.

Hope this review is helpful and one more thing it has only 1 year warranty not two years as advertised.

This product is manufactured in China.Got the free bag with original packaging and accessories.

12304,3.0,Nice. But the plastic quality of this handycam shoule be more improved.
12305,4.0,"The display screen of the camcorder is too small, so the user gets only a vague idea of the environment while viewing through the LCD. Also, if we increase the zoom beyond a particular level, the quality of the picture reduces accordingly. And, there is no Memory Card and Carry Case in the packed box I have received, a similar experience to my recent purchase of the Canon EOS M200 Camera from Amazon, where there was no memory card and carry case in that box also !!"
12306,5.0,Good performance
12307,5.0,I LIKE THIS PRODUCT.
12308,2.0,This cam lo quality
12309,3.0,"Purchased this camcorder with trust in Sony brand. But the experience was very bad. First I received an old/used camera with scratch marks and faded paint. Asked for a replacement which was sent by Amazon. Again faced the similar experience. This time the camera was looking new but failed to turn ON. The Sony box which contains the camera looked brand new with a proper seal but on closer examination it created doubt about the seal. The seal on the box looked like it wasn't sealed in factory. Not expected from either Sony or Amazon. If you are selling recycled/refurbished products or repacking it outside factory please mention that it is a refurbished product and not a new. Moreover before dispatching to customer please check the condition of products that you are selling.

Finally purchased this camera from the famous ""camera gully"" in Mumbai at a very discounted price."
12310,5.0,"Recently I bought the Sony hdr cx 405 and i am really satisfied with the picture quality, to me it is nearly or identical with the higher range biger camcorder out there, coz. I am using this product for YouTube videos, one thing I am not comfort with this product is, since, this is a small sensor camera so found very hard to make a blurry background, otherwise, wight excellent, worth buying."
12311,4.0,"I don't receive 1. USB Connection Support Cable, 2. USB AC adapter, 3. Micro SD Card,4. Rechargeable Battery Pack.
Though original product is good, supplier had not supplied above mentioned things. So think before u order."
12312,5.0,"As an entry level camcorder it's a good product. Easy to use and the default mic is fantastic.
Only drawback is, in the selling information it was said sdcard is part of the deal but it is actually not, as can be seen in the adjoining photo of the box. Carrying case was provided. Amazon should refrain from misleading the customer in this way."
12313,3.0,Bit expensive...... it shld be max 15k not more than that
12314,5.0,very clear picture and shooting
12315,4.0,Average
12316,4.0,Today I got delivery of Sony HDRCX405 handycam camcorder but the micro SD Card is missing in box please help
12317,4.0,"Good Picture Quality for picture mode - Dimensions: 4032 x 2272 350dpi
HD Video so good (XAVCHD, AVCHD) outdoor day shoot very well & in build zoom mic is good..."
12318,3.0,Product is good But box is already opened.I think someone has been used before. In box all things are used.
12319,5.0,This is a handy product for outdoors. For indoor use I do not recommend this. If you know to take photos in a dslr then probably you will not like the video quality. Low light videos are absolutely grainy because of ISO management. But all in all iknda okay.
12320,3.0,Did not recive cover and SD card as mention while purchasing
12321,4.0,Video quality is nice 1080 pixels nice I like it
12322,4.0,"Pros:
- Very easy to use
- Battery Life is good, around 1 hour 15 minutes of Recording (which is a lot for casual use)
- Manual controls are there if required
- Compact and lightweight
- GREAT optical stabilization (better than any smartphone)
- Absolutely no complaints about video and audio quality. It will not be DSLR like, but this is not a professional camera. Its primary use is to quickly capture moments of time which you can cherish forever.

Cons:
- Manual controls are very cumbersome to use
- Camera turns off if you close the screen module
- Interface to playback the recorded videos is slow and complex. Better just copy the files to your PC and watch.

Other things to note:
- Good quality videos (1080p50) take a lot of storage space. Get atleast 64GB card for this.
Also make sure you have enough space on your hard drives because they will be filling fast if you shoot regularly.
(Though you can save a lot of space by converting the videos to a lower bit rate at the cost of video quality and your CPU's time)
- It doesn't have a microphone input.

Bonus:
Seller 'Appario Retails' was generous enough to provide me a carrying case and an extra battery free of cost. Thanks a lot!"

12329,4.0,"i am a vlogger making lot of youtube videos. only small difficulty is there is no external mic option. even the inbuilt mic have super sound quality. and low light performance little down, if you increase room light it can resolve. but i am sure after i got this camera i taken around 60 youtube videos with super clarity with this camera. in this price this kind of camera is very good . i am not going to buy an expensive camera this is ok for me another couple of years as welll as the battery life and zooming quality is very very good. if you need to do vlogging this is the best camera"

One issue is there is no defualt internal storage available. But option available to insert microSD card (128 GB) for storing the recordings. So you need to spend Another 1200 Rs for buying SD card. I am using 64 GB and it will store upto 35 to 40 days data. It will record and store only motion detected activities.

Another option is cloud storage. But the TP Link charging 300 per month. I feel it is too costly. At least they can provide person detection. In Person detection the camera will move right/Left and up/down."

12556,4.0,"It stopped (C100 model) working after approximately 2months. It refuses to power on. The charger is ok since it powers on other devices. So it must be a prob with the camera. I called their toll free #. They asked me to troubleshoot by turning it on, pressing the reset button with a pin, asked me to check the extension cord/power outlet. It refuses to turn on. They also asked for the hardware version and serial # printed on the bottom of the camera. Since nothing worked, they then sent me an email with the address of their service center. So will go there and see what happens. Some yrs earlier, I'd purchased a different TPLink product - a usb wifi. That stopped working after some 6-8months. So i did have my doubts. I currently use a DLink usb wifi, which works well several yrs down.
Update:
I went to their service center which is 10km away (Nagarathpete, near SP Road). They took the camera back and said they'd call me to pick up a replacement in 10-15days. So I will have to go back. But without a cctv, I get tense, cause in my area, plenty of mishief happens. So next time, think I'll go for a different brand.
Update 2:
I got my cctv back from the service center. It's working ok now. I think what might hav caused it to malfunction is - I wrapped black cardboard around it and made a small hole in the center for the lens. This is so it can function as an external camera from inside my home. Without the cardboard, the infrared bounces off the window pane and all I see is the reflection of the camera at night. So one way to get it to work at night is to use it in ""daylight"" mode so the infrared light doesnt turm on, and it relies on the street light outside my home to see at night. Other option was blocking off the infrared light inside the cam with cardboard - this may hav caused the camera to heat up and malfunction. So I'd advise not to use this cardboard method. Think this is a good cctv, wud recommend it."

12630,5.0,Good Product night vision vary clear and motion detection and picture quality is super .
12631,5.0,"I have tried this with 2 different setup ( 2 different routers, one with internet and another one without internet)
Conclusion -

App is excellent, lot of features, alarm sounds is very loud, it perfect security device for someone. Body of camera etc is very good and looks reliable for long term outdoor use, However not tested it under direct sunlight and long term, but they claim its outdoor so it must be work fine under direct sunlight and rough hot weather, and comes with warranty I don't think I need to worry about that.

However, just wanted users to know this.
If you are using router which has internet connection(for ex- broadband) it works like a charm. App is lite and smooth. Very impressed with app features and user friendly design. Great for first time buyers like me. I was able to setup entire camera within less than 3 mins literally. I thought it would be hassle to setup for first time users but it went through all setup steps within 3mins, and boom! It i was live. However it connect with Wired connection and was unable to detect my wireless connection (requires 2.4g wifi) but for some unknown reason it was not connecting which I'm still working on, I checked all parameters into my wifi router but could not figure out the problem. Still working on it.

then I tried 2nd setup, connecting it to router which does not have internet connection but wifi is working and my phone is connected to same router which camera is connected using RJ45 wired connection, but it could not detect the camera at all! I did little research all i could find people saying it will not work on wifi router without internet connection, I'm sitting at home, my phone is connected to wifi router and camera to same router without internet but it will not detect the camera in the app.

So overall make sure you have internet connection in your wifi router to see real time image, otherwise it may not work! you cannot use wifi connection to check or add your device even if you are sitting in range within your home."

12637,4.0,Working Excelently compare to any other cameras i bought last few years. Very good Product and worth investing.
12638,5.0,"The quality is awesome. Easy to install and clarity is superb. I have used 64 GB memory card and it stores last 5-6 days of recording at 2160 resolution then loops itself.
I will advice to shift your wifi router more closer to camera for seemingless performance. I have shared this camera to my father's and mother's phone as well. Working great till now."
12639,4.0,"This was my first purchase of security cameras of any kind. I bought 3 of these for my house in India to cover outdoor areas. Setup was quick and easy. The image quality and sound capture from the cameras is good.
Bear in mind that they are quite small, so the speaker for 2 way comms and siren warnings is not that loud and can't be heard from more than a couple of metres away.
I have a couple of problems with this camera that prevents me giving it a higher rating:
1. As I have 3 dogs, motion detection is off, and AI (person) detection is on. Often, the camera only seems to pick up people when they are walking away and not when they are approaching- a bit pointless as by then you can't see their face anymore.
2. I've gotten quite a few false positive alerts when there are no people in the area being monitored.
To be fair, it is the rainy season here and there are a lot of trees and bushes moving around in the wind along with the dogs, but I would still have expected better.
3. Sometimes when going to live view in the app for a camera, the picture just hangs indefinitely with the timer circle and nothing but a reboot will do- not ideal, but at least there is a remote reboot option."
12640,4.0,"I have been using this cameras for about a month now and here are my take away-
1. Camera quality is good. Both daylight and night time recording are clear.
2. Storage can be expandable upto 128gb which is quite respectable.
3. Working on Wifi network is good.
4. IP66 certification.
5. Tapo care is a subscription which is unnecessary and can be avoided.
6. Software update is a little inconsistent. I bought 2 cameras one got updated last week and another one still not which is weird.
7. AI detection works like a charm.
8. Camera has fixed position and no motor system for panning.
If you are looking for a great outdoor camera then go for it if you budget is between rs. 3500 to 4000. Overall great package."

12642,4.0,"If you are a person looking for 2 way audio don’t go with it. I have ordered it on Amazon based on reviews. Everything looks fine, but the 2 way audio is not working as expected. We can’t expect the intruder to come near camera to concentrate and hear what we say. I didn’t find a customer service over the app. Any suggestions on how to get it fixed ? I have already have CC camera setup at home, preferred it only for 2 way audio and I can’t use it. Very disappointed."

So please don't ever trust what is given in the product description"
12644,3.0,Good. But not adjustments from mobile phone.
12645,5.0,Good picture quality but face and no. Of vehicle not recognize after 20 feet. We can use it without internet but another mobile hot-spot require. Imou 2e picture quality Better than it. 50 minutes clip save in memory card that is good.

12647,5.0,Super camera!!
12648,4.0,mic doesn't work
12649,4.0,I bought 4mp camera variant. Image quality is average and suitable only for distance of 10 feet. Motion detection is awesome and we need 16gb storage to store for one complete day without audio. All image & video are stored in camera and We can't access camera video without internet as expected. We need to buy cloud storage for complete access of offline video which would cost 300rs per month. Overall features are good but I expected much more image clarity and that was disappointing. We can't clearly identify face but with approx guess can identify the person. That's a bad thing for security camera.
12650,5.0,"Lots of issues with connectivity, gets stuck frequently, display color changes to violet or pink and remains till power reset."
12651,3.0,Supper
12652,4.0,Got tp link C100 and C110. Both quality are worth the money but this camera is a little over budget as compared to the picture quality.
12653,5.0,"One needs atleast 3MP camera for outdoor as it needs to capture greater details. I have tried other cameras and while resolution was one issue, colour reproduction was another. This camera reproduces colours as you see with your naked eyes!
Camera build quality is good for outdoors. The Tapo app is good too with good many options like motion alert, area intrusion alert, line crossing alerts and so on. You can choose between continuous recording to alert recordings. The app has profile like feature which applies different settings mentioned above when you are at home and while away from home. Like you can set to record on alert while at home and choose to record continuously when away.

As received with any product this has its flaws too. The alerts detection is flawed so leaves movement, insects 🐞🦗🪰or spider web 🕸️🕷️ that overtime built around this camera gets picked up alerts! Many cameras advertise about human detection as feature however TP-Link provides this as premium feature ie you need to subscribe to their cloud storage feature (costs ₹300/ month or ₹3k /annum). This feature is available for free for limited time.

The device connects on 2.4GHz wifi and has LAN option too. If one has reliable wifi router and connection, this is good enough. Connection setup is simple and intuitive. As said app has good GUI and show to support 32 camera devices on this app. One can LIVE view upto 4 cameras in one go.

I shall add more as I experience this camera little more.

Overall it's a good buy"

12670,4.0,"I checked a lot of reviews but I still bought it looking at the brand name but it's not worth the money. I had a generic non branded (China CC camera) for 5 years which is far better than this. On Tapo, we can't even see the vehicle number from a distance nor identify a person by face. The purpose is not served. The recording features are not good. On my previous camera it used to make parts of recording when on continuous mode but on this I can't see such options not my recording. Can't transfer the motion recorded bits. There are a lot of flaws in the product. Better to look for a different brand."
12671,4.0,30 mts distance is not clearly focused. 15 Mts is perfect
12672,5.0,"i purchased 2 nos of this product for home surveillance in partial outdoor condition and using this for almost a year. product looks stable. But the video is not very great. This product says it records at 2k. When you see the video on mobile screen, it looks good. But when it is zoomed in to identify the face, pixels are breaking too much, and video is not clear. If it's for basic surveillance it is a good product for DIY installation with simple setup. If you're looking for serious Secuity reasons, better go for professional grade cameras with good resolution

Feature wise, this is great product. But if identifying the unknown face at least on half of the captured area and identifying the fast-moving persons then it's not suitable for you"
12673,3.0,"Pros:- Easy to Configure

Cons:
1. Night vision picture quality is poor(below average)

12679,4.0,"It is awesome product. Voice clarity, 1 to 1 talk, picture quality, motion detection all is too good.
If they could add option of recognizable faces may be 4-5 it would be great as any movement by anyone it starts making sound and I can't mute it also as I need to keep the sound on also for the purpose bought.
Easy to install. Go for it."
12680,5.0,Everything is good but alarm time can’t be scheduled on particular area or line activity only
12681,5.0,Good Product night vision vary clear and motion detection and picture quality is super .
12682,5.0,"I have tried this with 2 different setup ( 2 different routers, one with internet and another one without internet)
Conclusion -

App is excellent, lot of features, alarm sounds is very loud, it perfect security device for someone. Body of camera etc is very good and looks reliable for long term outdoor use, However not tested it under direct sunlight and long term, but they claim its outdoor so it must be work fine under direct sunlight and rough hot weather, and comes with warranty I don't think I need to worry about that.

However, just wanted users to know this.
If you are using router which has internet connection(for ex- broadband) it works like a charm. App is lite and smooth. Very impressed with app features and user friendly design. Great for first time buyers like me. I was able to setup entire camera within less than 3 mins literally. I thought it would be hassle to setup for first time users but it went through all setup steps within 3mins, and boom! It i was live. However it connect with Wired connection and was unable to detect my wireless connection (requires 2.4g wifi) but for some unknown reason it was not connecting which I'm still working on, I checked all parameters into my wifi router but could not figure out the problem. Still working on it.

then I tried 2nd setup, connecting it to router which does not have internet connection but wifi is working and my phone is connected to same router which camera is connected using RJ45 wired connection, but it could not detect the camera at all! I did little research all i could find people saying it will not work on wifi router without internet connection, I'm sitting at home, my phone is connected to wifi router and camera to same router without internet but it will not detect the camera in the app.

So overall make sure you have internet connection in your wifi router to see real time image, otherwise it may not work! you cannot use wifi connection to check or add your device even if you are sitting in range within your home."
12683,4.0,Very good product. Go for it
12684,5.0,Easy to install and it presumably would give me good service after watching it for 3 days after installing.

12687,4.0,"Its a nice camera. Points which can be improved are:
1. 2 Way audio sound is very weak
2. Brightness of video is less as compared to a simple PTZ indoor camera.

Rest everything is really awesome."
12688,5.0,Working Excelently compare to any other cameras i bought last few years. Very good Product and worth investing.
12689,4.0,"The quality is awesome. Easy to install and clarity is superb. I have used 64 GB memory card and it stores last 5-6 days of recording at 2160 resolution then loops itself.
I will advice to shift your wifi router more closer to camera for seemingless performance. I have shared this camera to my father's and mother's phone as well. Working great till now."
12690,4.0,"This was my first purchase of security cameras of any kind. I bought 3 of these for my house in India to cover outdoor areas. Setup was quick and easy. The image quality and sound capture from the cameras is good.
Bear in mind that they are quite small, so the speaker for 2 way comms and siren warnings is not that loud and can't be heard from more than a couple of metres away.
I have a couple of problems with this camera that prevents me giving it a higher rating:
1. As I have 3 dogs, motion detection is off, and AI (person) detection is on. Often, the camera only seems to pick up people when they are walking away and not when they are approaching- a bit pointless as by then you can't see their face anymore.

1. So first of all, it doesn't come with memory card. So it's an additional cost. Whereas the other brand provides memory card along with the camera.
2. How much ever you charge it, it will always show low battery.!!!

12777,3.0,"Will not recommend this product for any one.
Pros :
Good toy for kids

Cons
1.Small display that can harm kids eyes
2. Poor poor battery backup- hardly it will last for 15 to 20min. I ordered 2 both are having same backup
3.very low sound
4.price is high.
5.cheap quality material that can damage easily"
12778,4.0,Good product easy to use.. my kid likes it only thing it is bit pricey..

12781,4.0,"This camera my kid just loved it
absolutely he keeps clicking many pictures.
Very easy to use also,
Loved it and happy 🙂"
12782,5.0,Not a good buy
12783,3.0,Like
12784,4.0,Camera needs getting charged several time. One time charge makes it usable hardly for 10 minutes.
12785,4.0,Poor quality . SD card not included - least details about which SD card is needed should have been mentioned
12786,5.0,Dont buy. Even it can't store a single video without memory card.mike is worst and not working
12787,3.0,its good
12788,4.0,"Avoid this camera. Pathetic quality. Initial they will deliver defective product and we will not have an option to return, it a compulsory replacement. After more than 1 week they will again delivery another camera which is again not functioning properly. This time we will not have an option to request for replacement also!

Avoid this, else be ready for 100% regret!

This is my worst purchase from Amazon"
12789,4.0,Don't buy this product its terrible. Worked only for exactly two days!!!!

12792,3.0,This is one of the worst product I have bought in recent years from Amazon.I bought it for my kids birthday.Product quality is so bad that I am really disappointed.Battaries discharged in 10-15 mins. SD card not working in it.Picture quality is so bad that you won't be able to see anything clear.Dont wast your money on this
12793,5.0,Good for kids.. but internal memory is very less.. for video recording you have to buy memory card.. also cannot connect to laptop for transfer the pics...
12794,5.0,We bought it for our kids going on an outstation trip. They not only could use it without much supervision but also enjoyed using it a lot. The quality of the product is very good and it's definitely value for money. Much better than cheap Chinese imports
12795,3.0,Delivery was fine and safely delivered but there was a slight scratch on the display 😊it's ok!
12796,3.0,"After have been using it for almost 10 days. This is my genuine feedback as I don't want others to waste their money like I did. Cause there's no option of refund !
1. So first of all, it doesn't come with memory card. So it's an additional cost. Whereas the other brand provides memory card along with the camera.
2. How much ever you charge it, it will always show low battery.!!!
3. The packaging and overall product quality is not upto the mark compared to other brand/product."
12797,4.0," Need to change this camera 📷 not good very poor,

12811,5.0,It is not good for picture it is use for a toy only
12812,3.0,Picture quality was not that good but then too its better than other kids camera i tested. Best advantage is its 3.5inch screen and selfi camera.
12813,4.0,"The first unit I received would not charge, neither could it hold the charge that it shipped with. The replacement that I received would hang and could only be reset once the battery ran out. In all, the second unit could hardly be used for a total usage time of 10-15 minutes, that too with nothing but glitches. Ended up returning that too. Do yourself a favour and avoid purchasing something to disappoint your children!"

13013,5.0," It’s super cute. Worth every penny. It doesn’t come with reels, gotta order it separately. Definitely recommended."
13014,5.0,"Cost of consumables must be kept in mind before purchasing such products.

In Todays World its more like TOY since consumables too costly and no options to transfer ( SAVE ) photos thro' other options like memory card/usb.

If instant physical copy of photos is in mind, one may buy the same. Otherwise think of other better options for Photography, where one is not satisfied with few photos and cost of consumables too high ( w r t INDIA )"
13015,5.0,"Purchased on 5.09.18 for Rs 3999/- in lightning deal [ Colour Cobalt Blue] .Delivered 11.09.18. Camera used for the first time on 17.09.18 on Vishwakarma Puja. Films and camera case purchased separately from market and are cheaper than online rate . Camera is made in Thailand .Camera has functioned well so far , however, the battery cover has become loose within 3days.

I am a novice in normal photogaphy ( i.e., I use only point & shoot cameras as in mobile phones). Some reviewers have described Fuji Instax Mini as a toy but I do not agree with them. If you like experimenting with photography ,you should try this. If you like something just for fun then too try this.

Instant camera means you have just one chance. The photo may be good or bad depending how you handle it.But this process is immensely satisfying as you strive to improve. The camera comes with good instruction sheet. Read it carefully. Also watch online instruction videos - just Google Fuji Instax Mini 9 & you will come across several. They will show you in detail how to load battery, films and start taking photos. I watched these films before I took the first photo & it came out quite nicely. The camera suggests lightning and I strongly recommend that you follow it, until you become an expert in instant photography. The charm is to see you photos develop instantly and the pleasure of taking autograph on spot (if you take a photo of someone you admire) or presenting a photo to someone.

Load film cartridge exactly as given in instructions .Open foil preferably in dimly lighted room, slip cartridge inside(see videos ), then press the shutter. A film cover will pop out. the camera will show that 10 films are loaded. Now it is ready to use. As you take photos, the camera will indicate how many films left.

A photo takes about 3 minutes to develop fully. DO NOT SHAKE THE PHOTO. Just put it gently on a flat surface, away from strong light. After 3 mins, show it to everyone. Store photos in albums.

Use the close-up lens to get good photos. Distance should be between 35 -50cm, not more. Without lens it should be 60cm to 2.5m. Instant photography is not for people in a hurry. Films are expensive, so you have to be patient when you take photos. Some times better results come for the photographer to sit down & take instant photo. I took the first photo sitting on a bench. I have not yet taken a selfie so I cant comment on that aspect. The photos are small in size like an ATM card.So you should plan what photos to take. If for eg you take full figure the person photographed will look tiny. In my childhood days of black & white photography with non-digital film cameras or box camera as they were called, small square photos used to be developed. The photos in the instax mini are about that type (though not square). If you have old black & white photos at home, it will give you an idea about size of the subject in photos.

I initially wanted to own this camera because of its colours. I followed Amazon pricing for more than one year, before I plunged in the lightning deal. I took the decision to buy it recently,after someone took my instant photo( in a more expensive camera) & presented it to me. Fuji instax mini is the cheapest among instant cameras. Try it and you will get addicted."
13016,3.0,Ok
13017,3.0,Easy to use and gives retro look to pics
13018,5.0,I didn't buy it for myself bought it for a friend's bday. My friend love it. The picture quality was more than I expected from its looks. The size was comfortable and looked cute.
13019,5.0,"So I ordered this Fujifilm instant camera and in the bullet points of this camera, it is clearly mentioned that it has ''Approximately 10 instax mini film packs with new AA batteries) ; Film Feeding out: Automatic'', but to my knowledge it has no film packs."

13025,4.0,JUST A WASTE OF MONEY. SUCH EXPENSIVE FILM AND PICTURE QUALITY IS JUST VERY POOR. IT GIVES BLACK BACKGROUND TO INDOOR PICTURES. USELESS PRODUCT . WASTAGE OF MONEY
13026,1.0,Quality is pretty good and easy to use must have it too catch memories
13027,5.0, To the best purchases done so far ….. its amazing easy to use and images comes out so pretty clear . I had ordered lime green colour and it was so damn beautifull 😍😍 … would recommend to everyone out there do go for it if you are thinking to buy one. Highly recommended ♥️♥️
13028,3.0,Go for it
13029,5.0,Not working this camera when I clicked only blank pictures outside
13030,5.0,"I ordered Fujifilm Instantx mini 9 Instant Camera (Ice Blue) from amazon on 5th June and got it by 10th(a day before amazon promised).
Packaging of the product was not so secure, as i thought it is an electronic appliance it should have been bubble rapped and then put it in a box. (But i received my product in great condition.)
In box i received, the items as mentioned by the seller. I also ordered the Fujifilm Instax mini shot films-value pack of 6 with the Camera.
After inserting the film and placing the AA batteries(which i received with camera) , i was ready to cliq my first shot, (though first cliq was a blank shot) (the second cliq was the image) the image quality considering the room light was good(not excellent), but for few moments that camera took me to our good golden days where you have to choose wisely whether the scene is beautiful enough to pictured as we cant follow trial and error method with this camera. that creeeking sound and their was my first shot. The image takes almost 40-50 secs before appearing.
Though the size of the film is little small but it perfectly gives you the feel of instant camera. The mirror to take selfies is a nicely placed and a great help to place our face in correct direction.
Overall, i would say, Fujifilm instax mini 9 is great purchase, it offers you the retro vibe in a much less cost."
13031,4.0,Is not working
13032,5.0,Product quality is good. But the picture are really bad. It has a no bath factor but pictures are extremely dark.
13033,1.0,"Yep. The camera captures good photos in bright light. However indoor lighting isn't sufficient to bring out the shadows and a lot of the image is just black.

After taking ~15 pics the picture would start to get stuck while it was printing out and then the camera stopped working.
All the lights keep lighting up - tried changing battery didn't help.

Have to take it to the service center to get it fixed.
Hopefully it works fine after that.

But I was overall happy with the product when it was working."
13034,1.0,"I bought it for my wife's bday. She and I are not the people who are camera frenzy and we hardly end up taking any pics on phone.
I thought this would change the meoria.
It did! Awesome quality for selfies or short landscape mode pics. I really love the filters which helped in taking different types of pics .
Although outdated, this is one of the most interesting puchases ever made.
Worth the money!!"
13035,4.0,"This review comes from someone who has already used Instax Mini 8. The newer variant - Mini 9 is no different, or may be slightly better - but overall still a disappointment.

Don't go by the pictures used for marketing this camera. The picture quality in reality is not even close to what they show on the packaging / marketing / promos.

Be prepared to get disappointed with below average photos which are not even close to what you would expect from an Instant camera.

This camera only satiates your thirst for 'instant gratification'. Once the initial few photos come out, you will be left with a permanent sense of disappointment.

I am thankful to Amazon to offer me a replacement because I received a faulty camera the first time."
13036,5.0,I found it really fun to have kind of camera.. best part is that you get the photos instantly and can save and share ot as a memory with them loved ones. Downside is that it photos are best captured in daylight in outdoors.. indoor pics are not that good. But overall its worth it. Note that the film is costly. But again if you wish to have the luxury of instant pics its worth investing in this camera
13037,1.0,"Firstly, the picture didn't appeared and when the pictures appeared the quality of picture is really poor."
13038,5.0,"Go for it but keep that in mind it can feel costly for you and they don't even provide a film roll too, you need to buy one. Which cost approx 500rs per roll which has 10 pictures... It's upto you small cost to pay for an iconic feel..."
13039,2.0,Picture quality isn’t great but it’s not bad either. It’s a good product for the price. So happy with the purchase.
13040,1.0,"Got faulty prices twice. Packet was tampered during first delivery and the second peice too never worked. Since it was a gift to someone, by the time i got to know about the fault the return window had closed."
13041,5.0,Good one
13042,1.0,In sun its over exposure and in low light its very dark photos
13043,1.0,"Mother board will be broken in case if u have a low charge battery inside
No warnings no errors but directly motherboard will be broken
Issue is resolved in Instax 11 is what I came to know from service centre
So don’t buy instax 9 if the issue come after warranty period service cost is same as camera price
In case if you already have instax 9 please use new battery after 20 shots or long storage period"
13044,5.0,"The photos were completely useless below 10°C (couldn't develop properly). Also at slightly low brightness, it dissapoints. Only photos which arr taken in very bright condition and a temperature > 12°C develops properly."
13045,5.0,"The camera, look-wise, is real cute and nice, especially in the mint blue colour that I ordered. It’s easy to operate and gives you instant pictures for memorabilia. But the picture quality is what they need to improve on. Even in broad sunlight with proper settings, the picture appears to be a bit darker, and a little bit blur. You really need to take care of the surrounding lighting in which you click the picture using it. The films are costly, so you would not want any of your shot to be bad."
13046,5.0,"Instant camera will make anyone happy as it would print photo within few seconds of a click!! But sad part is that buying a film is very expensive as it has only 10 in each film , that way cannot experiment on clicks, its very disappointing if the photo doesn't come as expected due to the fact film is costly!! Also camera settings you will have to get used to it as there is always a flash, you would waste every film until you get the hang of it!! To also mind the size of photo, its exactly a credit card size that's all!!"
13047,5.0,a lil too small but overall good! 📷
13048,5.0,"It is a kids camera. Picture quality is just OK if you click with 2-3 ft distance. But it is super easy to use, even putting sheets for photo is super easy. Good feel for kids. Do expect a good quality photo and don't expect to click a group photo because for that you have click from distance and the photo will be ruined."
13049,1.0,Film is very costly
13050,1.0,"Well, Ideal gift for boys and perfect fit for a small party.
I feel the frame size of the film is smaller than expected.
Feel worth the money"
13051,1.0,"This camera is handy,portable and children friendly, easy to carry around! The one sale point of this camera= instant camera.
One point why not to buy it:
The film developing print sheet is very costly, obviously children are very excited to use it to make it ,20 sheets will be emptied in under 5 minutes that 1500 to 2000 Indian Rupees n they will get on your nerves for another 20 sheet pack,you got surplus money to waste go ahead n buy it for your kid.
Picture quality ok
You need technique to develop the photos
Buy it, use it once then box it n forgot it!"
13052,1.0,There is no repairing centre in Dimapur if you would suggest a way would be great
13053,1.0,"Good product, did not expect great photo ability so was not disappointed. It's not a digital camera🙂
If it's for kids, make sure to give a heads up of refill cartilage cost."
13054,1.0,"The camera is good but the films are way too expensive. They should have included atleast 10 films with camera. However you have to buy it sepearately.
Think twice before buying as once you bought it you cannot return it. You can only replace the product."
13055,1.0,"I like this camera coz when I was a kid my father used to own one and it sure gives a nostalgia towards the Polaroid Camera.
With that it is indeed a easy to use camera, Just click and bam the Polaroid appears from the slot.
The only thing that I didn't like is that there are no extra film package is included with the purchase. I meam of the company would have given just 1 extra film package it would be an offer non can refuse.
None-the-less I like this camera and I would recommend everyone to try if they like those old photos that you can hold and enjoy rather tham the digital ones."

Downside is that it photos are best captured in daylight in outdoors.. indoor pics are not that good. But overall its worth it. Note that the film is costly. But again if you wish to have the luxury of instant pics its worth investing in this camera
13082,5.0,"Firstly, the picture didn't appeared and when the pictures appeared the quality of picture is really poor."
13083,1.0,"Go for it but keep that in mind it can feel costly for you and they don't even provide a film roll too, you need to buy one. Which cost approx 500rs per roll which has 10 pictures... It's upto you small cost to pay for an iconic feel..."
13084,1.0,Picture quality isn’t great but it’s not bad either. It’s a good product for the price. So happy with the purchase.
13085,4.0,"Got faulty prices twice. Packet was tampered during first delivery and the second peice too never worked. Since it was a gift to someone, by the time i got to know about the fault the return window had closed."
13086,5.0,Good one
13087,1.0,In sun its over exposure and in low light its very dark photos
13088,5.0,"Mother board will be broken in case if u have a low charge battery inside
No warnings no errors but directly motherboard will be broken
Issue is resolved in Instax 11 is what I came to know from service centre
So don’t buy instax 9 if the issue come after warranty period service cost is same as camera price
In case if you already have instax 9 please use new battery after 20 shots or long storage period"
13089,2.0,"The photos were completely useless below 10°C (couldn't develop properly). Also at slightly low brightness, it dissapoints. Only photos which arr taken in very bright condition and a temperature > 12°C develops properly."
13090,1.0,"The camera, look-wise, is real cute and nice, especially in the mint blue colour that I ordered. It’s easy to operate and gives you instant pictures for memorabilia. But the picture quality is what they need to improve on. Even in broad sunlight with proper settings, the picture appears to be a bit darker, and a little bit blur. You really need to take care of the surrounding lighting in which you click the picture using it. The films are costly, so you would not want any of your shot to be bad."
13091,5.0,"Instant camera will make anyone happy as it would print photo within few seconds of a click!! But sad part is that buying a film is very expensive as it has only 10 in each film , that way cannot experiment on clicks, its very disappointing if the photo doesn't come as expected due to the fact film is costly!! Also camera settings you will have to get used to it as there is always a flash, you would waste every film until you get the hang of it!! To also mind the size of photo, its exactly a credit card size that's all!!"
13092,1.0,a lil too small but overall good! 📷
13093,1.0,"It is a kids camera. Picture quality is just OK if you click with 2-3 ft distance. But it is super easy to use, even putting sheets for photo is super easy. Good feel for kids. Do expect a good quality photo and don't expect to click a group photo because for that you have click from distance and the photo will be ruined."
13094,5.0,Film is very costly
13095,5.0,"Well, Ideal gift for boys and perfect fit for a small party.
I feel the frame size of the film is smaller than expected.
Feel worth the money"
13096,5.0,"This camera is handy,portable and children friendly, easy to carry around! The one sale point of this camera= instant camera.
One point why not to buy it:
The film developing print sheet is very costly, obviously children are very excited to use it to make it ,20 sheets will be emptied in under 5 minutes that 1500 to 2000 Indian Rupees n they will get on your nerves for another 20 sheet pack,you got surplus money to waste go ahead n buy it for your kid.
Picture quality ok
You need technique to develop the photos
Buy it, use it once then box it n forgot it!"
13097,5.0,There is no repairing centre in Dimapur if you would suggest a way would be great
13098,5.0,"Good product, did not expect great photo ability so was not disappointed. It's not a digital camera🙂
If it's for kids, make sure to give a heads up of refill cartilage cost."
13099,1.0,"The camera is good but the films are way too expensive. They should have included atleast 10 films with camera. However you have to buy it sepearately.
Think twice before buying as once you bought it you cannot return it. You can only replace the product."
13100,1.0,"I like this camera coz when I was a kid my father used to own one and it sure gives a nostalgia towards the Polaroid Camera.
With that it is indeed a easy to use camera, Just click and bam the Polaroid appears from the slot.
The only thing that I didn't like is that there are no extra film package is included with the purchase. I meam of the company would have given just 1 extra film package it would be an offer non can refuse.
None-the-less I like this camera and I would recommend everyone to try if they like those old photos that you can hold and enjoy rather tham the digital ones."
13101,1.0,Worth to buy
13102,1.0,"Doesn't allow connection with Alexa, even though they mention it does. Everyone complaining about the same thing at Zeb home skill on Alexa"
13103,1.0,Never leave a single mosquitos in night. And taking photos and inforning midnight very perfectly. Im very happy. Goodluck for buyers. Only thing need to sailent our notification permantely for good sleeping
13104,1.0,"Overall good product. Taking option is not good due to sound quality and lag.. but in this price range, it is satisfactory.."
13105,1.0,Good performance
13106,5.0,"I have two of them and I like using this except there is no option to turn off the annoying welcome voice message - powering on, connecting network and camera online"
13107,5.0,"I returned it due to non support of memory card. Local shopkeeper told that camera only support SanDisk, but hp is non supporting memory card. Second, interface isn't good as mi. You will feel proper cheep feel while using it. Yes, sensors are good."
13108,5.0,Picture quality nice mainly daytime. In full dark road it's not work up to mark.its require 24/7 internet for work.
13109,3.0,Nice
13110,4.0,nice product
13111,3.0,Not bad
13112,4.0,"This is basically a IP cam. It needs to be connected to the internet for it to record (even locally). This can be bypassed after a firmware update which will be sent to us when we contact customer care.
Customer Care was very active and helped resolve the issue.
Motion detection needs active internet connection."
13113,4.0,Night vision and picture quality is vrey good
13114,3.0,"Good things :
1. You will install this CCTV camera at this much low price. (4/5)
2. Video quality is good. You don't need too much detail of things in photos clicked with this as it is not a video camera. Also, for that much quality you need much space. (5/5)
3. Infrared.
4. Good design. Size similar to JioFi(5/5)

Bad things :
1. Only can be accessed through its app only. I tried with Window laptop using universal apps but not works.
2. File size can be the issue. This is a huge cons. Because if you want to start recording for long period you will get high file size . Android can save single file size upto 4GB. It means you can only record for period that generated 4GB video file size. Windows can save much higher file size.
3. You need hotspot in your home to use it. It will connect to that hotspot (Wifi network). Your phone with the app also must be connected to that Wifi network. Means you cannot directly using it without Wifi network.
4. Sougn is very poor. We must have some options to disable that sound. For eg. Whenever it starts it says ""camera connecting..."", ""connecting to network..."" and click sound when camera switches between normal to infrared and vice versa. THis is frustating because if there is electrcity down, it get switch off and after electric supply it again making those frustating sound.
5. Startup time : 10 seconds.
6. There must be usb adapter in the box.
7. Android goes into sleep mode. Its connection stopped means you can't stream video into the app.
8. App is not great.
9. Website is not well maintained.

I will not recommend to anyone to buy this if you are buying it for serious use. You can buy it for fun."
13115,4.0,Very nice product
13116,5.0,It's a good product for this budget. Clear view as I have tested and found ok.
13117,5.0,Liked every bit of it right from it's function capturing moments
13118,5.0,"Picture quality is pretty good and serves the purpose. The infra red picture quality is also very good.

The cable is too short and there is no charger bundled. 2 way audio is fine. Mic is good as you can hear from it. Since it is wall mountable, you can use it on the wall as a door camera. It is not weather proof so don't install outside. The swivil stand is good and holds up the camera. One thing to note is that the camera is very light.

Go for it if you need an indoor camera. This is very good and smaller than others. I bought 2 more after I purchased the first one."
13119,5.0,Ok
13120,3.0,"The camera worked fine for 2 days and after that, if there is an electricity failure, the device shows offline all the time on the app, I had to reset it again and after a couple of resets, it was not even connecting.

A couple of feedback points, based on my usage for two days

1. This device requires internet every time you boot this (if not connected to the internet on boot it will not even write on an sd card)
2. you can set up using wifi-hotspot
3. it won't write on the sd card if power failures, you have to connect this to the app then only it will resume
4. motion detection is not up to the mark, the object should be close than only it will detect motion
5. for a small room or shop the camera quality is good.
6. setup is easy but needs to reset and reconnect if it shows offline.
7. some times it won't work on a slow network (e.g. hotspot)
8. speaker quality is poor
9. look wise product is good and has the option to mount on the wall.
10. if the device is connected with internet multiple user can access it and see live feed along with recording (need zeb home app with same credentials)"
13121,2.0,I like the day clarity is very good in HD mainly it's very clear
13122,5.0,"Picture quality is great even the night vision. Local Recording can be done using a micro sd card, there's no need for wifi. however to view you via app you need to have an active wifi. one can use ipc player (link available by contacting zebronics support) to see recording in pc but there's no fast forward option neither in ipc nor in the app which is essential if you want to see a long recording. hope they will bring an update to the App soon. the speaker is not that powerful/clear, mic is ok for 2 way talk."
13123,5.0,"The camera quality is quite good but audio is very poor.
I connected through mobile hotspot, works good

Noise cancellation feature is not available. And also the speaker audio volume can't be adjust. Very low voice from the cam speaker..."
13124,5.0,Nice product
13125,5.0,"For 1430 I don't think there's more reliable camera. I wanted to buy the Xiaomi basic camera that sells for 1799 but it was unavailable for a long time so i bought this one. Wall mount is available. Card slot is there. I'm using 64 GB which stores 6 days of continuous recording. Picture quality is fine. Keeping it in auto night vision mode almost keep the camera always in night mode even when good amount of light is there. I think that's a downside. But if you can live with a video without color, it will be fine. Connectivity is no issue. App is connected to 4 phone in 3 different countries so no access issue. Recommended."
13126,4.0,"Average product.
After one month of using it is showing offline. Unable to connect the app"
13127,4.0,"I received this cam in the same situation as you can see in hand in pics.
The delivery guy is a nasty person. Always throw stuff in house without informing us.
By chance we saw him taping the outer package which totally open. He keeps the Amazon tape with him and tape the boxes after crushing them.

Cam is alright. HD QUALITY IS ALSO GOOD.
but in the night vision infra red light is totally visible. If you wan to hide the camera is not possible. Little heating issue.

It is totally dependent upon wifi signals.
If you have good wifi connections then installing is easy. Otherwise you would feel to throw it.
It has no automatic recording. You have to on it through app.
I bought for village. But found ut totally waste for there due to bad wifi connection there.
For cities it's good."

13129,4.0,Supab camera
13130,3.0,"The camara works with a continuous power supply with electricity or power bank or battery, need a memory card in order to keep the device up and running but worth of cost"
13131,4.0,I hàve brought three of this product for home security. Camera quality is blurd. Voice calling creates reverbs. At last if you purchase cloud service for storage they will deduct money and will not activate the service with no refunds. Customer support doesn't answer to mail. They intentionally provide unavailable customer care number. No use of warranty .I did a mistake of purchasing even after reading reviews.
13132,5.0, Product me light nhi chlu h and wifi is not connected
13133,5.0,"Got this product within a day after booking. Value for money. It is easy to install. Could see the live videos from two phones with the same login neatly. The movement detection is good. What amazed me was the Night vision mode. Even when lights were off, we could see the entire area and it recognized the movements neatly. I had bought a MI WIFI camera last year. The night vision never worked in that. So, we are extremely happy that we made the right decision. Yet to test Recording as the memory card is yet to be delivered. Will update you post that."

13136,2.0,Everything is fine except i don't understand why they would sell products with only a cable and no wall plug? That's basically a hidden cost. Will write a more detailed review after a few days of use. For now the functioning of the camera itself is satisfactory. App could be improved.
13137,5.0,Product is awesome but it should be sold with compatible SD card for memory purpose so that the customer will not suffer in buying this separately!

13200,5.0,"Got this recently. Started using it. Found a strange issue with the recorded videos. When I transferred the footage from the MicroSD card directly into the computer, all the videos were jittery and laggy including the ones with 4K 30fps, 1080p 30fps ones too. After a lot of experimentation, found out that the videos have to be downloaded into the mobile through the XDV Pro app. Then if I transfer the file into the computer, it plays normally and the video works well. Strangely both the file sizes match byte to byte but only the one transferred through the XDV Pro app plays well.

Not sure what the issue is.

Update: The videos need to be transferred from the camera directly through the micro USB cable. I figured this out and let the customer support know. They were helpful too."

Great gadget for beginners.
Experts stay away.
Budget friendly package of action camera within this range a great one.

A good camera for videos won't recommend it for photography. Pictures from this will make you sad.
Pictures and videos in bright day light are awesome.

Talking about the body of the camera few things must be upgraded...
1. Battery slot lock must be improved.
2. There is no slot lock for charging point and the place where SD card is inserted.

Sharing a Time-lapse of 50 seconds, captured in 1080p quality and day light.

May keep updating this review after using the Cason CN10 more.

I bought this camera for my trip to Sikkim.
Wish I had not taken important videos in it.
We kept taking videos for 10 days without knowing what we were going to face once back. Editing the footage of this camera was a pain in the wrong place. And playing videos in VLC player did not happen properly. There is some major issue with the codecs of the video recorded. Even Professional editing softwares like Premiere pro and Vegas could not play/ render the videos properly. Editing that was supposed to be done in 2 days took me 2 months.

On day two I came across a youtuber with this specific camera and was amazed! This camera has everything you need to get some amazing video shots and even comes with a bundle of accessories that would total over 2k probably if you were to try to get the go pro. The best part is that this camera shoots great high quality footage in 1080p and 4K and is so easy to carry around.

13297,5.0,"Simply superb camera. Wonderful how they pack such an advance technology in a small pack. This is the magic of mirrorless technology from SONY.Dynamite in small size. It incorporate such advance camera technologies that beats bigger dsIrs easily. Especially the eye auto focus is blazingly fast. At this price it beats even double priced DSLR of other brands.
Pictures are razor sharp with nice pleasing color. Very easy to carry as small lightweight. Excellent buy in sale. IF you are planning to buy a enthusiastic camera which gives professional quality results this camera should be high on your priority. This review comes from a freelance photojournalist who owns many DSLR and mirrorless from many brands. Honest review"
13298,1.0,"1) Pictures are nice, auto mode works pretty well.
Use the manual mode for better pictures during too-bright or too-dark conditions.
2) Bokeh - background blur works well
3) Menu is annoying - have to dig thru them to figure out what is needed
4) Resolution is a bit low for my liking - while zooming out one cannot see the clarity on a monitor
5) Low light is not that great - higher iso adds noise
6) Battery life is pretty decent

Packaging:
Brought the camera + 16-55 MM lens for ~66K.
Received a 64GB card but no camera bag, however sony website says they usually ship. The seal was opened before I opened the product."
13299,5.0,Buy the body and get 30mm or 35mm or 56mm sigma lenses or 18-50mm lens
13300,4.0, This camera right here is the best beginner camera. And if u play with the features it turns out to be a professional one as well. Auto focus the best. And the real time image focus just took my breath away! Geez ... I just love capturing pictures from this camera. One has to have this product. As always Sony you're the best.
13301,1.0,Nice
13302,5.0,"If looking for vlog, check ZV10 once.
Few trade offs are there with this 6100 but overall very good package.

13303,2.0, Have not started using it yet. Got delivered today. Will come back after a month. Trip is coming up
13304,1.0,"ORDERED: Sony Alpha ILCE 6100L

First and foremost a BIG THANKS to Amazon for delivering the product on time as promised. Given the global supply chain crisis, chip shortages...we were not getting SONY A6100 + Lens (16-50 mm) from anywhere (onine stores, offline stores, local shops). Yet Amazon delievered this camera within 4 days of ordering.

In the BOX: Sony A6100, Lens (16-50 mm), Lens cap, Carry Bag, Memory card 64GB, Power Cord, Rechargable Battery, AC Adaptor, Shoulder Strap, Eyepiece cup, Micro USB Cable.

Now coming to the Sony camera, it is simply an amazing camera for begginners. If you are looking into mirrorrless cameras and under a budget, then this is the one!
-The Autofocus system is far better than competitors.
-Color science is bang on.
-Wifi enabled image sharing.
-Flip up screen is much much useful than flip down or flip sideways.
-Not an issue but just to note, the touch screen becomes touchless when inside ""Menu"". But navigation though buttons is much more practical and hassle free, so touch is not really needed while navigating through menu options.
-Advance processor under the hood.
-Light weight and very handy.
-One mount lenses by sony, so it is future proof.

Go for it, legit product!"
13305,5.0,Op camera with Sony 50mm lens...just because it's crop sensor u won't get full frame look but with speedbooster might be possible...but there is no speed booster which support e mount lens....and 6100 has finest af speed better than canon rp full frame...and also I want to make a request to sony that pls make a speedbooster which is capable of emount lens...
13306,4.0,"This camera is good for beginners with the correct tutorial. I am currently using the kit lens for taking pictures. Low light performance is awesome in this camera. The colour science of sony camera is also a highlight.
Looking to upgrade the lens to enhance the performace."

13308,3.0,"It’s one of the best cameras for photography, though one will need some time to adjust to the proper settings..once set, you are good to go.."
13309,3.0,"No question about build quality, picture quality, they are simply superb. Amazon packaging could be better and the camera bag given could be bit larger, it is very small. Overall experience on purchasing the sony a6100 from Amazon is simply awesome."
13310,4.0,Very good camera for entering mirrorless slab. Picture quality is too good. Low light performance is fabulous.
13311,3.0,"First of all "" it's discount on Amazon is awesome. Like we saved 7.5k off msrp with one lens and body. That's awesome. As I used dslr, but when I started to use this , the compact camera , lightweight and the clarity. Omg . It's so good. And portability is like another level. As a beginner in photograph .. I strongly recommend anyone to get this instead of a dslr. For more info Google about ILCE VS DSLR and find it out yourself. Buy this over alpha 6000. Because a6000 is old and lacks lots and lots of feature. I mean it is also a really good camera no doubt. It's the most sold sony APS-C on the planet, But this A6100 also competes with even intermediate and advanced cameras. To put a small list of features
: tiltable LCD 3"" Screen
EVF SUPER clarity.
Easy to use Wi-Fi to connect , when compared with other companies
Focus 0.06 sec (unbelievable)
11fps shoots
Plus sony also has it's class of lens. Check their catalogue , well they are a bit costly. But this body is made like a TANK , future proof, you can change any amount of E MOUNT lens in the future.
Customisable menu as well as buttons.( do you even find this in other camera )

You will be so much satisfied when you buy this. There is also an a6400 or a6600 but. This is really good enough for beginner and even intermediate photographers.

Put that extra 10 or 15 k and buy this please. I know mirrorless are expensive. But this is worth that every extra penny."
13312,4.0,"Next day delivery, it was amazing. And in addition to this I got 64 GB sony Memory card and small Sony camera bag (quality is ok).- even the description doesn't show these extra items but i found these items inside.

Dislikes:

One point to notice - Keep using it each 2 weeks at least for good lifetime."
13314,3.0, Memmory card not working
13315,4.0,"Totally worth every single penny you pay.

Pros: Best Video & low-light performance in this segment. Autofocus focus works like magic.
Excellent quality 4k, 1080p and slow motion videos. A good option for travel vloggers on a budget.
Excellent high iso performance compared to competitors.

Cons: Lack of in body image stabilization, micro usb port, built quality not that premium. Touch controls only available for focus. File transfer via wifi is very slow, not practical for extremely big images and videos it produces."

13319,4.0,"Considering the price point and with two lenses, the A6100 is still very good value as it brings some of Sony's flagship-level technology to a more approachable price point.
Everything is perfect about this camera but it's disappointing to not have a USB Type-C port even at this price point."

13345,5.0,"Product quality is good and video quality is also well but there is no any image stabilization and video results are very shakey
Minor vibration also we can notice in end result"
13346,3.0,Please buy the product from sony India directly. What you get here is not the precise product mentioned by Amazon. I bought one and had to fight to return it.
13347,5.0,"Simply superb camera. Wonderful how they pack such an advance technology in a small pack. This is the magic of mirrorless technology from SONY.Dynamite in small size. It incorporate such advance camera technologies that beats bigger dsIrs easily. Especially the eye auto focus is blazingly fast. At this price it beats even double priced DSLR of other brands.
Pictures are razor sharp with nice pleasing color. Very easy to carry as small lightweight. Excellent buy in sale. IF you are planning to buy a enthusiastic camera which gives professional quality results this camera should be high on your priority. This review comes from a freelance photojournalist who owns many DSLR and mirrorless from many brands. Honest review"
13348,2.0,"1) Pictures are nice, auto mode works pretty well.
Use the manual mode for better pictures during too-bright or too-dark conditions.
2) Bokeh - background blur works well
3) Menu is annoying - have to dig thru them to figure out what is needed
4) Resolution is a bit low for my liking - while zooming out one cannot see the clarity on a monitor
5) Low light is not that great - higher iso adds noise
6) Battery life is pretty decent

Packaging:
Brought the camera + 16-55 MM lens for ~66K.
Received a 64GB card but no camera bag, however sony website says they usually ship. The seal was opened before I opened the product."
13349,3.0,Buy the body and get 30mm or 35mm or 56mm sigma lenses or 18-50mm lens
13350,4.0, This camera right here is the best beginner camera. And if u play with the features it turns out to be a professional one as well. Auto focus the best. And the real time image focus just took my breath away! Geez ... I just love capturing pictures from this camera. One has to have this product. As always Sony you're the best.
13351,5.0,Nice
13352,4.0,"If looking for vlog, check ZV10 once.
Few trade offs are there with this 6100 but overall very good package.
One of the best available in market As of 2022."
13353,4.0, Have not started using it yet. Got delivered today. Will come back after a month. Trip is coming up
13354,1.0,"ORDERED: Sony Alpha ILCE 6100L

First and foremost a BIG THANKS to Amazon for delivering the product on time as promised. Given the global supply chain crisis, chip shortages...we were not getting SONY A6100 + Lens (16-50 mm) from anywhere (onine stores, offline stores, local shops). Yet Amazon delievered this camera within 4 days of ordering.

In the BOX: Sony A6100, Lens (16-50 mm), Lens cap, Carry Bag, Memory card 64GB, Power Cord, Rechargable Battery, AC Adaptor, Shoulder Strap, Eyepiece cup, Micro USB Cable.

Now coming to the Sony camera, it is simply an amazing camera for begginners. If you are looking into mirrorrless cameras and under a budget, then this is the one!
-The Autofocus system is far better than competitors.
-Color science is bang on.
-Wifi enabled image sharing.
-Flip up screen is much much useful than flip down or flip sideways.
-Not an issue but just to note, the touch screen becomes touchless when inside ""Menu"". But navigation though buttons is much more practical and hassle free, so touch is not really needed while navigating through menu options.
-Advance processor under the hood.
-Light weight and very handy.
-One mount lenses by sony, so it is future proof.

Go for it, legit product!"
13355,4.0,Op camera with Sony 50mm lens...just because it's crop sensor u won't get full frame look but with speedbooster might be possible...but there is no speed booster which support e mount lens....and 6100 has finest af speed better than canon rp full frame...and also I want to make a request to sony that pls make a speedbooster which is capable of emount lens...
13356,4.0,"This camera is good for beginners with the correct tutorial. I am currently using the kit lens for taking pictures. Low light performance is awesome in this camera. The colour science of sony camera is also a highlight.
Looking to upgrade the lens to enhance the performace."
13357,4.0,Product & the picture quality is good but i am not happy with the delivery time. Instead of prime membership it took 14 days to deliver. Pathetic service by Amazon.
13358,3.0,"It’s one of the best cameras for photography, though one will need some time to adjust to the proper settings..once set, you are good to go.."
13359,3.0,"No question about build quality, picture quality, they are simply superb. Amazon packaging could be better and the camera bag given could be bit larger, it is very small. Overall experience on purchasing the sony a6100 from Amazon is simply awesome."
13360,4.0,Very good camera for entering mirrorless slab. Picture quality is too good. Low light performance is fabulous.
13361,3.0,"First of all "" it's discount on Amazon is awesome. Like we saved 7.5k off msrp with one lens and body. That's awesome. As I used dslr, but when I started to use this , the compact camera , lightweight and the clarity. Omg . It's so good. And portability is like another level. As a beginner in photograph .. I strongly recommend anyone to get this instead of a dslr. For more info Google about ILCE VS DSLR and find it out yourself. Buy this over alpha 6000. Because a6000 is old and lacks lots and lots of feature. I mean it is also a really good camera no doubt. It's the most sold sony APS-C on the planet, But this A6100 also competes with even intermediate and advanced cameras. To put a small list of features
: tiltable LCD 3"" Screen
EVF SUPER clarity.
Easy to use Wi-Fi to connect , when compared with other companies
Focus 0.06 sec (unbelievable)
11fps shoots
Plus sony also has it's class of lens. Check their catalogue , well they are a bit costly. But this body is made like a TANK , future proof, you can change any amount of E MOUNT lens in the future.

13422,5.0,"Good clarity and night vision in standard operation. But, this camera doesn't support access point mode in which a mobile can directly connect to the camera. You need wifi *with internet* access. The mounting screw could have been a bit longer. A small push will dismount the camera and there is a risk of falling. There is no software switch to turn on and off the mic, speaker, indicator LED, or IR LEDs. This will leave you with problems due to unwanted announcements disturbing your sleep, indicator LED always glowing and IR LED causing reflected IR light causing a glare even when you don't need it."

You need wifi *with internet* access. The mounting screw could have been a bit longer. A small push will dismount the camera and there is a risk of falling. There is no software switch to turn on and off the mic, speaker, indicator LED, or IR LEDs. This will leave you with problems due to unwanted announcements disturbing your sleep, indicator LED always glowing and IR LED causing reflected IR light causing a glare even when you don't need it."
13472,5.0,"Liked camera quality, dis like un able to connect proper net"

Note:- no memory card inside the box you need to buy new memory card and camera bag also.."
13503,1.0,"Very nice DSLR for beginners.
Thanks to Amazon for better EMI option."
13504,1.0,very nice photo
13505,1.0,"This is a good model to start with, although it is still bulky from a user experience point of view. I think the cameras that are now coming on the phone are equally powerful as compared to SLR - I bought this to learn photography but to be honest, for everyday pictures, it is a lot more convenient to snap out your phone and take a high-quality picture. How Cannon can keep its relevance with SLR - it is a tough question to answer right now"
13506,4.0,Camera image is very good
13507,4.0," Announced on 10 April, Canon’s EOS 200D Mark II is also known as the Rebel SL3, EOS 250D or Kiss X10, depending on where in the world you live. The smallest and lightest Canon DSLR so far, it is targeted at entry-level users who want a more capable camera than their smartphone. Physically, the Mark II model is almost identical to the original EOS 200D, having the same sized body but being a couple of grams lighter."
13508,4.0,"A DSLR camera is as as good as the lens it comes with. I am not a professional photographer, but someone who likes to take good pictures! The first set of pictures I have taken with this camera was on a visit to a wildlife sanctuary. While taking a shot, it appears that the object is far off, even with zoom, but once the shot is captured, the picture comes absolutely clear and perfect! However for longer shots, Obviously one has to invest in costlier and powerful DSLR lens! Lighting with or without flash is perfect. I just used AF and kept shooting and I was absolutely delighted with the product!"
13509,4.0,Good quality camera also good for beginners...
13510,4.0,Nice product would have loved it if the 55-250 mm lens is included
13511,4.0,"Perfect DSLR camera for beginners and enthusiasts. 24.1 mega pixel Sensor, Digic 8 processor with Dual pixel AF and vari-angle Touch screen definitely a big plus to this camera.

with a combination of point-and-shoot simplicity, a Guided UI (user interface) to walk new users through the basics of photography, and a Creative Assist mode for more adventurous photographic effects.

The vari-angle screen on the back is excellent. You switch to Live View by pressing a button on the back of the camera and you can then use the touch control to set the focus point and change camera settings. It's sharp, colourful and clear and the touch response is awesome. Apart from the mechanical noise when the mirror is flipped up to enter Live View mode, this is just like using a mirrorless camera, as the autofocus response is just as rapid.

One thing I Don't understand why Canon Stores images only 72DPI while Nikon stores at 300DPI? Can any one explain this?

4K video is a big selling point on this camera, but you do notice a couple of limitations , there's a significant 'crop factor' in 4K mode, which means your lens's angle of view effectively becomes narrower. Any how, I am not much using videos.

Battery life is good and last for longer period.

Pros:
Very light and compact DSLR
Dual pixel AF
Great Live View auto focus response
Vari-angle touchscreen
Simple but effective controls
Builtin WiFi & Bluetooth.

Cons:
Only 9 AF points in viewfinder shooting.
Not compatible for 3rd party flash must go with Canon only.
No USB charging. No GPS."
13512,4.0,Best one just go for it if you are a beginner
13513,4.0,Best camera in this price range ..👍📷
13514,4.0,In our budget it is best camera
13515,4.0,"My perfect DSLR got in 56k during sell on Amazon. It's my first DSLR and I'm pretty happy with it. Face detection + eye detection is just awesome. You'll get duel pixel auto focus with 1080p videos. Just loved everything about this camera.

Guided display:
- This is something great when you are beginner. Every action of yours shows you results.

Simple interface:
- As it's canon dslr it's interface is pretty simple anyone can learn in just few minutes.

Processor:
- It's all new digic 8 processor is really faster enough to capture great images out of it.

Bettery life:
- Awesome Bettery life in compare to older 200D. Can take almost double shot then older one in single charge.

Variangle Touchscreen Display:
- It's Touch sensitivity is really so good. You can do almost all function through its touch screen. Also it can be used to check frame while shooting youtube videos.

Wireless connection:
- This feature makes this camera best in this price segment. You can operate your camera remotely through Wi-Fi also can download images directly to your phone through Bluetooth/wifi.

Face detection along with eye detection:
- 200D II now offers eye detection while shooting videos which is 1 step ahead from older 200D. Must require feature in DSLR for videography.

4K video:
- In this price range its offers shooting in 4K which works great if you have wide angle lens.

Offers edit RAW:
- You can edit RAW images directly in your camera which is again great feature this camera offers.

Value for money:
- With all these great features in this price range i can surely say that it's a good value for money camera for specially for beginners."
13516,4.0,"It only supports TTL flash, which will cost around 8000+ else u need to buy a trigger which will cost around 3500"
13517,4.0,Nice for 200d mark 2
13518,4.0,"First DSLR
Works like a charm"
13519,3.0,"A tiny body with marvellous brain.Auto focus is excellent but I only shot 93 pictures till date but hope it will satisfy.
For beginners it is a great learning tool. I have Nikon D 800E,D810 but they have no touch screen only D850 has. Canon in this price bracket provides touch screen .Canon has a legendary auto ISO function. In RAW file It will be have no need to touch ISO SLIDER. Color rendition is superb.Canon understands the Indian complexion well.Beginners can use every possible mode to gain experience.
Picture quality is extraordinary .Above all the lens is very good according to picture quality but build quality is not good with plastic mount. I used canon 350 D, 40D,50D,60D, 5D MK II but canon lenses are fungus prone the L series lenses were loaded with fungus. The cheap lenses deteriorate in image quality rapidly due to fungus infestation.
Overall it’s a excellent camera to begin with.
The service of Amazon is exemplary .The camera came 2days before but the advertisement showed the lens was 18-55mm f/4 I ordered it for that reason but the seller supplied me 18-55mm f /4-5.6 .It is a sheer breach of contract."
13520,3.0,Very good product for beginner..... Good quality product in this price segment.. .. Image quality is pretty good with 18-55 kit lens..... With 50 mm lens it will far better
13521,3.0,"Excellent VFM, especially if you are getting the dual kit version. I had a 1500D and was happy with it but gave it away as I needed one with Wifi/BT support.

Canon EOS 200D II is an excellent beginner's DSLR. It's a Canon, so there is absolutely no compromise in the quality. The kit lens 18-55mm is decent for regular snaps, and the 55-250mm Zoom Lens is excellent for long range shots. The OS is easy to understand and within a few hours/days you will be fairly comfortable with the DSLR and would love to snap away. Attaching some samples.

However, I would strongly encourage you to get Prime lens. Either EF 50mm f/1.8 (excellent VFM at ~8.9k INR) or EF 50mm f/1.4 USM lens, and the 10-18mm wide angle lens.

Overall, Excellent APC-C DSLR which is VFM."
13522,4.0,"Awesome camera in this budget..
Have lot of features though sometimes you may feel the 5fps is a bit slow when trying to capture birds of rain drops or something like that.
55-250 lens is amazing & you must buy that otherwise you will miss a lot of opportunities that you can get with this lens.

On YouTube everyone says this is light though as my first camera i didn't feel it is too light with 250 lens though i don't know how heavy other dslr are..
All 4 photos taken at 250 mm full zoom.. you won't get big moon with even 250mm, i think atleast 400mm is required.
Overall a great purchase for this budget.."
13523,3.0,Received this product on proper schedule. But I was waiting for Rakshabandhan to click photographs. Till 10 August I was using basic 18-55 mm lense to click photographs. But today I decided to try clicking photos using 55-250 mm lense but I noticed white spot on lense and that was from inside. I tried replace the product option but executive was unable to help to return/ replace product considering price of the product. She escalated to his senior and even he was not helpful. She commited about return call by tomorrow and said she raised incident. But I didn't got any mail notification or not even incident number was shared with me. Tomorrow is the last date of returning product.
13524,4.0,This is one of the best camera for beginners.
13525,3.0,"I got it during the Diwali sale. The camera performs pretty well.
The screen and the controls are very user friendly, easy to get used to.
It also suggests you which mode and when to use them when you want to move away from auto.

As the lens provided is not of the range f/1.8 or below, the bokeh effect in low light isn't that pretty. But in daylight bokeh effect is really good while shooting portraits even with the kit lens.
Along with the kit lens, 55-250mm telephoto lens was also provided. It works well, the stability and auto focus of the shots is amazing.

The battery performance is really good. Lasts for a long time and charges quickly.
If it's your first camera and you don't want to buy older models, this DSLR camera is worth it's price.

I have added some handheld moon shots which are pretty stable, and other pictures i took on this camera."
13526,4.0,"Good for beginners and autofocus is also good. Picture quality is excellent and anyone with minimum knowledge can take good photos.

13530,4.0,"1.I did not receive the 16 GB memory card along with the camera
2. The camera has come without the bag"
13531,5.0,Better to buy this product at outside because they are not providing a camera bag & a single memory card also .
13532,3.0,"Best crop sensor DSLR in this price range. I wish we could have more cross type autofocus point. But if you are looking for a cam which is good in photography and videography, this is one of the best option."
13533,3.0,"Product physical quality is good... but poor performance in insude room use... picture quality is very poor. I have tried many photo settings... but very low quality of photograph. I think normal mobile camera of 24 mp is better than this product... item not used in outside... need to check outside photography... item cost is very high compare to picture quality.... canon company needs to improve the the megapixel , satisfied with out side photography. Memory card is 16 gb only.... Hence need to purchase 128 gb for video recording purpose.."
13534,3.0,"DSLR quality always depends on both body and lens. Camera body autofocus is great specially in the video. Easy to shoot cinematic videos as autofocus is too smooth. Coming to the lens it is just kit lens with aperture starting at 4, so don't expect razor-sharp image indoor. Up to 800 ISO, there is no visible noise. At 1600 ISO you will see little noise if you view in 100% the actual size of the photo. For 4x6 or 5x7 it will not noticeable. Just buy an additional lens, like 50 mm, and you will get awesome indoor and low light photos and videos. Camera is great in this price range. IF you have photographic or video graphic hobby then go for it without second thought"

13577,4.0,"Product physical quality is good... but poor performance in insude room use... picture quality is very poor. I have tried many photo settings... but very low quality of photograph. I think normal mobile camera of 24 mp is better than this product... item not used in outside... need to check outside photography... item cost is very high compare to picture quality.... canon company needs to improve the the megapixel , satisfied with out side photography. Memory card is 16 gb only.... Hence need to purchase 128 gb for video recording purpose.."
13578,5.0,"DSLR quality always depends on both body and lens. Camera body autofocus is great specially in the video. Easy to shoot cinematic videos as autofocus is too smooth. Coming to the lens it is just kit lens with aperture starting at 4, so don't expect razor-sharp image indoor. Up to 800 ISO, there is no visible noise. At 1600 ISO you will see little noise if you view in 100% the actual size of the photo. For 4x6 or 5x7 it will not noticeable. Just buy an additional lens, like 50 mm, and you will get awesome indoor and low light photos and videos. Camera is great in this price range. IF you have photographic or video graphic hobby then go for it without second thought"

13582,3.0,"i am reviewing after 2 months of ownership of this camera. camera is best under 50k budget, i wanted a dslr which can do both photography & cinematography, 200d mark 2 do the great job in both. i also have other options which is canon m50, but i buy this because it have so many no. of lenses and they are cheaper than the mirrorless camera lenses, m50 have low battery performance also."

13614,5.0,"At first I really enjoyed the wide shots and the picture quality was decent. Eventually after a couple of uses it just stopped working. No idea why,"
13615,5.0,"I liked the easy operation of loading and taking the photos. In bright sunlight, I suggest to use the darken mode. Photos are clear and colours, vivid and accurate. Against a white background, photos tend to overexpose. Selfie, close up mirror is easy to attach. Landscape photos are the most accurate and pleasing."

13617,5.0,"It would be great if we receive the films along with the camera. It's hard to buy separately. And still now didn't use this product . Just a waste purchase. Not interested to use also further .

13618,5.0,"This is not working and no picture is coming, i would like to return it!"
13619,5.0,"You can buy this variant if you want wider photos unlike the mini and sq6 cameras. The camera is noticeably big in size but not very heavy. Less options while clicking pictures. Having said that. if you improve your photo clicking skills the experience can be satisfactory. I personally chose this camera for capturing family events, group photos and some landscape photography for which this camera is good."
13620,5.0,"It is a great thing to carry while travelling.
Pros:
- sturdy
- simple mechanism
- great puctures in daylight
- instant giveaways to people you meet

Cons
- bulky size, more than an avg DSLR
- pictures with flash tend to be devoid of info, background is often lost in it
- inability to work well in dim light
- expensive films, each picture costs around 55INR.

Having said that, i personally enjoy owning this camera. It is bulky as compared to Instax mini models but the picture size is definately substantial and gives a feeling of nostalgia (I owed a Mini 70). It is departure from the 100 pictures we take from the phone and barely ever look back to."
13621,5.0,"This is the second time I am purchasing a Fuji Instax Wide. I don't know what they use to make the product. But the last one too was faulty and did not have a long life. This time it lasted even shorter. All I got to shoot was one pack and now all my pictures come out blank and the flash also does not fire (not that it has any correlation). The camera starts normally, everything works fine even the shutter clicks. But the photo is always blank. This is so frustrating. After having spent such a big sum on this camera. The website of Fujifilm India does not have any service center even in Mumbai. I need to email the website to ask if there is any service center. This is such a negative experience !"
13622,4.0,"As an moderately experienced photographer owning a DSLR and an SLR, having an instant camera was just for fun and the instax wide 300 is a great buy if you just want to have some fun. However if you’re looking to get creative with this particular model of the instax line up, you’ll be let down. It doesn’t even have a timer.
I personally never found myself needing the timer, but for those of you who do will have to look for something else.
In the film cartridge department, the wide cartridges are quite limited for now and as it seems they don’t look like they are going to introduce any new fun cartridges."
13623,5.0,"It is definitely not a hand held device it is even bigger than a DSLR. so think before buying instax mini 11 is much better, difference is o film size but smaller film looks much more presentable i.e. instax mini 11 film"
13624,4.0,"I love love this camera. Takes really great wide pictures as long as there is enough light. Make sure to keep the light in mind otherwise the photos turn out to be black. Even an bright evening setting won't do, it has to be really lit up. The more sun, the better. Use a flash at 1/2 for indoors."
13625,5.0,"Worst picture print quality plz dont buy this, I myself m regretting"
13626,5.0,"I love this camera. I was torn between this and the fuji mini 90 neo. But I am glad i chose this one. I love wide films and the pictures come out very well. The facial features and the background etc are clearly visible. My sister has the fuji neo, and though it is better looking, the pictures are so small. And definitely not worth a memory
This camera has a plastic feel to it but its durable. Selfies however do not come out that well with this camera. It doesn't have many features, but it's definitely worth a buy. I have bought 8 films upto now and i love using it."
13627,5.0,"I liked the photos from this camera
I disliked that I didn't recieve the tripod as mentioned"
13628,4.0,Amazing ! Amazing! Amazing camera! Fabulous features with light mode adjustments. It’s value is even quite in the range for people.I got it during the amazon sale period for really cheap! It's really worth buying coz this one gives you bigger proportionate pictures unlike the small ones. It’s quite simple to use and gives the most fabulous results in open areas. The quality of the picture is also without a doubt really good. I have had previous experiences with polaroid camera but this one is by far the best I have come across. It's really great choice for people who wish to buy a Polaroid camera
13629,5.0,"The camera has just not come on ever since I received it. Having to contact the Fujifilm service centre, get the camera delivered to get it checked and to be told that their is probably an issue with the board itself has not been pleasant to say the least. Unhappy with the service provided."
13630,5.0,Pictures are good only in bright lighting. Good camera for outdoor memories.
13631,3.0,Guys this is a lot of fun camera...!! It shoots nice within 3 feet... And you get an awesome photo. But don't expect a very good pixel high definition photo.... It is nice but not as a digital photo print. Also the big headache is the film which is more expensive. But after all we need fun right!! With less film 😜
13632,5.0,It is a value for money product. The build quality is average. The photos has a vintage feel. The product should be handled with care.
13633,5.0,"This is by far the best insta camera. Only problem is weight it is quite heavy to carry around. This print the widest picture.
Please buy the right refill. This has wide film"

13636,5.0,"I received the camera a week ago and because I didn’t have the reel by that time, I couldn’t check how to use it. I received the reel today and found out that the camera isn’t working. Neither is the flash. All the pictures are coming out completely blank and the box was also missing a few items named on it."
13637,4.0,"Not the best quality - but it’s the best the market had to offer right now - it’s the only camera that shoots wide! I think, Fuji will improve on this. The flash is erratic - has a mind of it’s own."
13638,4.0,I got a very bad piece wer the camera lens shutter was not opening wen we switch on the power button very disappointed for this cos spent sooo much I got disappointment.giveing back the camera not happy. At all please refund my money as soon as possible

13642,5.0,No issues with the device.
13643,4.0,"Wonderful, wonderful product. It's one f my purchases which is really close to my heart. The user needs a basic knowledge of lighting, composition to use this."

13648,4.0,Not bad. Dont buy if you expect high quality photos.

But didnt get the free 10 film along with it"
13662,5.0,It is just ok. Nothing great. It's like a New Camera for those who have grown up with Old Style cameras. It reminds us of those days and gives us the excitement of getting pictures instantly. But the picture quality is very so-so.

13713,5.0,Well it compete with top brands of Epson & HP products.
13714,5.0,"After having frustrating experience with HP printer with its expensive cost of printing (70Rs/ print) we have chosen Canon G3000 printer after carefully reviewing the feedback on choices we have i.e. Brother, Epson and Canon; however disappointed with the performance. Whatever the product is i must accept it, this is only to share my views and not in any negative sense.

Starting with Pros:
- Printer comes with plenty of Ink and that will probably provide ROI with in 2 years considering cost of printing with HP.
- Tech support is too fast, they sent an engineer within 2 hours placing request.

What is not working:
- This is not a simple plug-n-play printer, the behavior of the printer requires good knowledge of how this works. For e.g. you have to leave the printer on for 5 minutes before you start printing. My exp previous printer is almost flawless and smooth.
- Print quality is pale, dull. What you see on screen is not what you get; this conclusion is after comparing printouts taken from earlier printer. However a good point is that the text is sharp.
- Software is difficult to trace, operate and use. Not sure why the software is provided in first place when you can directly fire printout without installing this software.

The above issues i have mentioned are some thing you cant understand/ check when you purchase online."
13715,5.0,"1. Time to get print,
Black and white - 5-6 seconds
Colour- 25-30 seconds
2. You have to take atleast 1 colour copy daily and also do ''Cleaning'' once in 2 days (using Maintenance tab in printer properties). Otherwise, you may have to do Deep cleaning or system cleaning which may consume half of your ink..
3. It will shows errors at the time of paper jam or no ink etc. Some errors would not be solved even after printer off and on. For every error there are certain techniques for solution using Power, Stop and Color buttons. You can search in YouTube for such solutions. No need to call technical team.
4. The printer is noisy..
6. No. of pages per refill depends on how we use the printer.. I think I get approx,
Black and white- 2000-3000
Colour- 2000-3000
Pls note, for Black & White we need only one ink bottle. For colour, we need 3 ink bottles
5. I bought it before 3 years. No complaint till now.
Before you buy the printer, please ensure the availability of Original canon ink and its price.."

13718,4.0,"I have bee using Canon PixmaG 300 since few years. Recently I had a problem as the printer colour output was showing only one colour I called the customer care. A technitian came and took the printer. He brought back the printer the next day. But the quality of printing was bad as the colours were not perfect but hazy. I refused to pay till The printer is in proper order. The technitian left saying that his boss would call. His boss called and his attitude was very careless and unproffessional. I had to shout back at him. He said I have to change the heads if I want a good print and he also said 'are you printing xerox copies ? For your home yoy dont need good quality."" I got angry and asked him why I was not informed before I objected about poor print quality. The so called Boss was very rude and used abusive foul dreregotery language. This is how Canon customer care treats customers."

I advice u guys to choose some other brand who is ready to basic trouble shooting through call instead of waiting to charge on us"
13722,5.0,Very easy to install
13723,5.0,"Got it for less than 10k in 2019. Primarily for the kids usage and occasional copying of documents and scanning for my usage. The idea was the ink tank is cheaper than cartridge overall. Except for a couple of occassions when left unused for too long(used full head clean to get it to work properly), this works satisfactorily and serves the purpose. Inkjet speed is slower, so it takes a moment to print even when copying, but the delay isn't noticeable since usage at home doesn't involve long queues. I use wifi primarily and it's a bit of a chore when you change your wifi - else it's simple enough to use. Scanner is great and configurable for different speeds and dpi.

I tested this to print on photo paper which was as good as photos professionally printed. Since this is jet, if there is problem with any color it generally gives out Grey's on regular paper. I printed about 1.5 reams of A4, with around quarter of Inks still available. Rough math about 3 rupee per page including colors.

The software for printing is not the simplest, but for a regular user it won't be rocket science either. Overall since it's an inkjet primarily for home use, it's not a bad deal or bad product.

Can be better but given a choice i will happily buy it again since it's the cheapest and best value for money in the branded inkjet printers."

My point is that I wasted almost 3 hours trying to setup WIFI without connecting to a PC. Is it not better to set up the printer by connecting it to a computer right at the beginning?

Apart from this issue, the printer is excellent."

13735,5.0,"I ordered this printer yesterday i.e. on 24-5-2022 and recieved the delivery on the next day.
However, when i recived the printer it was not packed in default Amazon packing, there was just a black seal around the box with Amazon logo. This was quite awkward and doubt full for me. Now let's talk about the printer- ink filling is very easy there is no way you end up filling the wrong color in wrong tank ( unless if you are color blind ) same goes for print head installation. Before installation of drivers and softwares on pc make sure you are done with initialization of the printer, following the manual. Other wise you will experience errors especially on wifi installation..
Unfortunately for me in my first print during printing the alignment through the installation setup my sheet ( A4 ) got stucked and i had hard time fixing it, ( i had to remove print heads to removed the torned stucked piece of paper beneath them) but it was solved later. after re-trying printing went well. I have no idea why it happened at first. The last concerning thing i found is the indicator light, i had accidentally touched one and they ""move"" along with others. So i can say built quality is fair, a delicate thing.
Overall the printer is good. I will update more later."
13736,5.0,Very good printer with wifi feature
13737,3.0,"Its an initial review. SO after using it for 10-15 times, i must say it delivered great quality color photos on glossy paper. I used 4×6 & A4 glossy photo paper. Got 2 extra refills of black color. And the consumption of ink is quite efficient. Speed is good enough for me at office as well as at home. So no complaints yet. Will update review after using for 3-4 months."
13738,4.0,Color printing is not effective. red shade colors are not working
13739,3.0,"I bought the product at a steal value, which is good.

Although I was aware that there is no LCD screen to guide me thorough the menus, my geekiness will support me, I was sure.

Installation with my computer via WiFi router was pretty easy. Did a few tries to locate the printer on my network and tried the button shortcuts and finally got it connected.

Prints were good. Ink seems to be drained a lot as 3 prints on, I could see about 15 percent drop in the ink levels. Need to ascertain it in the long duration.

Now comes the tricky part. I wanted to connect it to my phone and another phone not on my WiFi router network. I installed the Canon ""Print"" app and it was not detecting my printer.

I tried detecting WiFi direct devices but was not able to see the printer. After a few tries with the button shortcuts, I was able to locate it in the regular WiFi devices. I connected to the WiFi printer and was able to at least connect the phone to the printer directly. Prints and scans were again possible.

Then came the real headache. The printer was not getting detected by the computer now. By some unknown reasons, this printer is not able to connect to both services, WiFi direct (act as hotspot) and regular WiFi (access a hotspot) simultaneously.

My previous WiFi MFD, a 5000 rupee HP was easier to install, easier to understand and connect and had none of the aforementioned WiFi issues!

I called up the Canon customer care (18002083366) on Saturday and raised a service request. service guy will visit my in 24 hours, I was told. Come Tuesday, I still didn't get the service call atleast.

I gave them a call on Tuesday morning and reiterated the issue. They gave me a local service number. After a few hours, I got a call and I had to tell them the whole story again. Second installation is not free, I was told. I said that the first installation was done by myself. They agreed to come by evening.

Evening they gave excuses that they were caught up with other customers and don't even have the courtesy to lift my phone. I'm still waiting. Will update after they actual arrive. I just hope the service rep has better skills than myself.

I'm pretty sure it's not an issue which can be sorted out onsite. There might be shop servicing needed. I should have gone with Amazon return as I'm still within that period. But I'm being a gentleman, for now.

Update : Gentleman's patience broke. I got a replacement. Problem persists another way.
I realised my 12k Canon printer can only act as either a wifi-direct printer or can access an external WiFi router, but cannot do both, like my 5k HP printer.
The technicians reply made it clear. Sir, canon doesn't have any models in the sub-15k range which can be accessed by laptops vide wifi router and at the same time by accessed by phones vide wifi Direct! Thumbs down.

The printer however served its purpose of printing well in standard and best modes. Draft mode had lines showing up on an otherwise splendid photo.

Another irritating problem with this device is the scanning application. Competitors need to learn from HP. Their scanning apps were so user friendly. This one in yet to find easy ways to scan proud or documents readily with my required settings by default. Not at all user friendly. Instead it pops up like some irritating ads we get online!

Overall, this is an ok device for the rate. The only saving grace are the ciss, which for now works great and the decent print quality for standard and best modes. So far so good."
13740,3.0,Wifi not working but still print good
13741,1.0,"Yes off course I like this printer 🖨️
It's good for students. But when we take colour prints in glossy paper it quality is some what poor. But b and wht it is best, easy to connect to phone, Xerox is good, scan works better than i expected, good for this budget. Go for it no other confution"
13742,4.0,It's been quite a few years and running good. You have to run this printer otherwise it will get dry. The Technician assembled my printer is very helpful whenever I call him he help me. So I would say service is best. Even after warranty.
13743,5.0,"Best Product by cannon in this price range.very good printing , photocopy"
13744,1.0,"I am writing this review on this printer after using it for over a year. In this year, I printed about 2000+ pages both color and black&white. So my review is based on observations on them.

=== Print Quality ===
This is definitely the brightest point with this printer. I used Epson ink tank printer earlier and were not satisfied with the results of it. But this Canon printer makes the cut. I am amazed to see the results of the printing both color and B&W. I printed many photos on photo papers and the results were better than the inkjet printers.

=== Ink Longevity ===
This is another biggest selling point of this printer. The printer came with 4 ink bottles - Black, Cyan, Magenta, Yellow. After printing over 2000 pages so far (photos and documents) I still see 50% of the ink left.

=== Ease of Use ===
I can connect this to my wifi router and get started in 5 minutes. All I need is to read the instructions carefully. And voila, all my devices - Computer, Laptop, Mobile and iPad - can print without any hassles. They can detect the printer and starts printing just in minute.

=== Paper Feeding ===
In my more than one year experience with this printer, I never faced a single paper jam. If at all something happens, check paper feeder if any small objects stuck accidentally.

=== Scanner ===
Not used much but overall quality was ok. If you want crystal clear scans, this is not for you.

=== Copier ===
Its just a click of button. Keep your document inside the scanner and click on blabk or color button. Your document copy is ready.

=== Issues ===
So far I came across only one issue. The printer orange light starts blinking and the messages shows that the ink cleaner bed was overflown and needs a service. But I followed the instructions on Youtube videos, cleaned the ink cleaning bed and cartridges for 4 to 5 times and then the printer came back to normal. But this took over 4 hours to understand and solve the issue.

=== Advice ===
1. Do not perform system cleaning too many times. This will cause overflowing of tank on ink cleaner bed and malfunction your primter.
2. Do not use cheap paper, use paper such as JK Sparkle etc.
3. Do not print photo prints on normal paper, use photo paper or thick paper.
4. Make sure to print few papers at least once a week with all colors. This will reduce color logging inside the tubes.

Overall, I am very satisfied with this printer and the quality of prints it gives you.

Update 11/11/19
I faced one more issue after long time. The printer unable to feed the paper and I couldn't find any object inside the feed. After two days of struggling I came up with an idea of reverse feeding the paper from inside the printer, i.e. open the top box to see printer inside and switch off and onthe printer. While stopping, it reverses spinning wheel and load paper manually to it just in time. Voila, it started."

13751,5.0,I used to use earlier however deskjet printer. It was utter waste as cost per print exorbitantly high. Went for this Canon inkjet printer. Printed 100 plus sheets. Still the ink remains at same level.

13755,4.0,"The print quality is excellent. Printing speed is great for black. For colour, it is reasonably okay. Two side printing would have helped a lot.

It was easy to install. YouTube videos helped. Tech support was not required.

The only complaint I have is that the yellow ink level automatically went down fast, though it was initially equal to the cyan and magenta ink levels.

Wifi connectivity helps a lot in printing. One PDF got printed via desktop correctly, but got blank pages via the Canon Print Inkjet app on mobile.

Overall, it is a great buy."
13756,4.0,Printing is very slow 🦥🦥 with a loud sound
13757,4.0,"Chose canon over others due to its mega reputation and Classy size & shape.Its all-in-one ability supersedes all contemporary brands.

Here are my few observations of the product :

1.) Its an ink tank printer that comes with separate ink tanks to be filled with ink red , yellow , blue & black .Its always considered to be more economical for per page printing and should be chosen if you have bulk work on a routine basis.

In these ink tank printers, it is also required to take prints on a minimum weekly basis or prolonged non-usage may lead to drying of heads .

2.) The construction of the printer is very elegant and solid and the ink tanks are absorbed in the regular chassis of the printer unlike HP brand, however it is my personal preference.

Solid doesn't mean you can afford to drop it , it means the plastic used for construction feels very premium and rigid.

3.) Regarding functionality - It can scan and print documents very fast .Page size supported is from 4.0""x 6.0"" photo paper to A4 ,Letter ,Legal , A5 , B5 .

I purchased glossy kodak photo papers 280 GSM & paperone A4 100 GSM papers and the print quality was excellent.

For pictures , it takes few minutes but its worth the wait .If you choose the right paper the photos are bound to be very good ,However at few places i found the shade of green slightly dark in print than in actual photo that was scanned.

Resolution is good for both photos and documents.

Printing makes slight noise but is tolerable , its not like neighbour or even other room person will be disturbed.

4.) Got it with additional warranty for onsite repair for next 2 years.

5.) I bought it first then realized i don't have that much work to use it on daily basis so i would ask my readers to buy only if you have routine works or make use of shops."
13758,5.0,Connecting the printer to your Wi-Fi for Air print is little hectic as you need to follow the documentation from canon website. Other wise everything was smooth.

13762,4.0,Well it compete with top brands of Epson & HP products.
13763,3.0,"After having frustrating experience with HP printer with its expensive cost of printing (70Rs/ print) we have chosen Canon G3000 printer after carefully reviewing the feedback on choices we have i.e. Brother, Epson and Canon; however disappointed with the performance. Whatever the product is i must accept it, this is only to share my views and not in any negative sense.

Starting with Pros:
- Printer comes with plenty of Ink and that will probably provide ROI with in 2 years considering cost of printing with HP.
- Tech support is too fast, they sent an engineer within 2 hours placing request.

What is not working:
- This is not a simple plug-n-play printer, the behavior of the printer requires good knowledge of how this works. For e.g. you have to leave the printer on for 5 minutes before you start printing. My exp previous printer is almost flawless and smooth.
- Print quality is pale, dull. What you see on screen is not what you get; this conclusion is after comparing printouts taken from earlier printer. However a good point is that the text is sharp.
- Software is difficult to trace, operate and use. Not sure why the software is provided in first place when you can directly fire printout without installing this software.
- Very difficult to understand error codes. The power on light is blinking indicating that there is no paper, however the problem is some thing else.

The above issues i have mentioned are some thing you cant understand/ check when you purchase online."

It's good for students. But when we take colour prints in glossy paper it quality is some what poor. But b and wht it is best, easy to connect to phone, Xerox is good, scan works better than i expected, good for this budget. Go for it no other confution"
13791,1.0,It's been quite a few years and running good. You have to run this printer otherwise it will get dry. The Technician assembled my printer is very helpful whenever I call him he help me. So I would say service is best. Even after warranty.
13792,4.0,"Best Product by cannon in this price range.very good printing , photocopy"
13793,5.0,"I am writing this review on this printer after using it for over a year. In this year, I printed about 2000+ pages both color and black&white. So my review is based on observations on them.

=== Print Quality ===
This is definitely the brightest point with this printer. I used Epson ink tank printer earlier and were not satisfied with the results of it. But this Canon printer makes the cut. I am amazed to see the results of the printing both color and B&W. I printed many photos on photo papers and the results were better than the inkjet printers.

=== Ink Longevity ===
This is another biggest selling point of this printer. The printer came with 4 ink bottles - Black, Cyan, Magenta, Yellow. After printing over 2000 pages so far (photos and documents) I still see 50% of the ink left.

=== Ease of Use ===
I can connect this to my wifi router and get started in 5 minutes. All I need is to read the instructions carefully. And voila, all my devices - Computer, Laptop, Mobile and iPad - can print without any hassles. They can detect the printer and starts printing just in minute.

=== Paper Feeding ===
In my more than one year experience with this printer, I never faced a single paper jam. If at all something happens, check paper feeder if any small objects stuck accidentally.

=== Scanner ===
Not used much but overall quality was ok. If you want crystal clear scans, this is not for you.

=== Copier ===
Its just a click of button. Keep your document inside the scanner and click on blabk or color button. Your document copy is ready.

=== Issues ===
So far I came across only one issue. The printer orange light starts blinking and the messages shows that the ink cleaner bed was overflown and needs a service. But I followed the instructions on Youtube videos, cleaned the ink cleaning bed and cartridges for 4 to 5 times and then the printer came back to normal. But this took over 4 hours to understand and solve the issue.

=== Advice ===
1. Do not perform system cleaning too many times. This will cause overflowing of tank on ink cleaner bed and malfunction your primter.
2. Do not use cheap paper, use paper such as JK Sparkle etc.
3. Do not print photo prints on normal paper, use photo paper or thick paper.
4. Make sure to print few papers at least once a week with all colors. This will reduce color logging inside the tubes.

Overall, I am very satisfied with this printer and the quality of prints it gives you.

Update 11/11/19
I faced one more issue after long time. The printer unable to feed the paper and I couldn't find any object inside the feed. After two days of struggling I came up with an idea of reverse feeding the paper from inside the printer, i.e. open the top box to see printer inside and switch off and onthe printer. While stopping, it reverses spinning wheel and load paper manually to it just in time. Voila, it started."

13800,5.0,I used to use earlier however deskjet printer. It was utter waste as cost per print exorbitantly high. Went for this Canon inkjet printer. Printed 100 plus sheets. Still the ink remains at same level.
13801,5.0,"Bought this product at 14k approx, for installation I had to follow a few Youtube videos.
The printer makes Noise while printing, Not as smooth as i expected, The print is good Not that fine as expected from Cannon.
Overall considerable product."
13802,1.0,exellent quality printer
13803,4.0,"Lines show on glosy paper 180 gsm while printing colour photo
Its my first printer so not so much experience but yes it’s easy to install and easy to use"
13804,4.0,"The print quality is excellent. Printing speed is great for black. For colour, it is reasonably okay. Two side printing would have helped a lot.

It was easy to install. YouTube videos helped. Tech support was not required.

The only complaint I have is that the yellow ink level automatically went down fast, though it was initially equal to the cyan and magenta ink levels.

Wifi connectivity helps a lot in printing. One PDF got printed via desktop correctly, but got blank pages via the Canon Print Inkjet app on mobile.

Overall, it is a great buy."
13805,4.0,Printing is very slow 🦥🦥 with a loud sound
13806,4.0,"Chose canon over others due to its mega reputation and Classy size & shape.Its all-in-one ability supersedes all contemporary brands.

Here are my few observations of the product :

1.) Its an ink tank printer that comes with separate ink tanks to be filled with ink red , yellow , blue & black .Its always considered to be more economical for per page printing and should be chosen if you have bulk work on a routine basis.

In these ink tank printers, it is also required to take prints on a minimum weekly basis or prolonged non-usage may lead to drying of heads .

2.) The construction of the printer is very elegant and solid and the ink tanks are absorbed in the regular chassis of the printer unlike HP brand, however it is my personal preference.

Solid doesn't mean you can afford to drop it , it means the plastic used for construction feels very premium and rigid.

3.) Regarding functionality - It can scan and print documents very fast .Page size supported is from 4.0""x 6.0"" photo paper to A4 ,Letter ,Legal , A5 , B5 .

I purchased glossy kodak photo papers 280 GSM & paperone A4 100 GSM papers and the print quality was excellent.

For pictures , it takes few minutes but its worth the wait .If you choose the right paper the photos are bound to be very good ,However at few places i found the shade of green slightly dark in print than in actual photo that was scanned.

Resolution is good for both photos and documents.

Printing makes slight noise but is tolerable , its not like neighbour or even other room person will be disturbed.

4.) Got it with additional warranty for onsite repair for next 2 years.

5.) I bought it first then realized i don't have that much work to use it on daily basis so i would ask my readers to buy only if you have routine works or make use of shops."
13807,4.0,Connecting the printer to your Wi-Fi for Air print is little hectic as you need to follow the documentation from canon website. Other wise everything was smooth.

13809,1.0,Good
13810,5.0,Thanks
13811,5.0,"If you are purchasing it for your home use, don't look any further. It has got all the functions you'll find in a 20-30k worth printers. All in one includes print, scan, copy and fax as well, Colour, adf, duplex printing, wifi. You download the app in ur phone and give print commands via mobile itself. Only two issue that I faced, firstly the print quality(which I'll speak to the service center) and secondly is the total quantity of color prints. I have only taken out couple of color printouts bad already the level of ink is 90%. I guess I'll have to purchase a larger cartridge."
13812,4.0,"I bought this item in August 2022, and the delivery and packaging was as good and sturdy as I've come to expect from Amazon. Using the printer from my Macbook is a breeze over wifi, although printing over wifi from Android requires some poorly designed app from Canon and has no direct support.

The only couple of issues I faced with this printer were during setup.
1. Scanning the qr code for the setup guide didn't actually lead to much of a guide, rather a boilerplate page. I would only much later find out the way from that page to the actual guide. Canon could do a better job of surfacing the online guide, as the image clarity in the included hard copy is quite poor.
2. Installation of cartridges seemed to take forever - I must have removed and re-inserted them almost 5 times before they were properly detected. No error messages showed up, and I didn't know if I had recieved a faulty product, or if I was doing something wrong.
3. Never having owned a printer, and always using either copy shops or the huge laser printers at work, I ended up making a mistake in setting up the paper tray, leading to a jam at the first print itself. Thankfully it was straightforward to open up the printer from the back side and remove the torn pieces. Canon could do a better job of demonstrating how to set up the paper sheets - clearer access to the online guide might've helped here.

Except for the these minor concerns in setup, I'm enjoying using this printer surprisingly, since printers (alongside projectors ) are usually the worst items ever developed by the electronics industry. I've used all the features so far - print ( colored, double sided), scan and copy and not faced any issues with quality, wifi or the cartridges.

13814,4.0,"Cannon E4570.
This was launched as a successor for E4270 (I searched everywhere but couldn't find a credible source to explain the differences between the two). I researched extensively before purchase to find a printer which will fullfil the following criteria for me - wifi enabled (so that we can print with smartphone without opening the laptop), clear color print (decent for child's homework, photo quality not required) and cheap to run. E4270 seem to fit all the criteria, so I ordered this. Even the canon authorised showroom didn't have E4570 in stock, so ordered the E4570 off Amazon.
Summary - fullfills top two criteria. Though is a little expensive if you do more than the occasional print.

Delivery was 3 days earlier than the delivery date shown on Amazon, so that was great. It was just the printer box, with no outer packing. The box was sealed with cello tape, and not sealed, so I suspect it had been opened at some point. Thankfully, all the components were there, and the seal on the printer and cartridges were intact, so i was ok with the delivery.

Setup was smooth on both my smartphone and laptop over wifi. I never had to use the usb cable. Setup was through the canon app on phone and the canon website (link for both given in manual), which guides step by step on how to setup. I did not face any challenges and the setup and printing has been smooth from all devices.

Color prints are a bit faded on plain paper (75gsm). This might be a function of the paper and not the printer. The black&white prints are crisp and sharp. The print speed is decent.

The only negative is the amount of ink consumption. While the box says 180 color prints and 300 b&w, both my cartridges are showing at 80% after 4 color print and around 30 b&w. Specially for color prints, the printer tends to drop the cartridge level by a notch after just 2-3 prints. I suspect the color cartridge will not last longer that 30-40 full color pages. Refilling the cartridges a few times is of course an option, but it is messy and requires practice. This is fine for me as I need color prints very rarely.

A special mention for the ADF and duplex printing. Both the features are extremely useful. Duplex printing is especially unique in this price range, and comes in very handy while printing larger documents.

Overall, I am happy with my purchase after couple of weeks of usage. I will update the review if I run into any issues."
13815,4.0,Everything is good but just print approx 250 pages and cartridge ink goes down
13816,5.0,After 20days of usage ..I'm unable to print as it is showing black ink running low ..i have print only 100pages ...and in description they told that 400pages yield thats totally wrong
13817,4.0,Need to lower the exposure for every scanned image.
13818,4.0,Too slow printing. Always paper jammed if u put bulk paper on tray. Only single paper print good... which is very headache
13819,4.0,"Good printer but
-Even if u print in monochrome it uses colour ink.. meaning even if u print in b&w it still uses a little colour ink
- U can't print if one of the ink is empty both have to installed and full( in my hp inkjet printer It prints even if i remove coloured cartridge)
-bought the one with smart speaker for 8300 which is overpriced it is available at 7500 usually.. wait for the right price dont get scammed.. (without card offer)
Positives - ADF and duplex function
Print speed- decent could have been faster if i was printing in draft mode(hp is faster in draft mode otherwise regular speed is same for both)

Wifi - U can print directly from ur android phone even if u dont use any special canon software

If u can get an hp inkjet with wifi and duplex function in the price range go for it otherwise this is the next best thing."

13823,3.0,Compact and handy.
13824,3.0,The product print quality is a bit dull. But very ideal for doing small work. Taking a photostat copy is simple which is quick and better for small purposes.
13825,3.0," I have used Canon Pixma printers for 10+ years. When putting in the ink cartridges, I noticed that the inside did not seem to be pristine.

13826,5.0,"Product wise good.
Have all facilities for personal use.
No issues till now.
However, faced issues while adjusting cartridge's. Manual should have more detail how to fix it.
Was afraid to push it due to fear it might break. Should have a video in which ow much to push to attach the cartridge."
13827,3.0,Ink cartridge very fast over
13828,5.0,"As per price it's worth
Cons: print is slow. It's very noisy. Color photo Print quality is not good.

For basic school and home office work, it's ok."
13829,5.0,"Worth product,usefull, no complication easy to install ,but 1 prob is ink is finishing fastly,i think it can only take 50 color pages maximum,and black and white can take 300 pages,"

13831,4.0,it is good but setup is little complicated
13832,2.0,"I was initially a bit sceptical about this printer on reading the list of features but when I bought this I was super impressed. It’s the only printer with Duplex, ADF and WiFi features under 10k range. The printer is easy to setup and use. I bought this primarily for my family usage for printing school assignments etc and have no complaints. Previously, I used HP printers all the time but this one is simply the best for home usage."
13833,5.0,"It is always showing error 1303 - paper jam when no paper is jammed. Sometimes it works when switch it off and unplug it for few hours it would miraculously start without any error. this error comes when trying to print multiple pages in one print job.

Upon researching this is an issue with most canon printers and people are having lot of issues and support is service motto is no support. It is manufacturing issue and has been for a long time with canon printers.

I would not recommend this product to anyone."
13834,3.0,"Very easy to to use

13837,3.0,Uses very much ink. Cannot use custom size paper.

13839,4.0,"its good printer, wireless, duplex for 20 pages ."
13840,4.0,The print quality is worse then I thought I would be. I know canon printer is Bad but this one is different the print quality is really Bad that i don't even want the printer anymore
13841,5.0,Bluetooth is very much useful for mobile printing. Now a days we can create documents and transfer them. These documents can be printed without a PC. Printing quality is nice. This printer fulfills all my requirements.
13842,4.0,It is the best printer and best features are available.Black print quality is little bit satisfied and colour print very good.
13843,4.0,"It is extremely ease to install. Print quality is good compared to the printers price range. Scanning and copying quality is good.
File size after scan size is not that compact but is manageable (depends on dpi selected).
If you do not have much to print but you need a all in one for scanning, copying and printout, go for it. Extremely good. Till now printed mostly color about 100 pages with average text and color text and few pages with color images. And cartridge shows- Black - 70% remaining and Color - 80% remaining. I think is good. Depend on person to person to see if that is good or bad."
13844,3.0,Printer is working fine and good for the price. You need to compromise on the build quality to get all the functions.
13845,4.0,"Overall I am very pleased with this printer, my first Canon one. Print quality is excellent and print speed is reasonable. I have been able to scan and print on legal size paper also, though this size is not specifically listed in the specs. So far, duplex printing has not worked well. Paper gets jammed at time of turn-around to print the second page. I suspect this is due to the quality of paper available here in India. I have not tried it on a large variety of papers, so I am hoping I will find suitable paper that will allow for duplex printing automatically. Currently, I am manually turning around the paper to print on the reverse side. Hence, I have dropped one star from the overall rating."
13846,4.0,"Good printer for home and students usage, Nice print quality and more printing options like ADF and Auto Duplexing.
Well fit for students usage, not recommended for large numbers of prints bcoz of cartridge model."
13847,4.0,"One has to belong to Ambani family to have this printer. Very high cost of print. Not even 500 prints in one cartridge. Very disappointed.
Only benefit is comfort of printing at home.
But very high cost for some 300 prints for INR 1500 worth cartridge"
13848,5.0,Ofter uesing 1week its show ink very low. I am purchased one new ink cartridge.. i am facing same problem.
13849,5.0,"Good all-in-one features, economical print cost, weighs less than 10kg, fine quality, easy to install/remove cartridges, manually adjustable print intensity, efficient copy options, easy Wi-Fi set up, comfort print from mobile/tablet using App"
13850,5.0, The package looked like a hand me down. If the product functionality is unaffected I will keep it. But this was delivered less than 10 minutes ago and the packaging was appalling to say the least.
13851,5.0,"Purchased a week back.Avarage or above a good product than expected.
Duplex printing is a good feature with this. Scaning is easy, wifi printing setting is quiet difficult. Must see how long the catridges provide ink"
13852,5.0,"The printer every now and then stops printing and pops up with a problem. I have owned this for over 3 years now, but practically I end up having to print from outside shops because when I need the print, it will give some error, which very often has been fixable, but you cannot expect the ease of ""print and pick"" (the convenience for which we buy home printers).
The claim of no.of papers printed (both color and black-white) is far from truth."
13853,5.0,Ink cartridges is not long lasting. Another point cartridges rate is high.better buy other models
13854,5.0,Good
13855,5.0,"I bought this printer because it ""supposedly"" has wifi printing!!!
Surprise, surprise ... just couldn't set up the wifi connectivity.
Firstly, the set up instructions are incomplete and if one goes through the manual, the QR scan takes you to youtube videos which is not helpful at all.
Secondly, during the setup, which I tried with my MacAir, it keep saying that please check the code sent to your machine or mobile to continue. There was none sent to me on my MacAir, none to my email address and none to my mobile ... how could they when I had not even set it up? So... couldn't continue.
Thirdly, I went to the website given in the manual - ij.start.canon ... useless. The model number is not even present.
Fourthly, went to the Canon India website ... again no model. The closest was E4270 while the printer that I purchased was E4200. Downloaded the driver & wifi setup ... went through the procedure ... THOUGH LUCK!!!
Fifthly, wanted to return it ... couldn't; the option for return was not available ... I had to book a ""SERVICE CALL"" for someone to come and set it up for me.

MORE SURPRISE ... the technician called up asking for directions and finally never came. When I called him way past the allotted service time, I was told to send a video of the printer because it was a connectivity issue and the only way to rectify it was to get a replacement for which he needed the video.

I have sent the video and as I waiting, I got a mail saying that your service call has been completed ... please rate the same ...

I am at loss of words.

All that I want now is to return the product and for the seller to return my money!!!!"
13856,5.0,"I went for this printer as one of the reviews that I read was very persuasive. It has been one of the best decisions that I have taken. In typical Amazon fashion, the delivery was smooth and timely. I setup up the printer easily but after a few days noticed that the printer was not responding to print commands. I placed a service request with Epson Service Centre, in less than 24hours, a technician visited my house, installed the appropriate printer driver (I had chosen a broader one) and solved the issue! The print quality is fantastic, whether for home or for small office, this is a very good choice, indeed! Go for it! 👍"
13857,5.0,"I bought this cannon E4570 Printer a few months back as a replacement to my 5 year old HP printer but I regret this decision. This Canon Printer regularly jams when feeding from the tray and rarely works properly on WiFi networks. Print quality is also quite poor in comparison to HP. Ink Cartridges are running out much faster than HP too. Stick with HP or Epson, don't waste your money on new players in the printer market like Canon."

13875,5.0,"Product wise good.
Have all facilities for personal use.
No issues till now.
However, faced issues while adjusting cartridge's. Manual should have more detail how to fix it.
Was afraid to push it due to fear it might break. Should have a video in which ow much to push to attach the cartridge."
13876,3.0,Ink cartridge very fast over
13877,4.0,"As per price it's worth
Cons: print is slow. It's very noisy. Color photo Print quality is not good.

For basic school and home office work, it's ok."
13878,4.0,"Worth product,usefull, no complication easy to install ,but 1 prob is ink is finishing fastly,i think it can only take 50 color pages maximum,and black and white can take 300 pages,"
13879,5.0,Is se scan koi document krke pdf (mobile me save via usb)bana sakte hai
13880,4.0,it is good but setup is little complicated
13881,5.0,"I was initially a bit sceptical about this printer on reading the list of features but when I bought this I was super impressed. It’s the only printer with Duplex, ADF and WiFi features under 10k range. The printer is easy to setup and use. I bought this primarily for my family usage for printing school assignments etc and have no complaints. Previously, I used HP printers all the time but this one is simply the best for home usage."
13882,5.0,"It is always showing error 1303 - paper jam when no paper is jammed. Sometimes it works when switch it off and unplug it for few hours it would miraculously start without any error. this error comes when trying to print multiple pages in one print job.

Upon researching this is an issue with most canon printers and people are having lot of issues and support is service motto is no support. It is manufacturing issue and has been for a long time with canon printers.

I would not recommend this product to anyone."
13883,4.0,"Very easy to to use
The print quality is above average
But colour is little dull
It's kind of annoying that you have to download 2 apps to use it properly"
13884,4.0,User friendly
13885,4.0,"Like : less weight,
Dislike: 1. No backlit LCD. Difficult to read. 2. Not heavy duty. 3. Looks like a toy."
13886,4.0,Uses very much ink. Cannot use custom size paper.
13887,3.0,"Fast print
Fast response
Nice print in colour like photo on photo paper
Easy to install
Dual copy option"
13888,4.0,"its good printer, wireless, duplex for 20 pages ."
13889,4.0,The print quality is worse then I thought I would be. I know canon printer is Bad but this one is different the print quality is really Bad that i don't even want the printer anymore
13890,4.0,Bluetooth is very much useful for mobile printing. Now a days we can create documents and transfer them. These documents can be printed without a PC. Printing quality is nice. This printer fulfills all my requirements.
13891,5.0,It is the best printer and best features are available.Black print quality is little bit satisfied and colour print very good.
13892,4.0,"It is extremely ease to install. Print quality is good compared to the printers price range. Scanning and copying quality is good.
File size after scan size is not that compact but is manageable (depends on dpi selected).
If you do not have much to print but you need a all in one for scanning, copying and printout, go for it. Extremely good. Till now printed mostly color about 100 pages with average text and color text and few pages with color images. And cartridge shows- Black - 70% remaining and Color - 80% remaining. I think is good. Depend on person to person to see if that is good or bad."
13893,4.0,Printer is working fine and good for the price. You need to compromise on the build quality to get all the functions.
13894,3.0,"Overall I am very pleased with this printer, my first Canon one. Print quality is excellent and print speed is reasonable. I have been able to scan and print on legal size paper also, though this size is not specifically listed in the specs. So far, duplex printing has not worked well. Paper gets jammed at time of turn-around to print the second page. I suspect this is due to the quality of paper available here in India. I have not tried it on a large variety of papers, so I am hoping I will find suitable paper that will allow for duplex printing automatically. Currently, I am manually turning around the paper to print on the reverse side. Hence, I have dropped one star from the overall rating."
13895,4.0,"Good printer for home and students usage, Nice print quality and more printing options like ADF and Auto Duplexing.
Well fit for students usage, not recommended for large numbers of prints bcoz of cartridge model."
13896,4.0,"One has to belong to Ambani family to have this printer. Very high cost of print. Not even 500 prints in one cartridge. Very disappointed.
Only benefit is comfort of printing at home.
But very high cost for some 300 prints for INR 1500 worth cartridge"
13897,4.0,Ofter uesing 1week its show ink very low. I am purchased one new ink cartridge.. i am facing same problem.
13898,5.0,"Good all-in-one features, economical print cost, weighs less than 10kg, fine quality, easy to install/remove cartridges, manually adjustable print intensity, efficient copy options, easy Wi-Fi set up, comfort print from mobile/tablet using App"
13899,5.0, The package looked like a hand me down. If the product functionality is unaffected I will keep it. But this was delivered less than 10 minutes ago and the packaging was appalling to say the least.
13900,5.0,"Purchased a week back.Avarage or above a good product than expected.
Duplex printing is a good feature with this. Scaning is easy, wifi printing setting is quiet difficult. Must see how long the catridges provide ink"
13901,5.0,"The printer every now and then stops printing and pops up with a problem. I have owned this for over 3 years now, but practically I end up having to print from outside shops because when I need the print, it will give some error, which very often has been fixable, but you cannot expect the ease of ""print and pick"" (the convenience for which we buy home printers).
The claim of no.of papers printed (both color and black-white) is far from truth."
13902,5.0,Ink cartridges is not long lasting. Another point cartridges rate is high.better buy other models
13903,5.0,Good
13904,5.0,"I bought this printer because it ""supposedly"" has wifi printing!!!
Surprise, surprise ... just couldn't set up the wifi connectivity.
Firstly, the set up instructions are incomplete and if one goes through the manual, the QR scan takes you to youtube videos which is not helpful at all.
Secondly, during the setup, which I tried with my MacAir, it keep saying that please check the code sent to your machine or mobile to continue. There was none sent to me on my MacAir, none to my email address and none to my mobile ... how could they when I had not even set it up? So... couldn't continue.
Thirdly, I went to the website given in the manual - ij.start.canon ... useless. The model number is not even present.
Fourthly, went to the Canon India website ... again no model. The closest was E4270 while the printer that I purchased was E4200. Downloaded the driver & wifi setup ... went through the procedure ... THOUGH LUCK!!!
Fifthly, wanted to return it ... couldn't; the option for return was not available ... I had to book a ""SERVICE CALL"" for someone to come and set it up for me.

MORE SURPRISE ... the technician called up asking for directions and finally never came. When I called him way past the allotted service time, I was told to send a video of the printer because it was a connectivity issue and the only way to rectify it was to get a replacement for which he needed the video.

I have sent the video and as I waiting, I got a mail saying that your service call has been completed ... please rate the same ...

I am at loss of words.

All that I want now is to return the product and for the seller to return my money!!!!"
13905,5.0,"I bought this cannon E4570 Printer a few months back as a replacement to my 5 year old HP printer but I regret this decision. This Canon Printer regularly jams when feeding from the tray and rarely works properly on WiFi networks. Print quality is also quite poor in comparison to HP. Ink Cartridges are running out much faster than HP too. Stick with HP or Epson, don't waste your money on new players in the printer market like Canon."
13906,5.0,Easy to Install - Nice Product - Money Worth
13907,5.0,"This is my first printer at home. I tried printing pages from phone, laptop were the quality of the printing output is excellent which made me to feel better of my first printer purchase through Amazon (as well my first product review in Amazon 😉😉😉 )

Not only printing but scanning of documents works too good 👍 👍 My Overall experience is rated in ⭐️ ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

Thanks to Amazon for displaying the product with correct description and to compare other printers for making decision quick."

13959,5.0,"This printer is amazing. It does high-quality scans, copies documents significantly faster than some of the older devices, and the print quality is impressive.

But.

The cartridge runs out before you even know it. I understand that this is a problem not only with HP printers but most of the printers available in the market, but, HP to follow the same razor and blade module is so not okay.

The cartridge runs out extremely fast, and you have to change it before you have even got a chance to play with your prints. The cartridges are around Rs. 800 each, so I don't think if you print regularly, this is the right one for you. But if you are like me, who only uses the printer for home purposes, then yeah, go for it. This printer is amazing and does what you need it to do.

All in all, the decision is up to you. The cartridge runs out fast, but the printer is super convenient, and the prints it gives are of high quality.

Cheerio,

14009,5.0,print quality is good but if you are searching of a printer for office use it not made for you because it has too much ink cunsuption i suggest you to buy a printer with inktank you may need to buy some expensive but you will worth of it
14010,4.0,"This printer is amazing. It does high-quality scans, copies documents significantly faster than some of the older devices, and the print quality is impressive.

But.

The cartridge runs out before you even know it. I understand that this is a problem not only with HP printers but most of the printers available in the market, but, HP to follow the same razor and blade module is so not okay.

The cartridge runs out extremely fast, and you have to change it before you have even got a chance to play with your prints. The cartridges are around Rs. 800 each, so I don't think if you print regularly, this is the right one for you. But if you are like me, who only uses the printer for home purposes, then yeah, go for it. This printer is amazing and does what you need it to do.

All in all, the decision is up to you. The cartridge runs out fast, but the printer is super convenient, and the prints it gives are of high quality.

Cheerio,

14014,5.0,Got delivered today and I set up using the cable and fired few prints.. Print quality is good. Need to see how long the catridge lasts..but for home purpose and medium usage I think it works

14020,3.0,Didn't expect...need replacement
14021,4.0,Good infra to have it at home for basic printing and scanning requirements.
14022,5.0,Printing cost is approx Rs. 7 to Rs. 10 per page which is very high. Colour cartridge and Black Cartridge Ink hardly last for 70 to 100 pages

14024,2.0,Good to handle. Refill are quite expensive. Very delicate machine.
14025,5.0,Very good 🙂 happy
14026,3.0,"The printer seems to be a good, inexpensive printer that is easy to operate. My only issue is that the color cartridge literally lasted for one page only, and even then the page only had a small amount of color. I understand that the starter cartridges are not normal cartridge capacity, but I certainly expected it to last longer than one page. Without the option to print black and white only, I now have a printer I cannot use until I can get a new color cartridge. If this is the norm, I would highly recommend buying additional cartridges immediately. I wouldn't even bother installing the cartridge that comes with it."

14031,1.0,"WORST, WORST, WORST PRINTER AND COMPANY. I am a person who has never spent so much time on writing a review. But I am forced to. The worst printer and the worst support I have ever received. Everyday I am spending so much time to resolve one or the other issue. Now I feel the only thing HP wants is all my personal details during set up, no help after that. It has given me problems only from the first day. It took so much time to install. Once installed, when I started taking print, the paper will reach halfway to the cartridge and then will show stuck. Everytime I have to turn off the printer and restart it to print the page. I need to repeat it after every sheet. It was resolved accidentally when my paper sheet was over and I purchased the best GSM paper from the market. Till that time, I did not receive any solution from Hp or from any other source. After that, when I was taking a print urgently, the margins of the printer never come properly as shown in the softcopy of the PDF. I took so many prints after changing the paper option to A4, letter and legal. Same results. Only after I changed the position of the paper and put it to one side of the tray, did the print come properly. First time I am encountering a printer, for which you can put paper in different positions in the tray for the print to come properly. Usually you put the paper in the up or down tray and the print comes properly. Now I am using another wifi, not the previous one. You can scan by connecting the USB cable, but it never prints. I checked multiple sites including HP help to change my wifi. I tried multiple suggestions given, but none works out. Also, I purchased a new black cartridge from Amazon online and connected it properly, but the cartridge status shows a red light. Dont know why. I have used printers in India and abroad, both laser and inkjet. HP printers were always notorious for installation, but never gave me this much trouble. Brother laser printers were always my best bet. But, since I needed this printer only for a short time, I purchased the less costly printer."

All in one includes print, scan, copy and fax as well, Colour, adf, duplex printing, wifi. You download the app in ur phone and give print commands via mobile itself. Only two issue that I faced, firstly the print quality(which I'll speak to the service center) and secondly is the total quantity of color prints. I have only taken out couple of color printouts bad already the level of ink is 90%. I guess I'll have to purchase a larger cartridge."
14108,4.0,"I bought this item in August 2022, and the delivery and packaging was as good and sturdy as I've come to expect from Amazon. Using the printer from my Macbook is a breeze over wifi, although printing over wifi from Android requires some poorly designed app from Canon and has no direct support.

The only couple of issues I faced with this printer were during setup.
1. Scanning the qr code for the setup guide didn't actually lead to much of a guide, rather a boilerplate page. I would only much later find out the way from that page to the actual guide. Canon could do a better job of surfacing the online guide, as the image clarity in the included hard copy is quite poor.
2. Installation of cartridges seemed to take forever - I must have removed and re-inserted them almost 5 times before they were properly detected. No error messages showed up, and I didn't know if I had recieved a faulty product, or if I was doing something wrong.
3. Never having owned a printer, and always using either copy shops or the huge laser printers at work, I ended up making a mistake in setting up the paper tray, leading to a jam at the first print itself. Thankfully it was straightforward to open up the printer from the back side and remove the torn pieces. Canon could do a better job of demonstrating how to set up the paper sheets - clearer access to the online guide might've helped here.

Except for the these minor concerns in setup, I'm enjoying using this printer surprisingly, since printers (alongside projectors ) are usually the worst items ever developed by the electronics industry. I've used all the features so far - print ( colored, double sided), scan and copy and not faced any issues with quality, wifi or the cartridges.

< Information on the number of color and black-and-white sheets from the initial set of cartridges to be added when I run out>"
14109,4.0,Add Light in LED Display for use in lightless area..
14110,3.0,"Cannon E4570.
This was launched as a successor for E4270 (I searched everywhere but couldn't find a credible source to explain the differences between the two). I researched extensively before purchase to find a printer which will fullfil the following criteria for me - wifi enabled (so that we can print with smartphone without opening the laptop), clear color print (decent for child's homework, photo quality not required) and cheap to run. E4270 seem to fit all the criteria, so I ordered this. Even the canon authorised showroom didn't have E4570 in stock, so ordered the E4570 off Amazon.
Summary - fullfills top two criteria. Though is a little expensive if you do more than the occasional print.

Delivery was 3 days earlier than the delivery date shown on Amazon, so that was great. It was just the printer box, with no outer packing. The box was sealed with cello tape, and not sealed, so I suspect it had been opened at some point. Thankfully, all the components were there, and the seal on the printer and cartridges were intact, so i was ok with the delivery.

Setup was smooth on both my smartphone and laptop over wifi. I never had to use the usb cable. Setup was through the canon app on phone and the canon website (link for both given in manual), which guides step by step on how to setup. I did not face any challenges and the setup and printing has been smooth from all devices.

Color prints are a bit faded on plain paper (75gsm). This might be a function of the paper and not the printer. The black&white prints are crisp and sharp. The print speed is decent.

The only negative is the amount of ink consumption. While the box says 180 color prints and 300 b&w, both my cartridges are showing at 80% after 4 color print and around 30 b&w. Specially for color prints, the printer tends to drop the cartridge level by a notch after just 2-3 prints. I suspect the color cartridge will not last longer that 30-40 full color pages. Refilling the cartridges a few times is of course an option, but it is messy and requires practice. This is fine for me as I need color prints very rarely.

A special mention for the ADF and duplex printing. Both the features are extremely useful. Duplex printing is especially unique in this price range, and comes in very handy while printing larger documents.

Overall, I am happy with my purchase after couple of weeks of usage. I will update the review if I run into any issues."
14111,4.0,Everything is good but just print approx 250 pages and cartridge ink goes down

14114,4.0,Too slow printing. Always paper jammed if u put bulk paper on tray. Only single paper print good... which is very headache
14115,3.0,"Good printer but
-Even if u print in monochrome it uses colour ink.. meaning even if u print in b&w it still uses a little colour ink
- U can't print if one of the ink is empty both have to installed and full( in my hp inkjet printer It prints even if i remove coloured cartridge)
-bought the one with smart speaker for 8300 which is overpriced it is available at 7500 usually.. wait for the right price dont get scammed.. (without card offer)
Positives - ADF and duplex function
Print speed- decent could have been faster if i was printing in draft mode(hp is faster in draft mode otherwise regular speed is same for both)

Wifi - U can print directly from ur android phone even if u dont use any special canon software

If u can get an hp inkjet with wifi and duplex function in the price range go for it otherwise this is the next best thing."

I could be wrong but the wobbly ink compartment leads me to believe it was probably a returned item (unlikely to be a manufacturing defect). The photo print quality is passable for small images in documents, b&w is adequate. Installation was straightforward, configuration on IoS & Android phones and laptops was great. Once running, Canon Pixma printers can provide years of trouble free service."

14151,3.0,"I bought this printer because it ""supposedly"" has wifi printing!!!
Surprise, surprise ... just couldn't set up the wifi connectivity.
Firstly, the set up instructions are incomplete and if one goes through the manual, the QR scan takes you to youtube videos which is not helpful at all.
Secondly, during the setup, which I tried with my MacAir, it keep saying that please check the code sent to your machine or mobile to continue. There was none sent to me on my MacAir, none to my email address and none to my mobile ... how could they when I had not even set it up? So... couldn't continue.
Thirdly, I went to the website given in the manual - ij.start.canon ... useless. The model number is not even present.
Fourthly, went to the Canon India website ... again no model. The closest was E4270 while the printer that I purchased was E4200. Downloaded the driver & wifi setup ... went through the procedure ... THOUGH LUCK!!!
Fifthly, wanted to return it ... couldn't; the option for return was not available ... I had to book a ""SERVICE CALL"" for someone to come and set it up for me.

MORE SURPRISE ... the technician called up asking for directions and finally never came. When I called him way past the allotted service time, I was told to send a video of the printer because it was a connectivity issue and the only way to rectify it was to get a replacement for which he needed the video.

I have sent the video and as I waiting, I got a mail saying that your service call has been completed ... please rate the same ...

I am at loss of words.

All that I want now is to return the product and for the seller to return my money!!!!"
14152,4.0,"I went for this printer as one of the reviews that I read was very persuasive. It has been one of the best decisions that I have taken. In typical Amazon fashion, the delivery was smooth and timely. I setup up the printer easily but after a few days noticed that the printer was not responding to print commands. I placed a service request with Epson Service Centre, in less than 24hours, a technician visited my house, installed the appropriate printer driver (I had chosen a broader one) and solved the issue! The print quality is fantastic, whether for home or for small office, this is a very good choice, indeed! Go for it! 👍"
14153,5.0,"I bought this cannon E4570 Printer a few months back as a replacement to my 5 year old HP printer but I regret this decision. This Canon Printer regularly jams when feeding from the tray and rarely works properly on WiFi networks. Print quality is also quite poor in comparison to HP. Ink Cartridges are running out much faster than HP too. Stick with HP or Epson, don't waste your money on new players in the printer market like Canon."

Thanks to Amazon for displaying the product with correct description and to compare other printers for making decision quick."
14156,1.0,"If you are purchasing it for your home use, don't look any further. It has got all the functions you'll find in a 20-30k worth printers. All in one includes print, scan, copy and fax as well, Colour, adf, duplex printing, wifi. You download the app in ur phone and give print commands via mobile itself. Only two issue that I faced, firstly the print quality(which I'll speak to the service center) and secondly is the total quantity of color prints. I have only taken out couple of color printouts bad already the level of ink is 90%. I guess I'll have to purchase a larger cartridge."
14157,5.0,"I bought this item in August 2022, and the delivery and packaging was as good and sturdy as I've come to expect from Amazon. Using the printer from my Macbook is a breeze over wifi, although printing over wifi from Android requires some poorly designed app from Canon and has no direct support.

The only couple of issues I faced with this printer were during setup.
1. Scanning the qr code for the setup guide didn't actually lead to much of a guide, rather a boilerplate page. I would only much later find out the way from that page to the actual guide. Canon could do a better job of surfacing the online guide, as the image clarity in the included hard copy is quite poor.
2. Installation of cartridges seemed to take forever - I must have removed and re-inserted them almost 5 times before they were properly detected. No error messages showed up, and I didn't know if I had recieved a faulty product, or if I was doing something wrong.
3. Never having owned a printer, and always using either copy shops or the huge laser printers at work, I ended up making a mistake in setting up the paper tray, leading to a jam at the first print itself. Thankfully it was straightforward to open up the printer from the back side and remove the torn pieces. Canon could do a better job of demonstrating how to set up the paper sheets - clearer access to the online guide might've helped here.

Except for the these minor concerns in setup, I'm enjoying using this printer surprisingly, since printers (alongside projectors ) are usually the worst items ever developed by the electronics industry. I've used all the features so far - print ( colored, double sided), scan and copy and not faced any issues with quality, wifi or the cartridges.

14159,5.0,"Cannon E4570.
This was launched as a successor for E4270 (I searched everywhere but couldn't find a credible source to explain the differences between the two). I researched extensively before purchase to find a printer which will fullfil the following criteria for me - wifi enabled (so that we can print with smartphone without opening the laptop), clear color print (decent for child's homework, photo quality not required) and cheap to run. E4270 seem to fit all the criteria, so I ordered this. Even the canon authorised showroom didn't have E4570 in stock, so ordered the E4570 off Amazon.
Summary - fullfills top two criteria. Though is a little expensive if you do more than the occasional print.

Delivery was 3 days earlier than the delivery date shown on Amazon, so that was great. It was just the printer box, with no outer packing. The box was sealed with cello tape, and not sealed, so I suspect it had been opened at some point. Thankfully, all the components were there, and the seal on the printer and cartridges were intact, so i was ok with the delivery.

Setup was smooth on both my smartphone and laptop over wifi. I never had to use the usb cable. Setup was through the canon app on phone and the canon website (link for both given in manual), which guides step by step on how to setup. I did not face any challenges and the setup and printing has been smooth from all devices.

Color prints are a bit faded on plain paper (75gsm). This might be a function of the paper and not the printer. The black&white prints are crisp and sharp. The print speed is decent.

The only negative is the amount of ink consumption. While the box says 180 color prints and 300 b&w, both my cartridges are showing at 80% after 4 color print and around 30 b&w. Specially for color prints, the printer tends to drop the cartridge level by a notch after just 2-3 prints. I suspect the color cartridge will not last longer that 30-40 full color pages. Refilling the cartridges a few times is of course an option, but it is messy and requires practice. This is fine for me as I need color prints very rarely.

A special mention for the ADF and duplex printing. Both the features are extremely useful. Duplex printing is especially unique in this price range, and comes in very handy while printing larger documents.

Overall, I am happy with my purchase after couple of weeks of usage. I will update the review if I run into any issues."
14160,3.0,Everything is good but just print approx 250 pages and cartridge ink goes down
14161,5.0,After 20days of usage ..I'm unable to print as it is showing black ink running low ..i have print only 100pages ...and in description they told that 400pages yield thats totally wrong
14162,2.0,Need to lower the exposure for every scanned image.
14163,3.0,Too slow printing. Always paper jammed if u put bulk paper on tray. Only single paper print good... which is very headache
14164,4.0,"Good printer but
-Even if u print in monochrome it uses colour ink.. meaning even if u print in b&w it still uses a little colour ink
- U can't print if one of the ink is empty both have to installed and full( in my hp inkjet printer It prints even if i remove coloured cartridge)
-bought the one with smart speaker for 8300 which is overpriced it is available at 7500 usually.. wait for the right price dont get scammed.. (without card offer)
Positives - ADF and duplex function
Print speed- decent could have been faster if i was printing in draft mode(hp is faster in draft mode otherwise regular speed is same for both)

Wifi - U can print directly from ur android phone even if u dont use any special canon software

If u can get an hp inkjet with wifi and duplex function in the price range go for it otherwise this is the next best thing."

I could be wrong but the wobbly ink compartment leads me to believe it was probably a returned item (unlikely to be a manufacturing defect). The photo print quality is passable for small images in documents, b&w is adequate. Installation was straightforward, configuration on IoS & Android phones and laptops was great. Once running, Canon Pixma printers can provide years of trouble free service."

14204,4.0,very good product and very easy to use
14205,2.0,Well it compete with top brands of Epson & HP products.
14206,1.0,"After having frustrating experience with HP printer with its expensive cost of printing (70Rs/ print) we have chosen Canon G3000 printer after carefully reviewing the feedback on choices we have i.e. Brother, Epson and Canon; however disappointed with the performance. Whatever the product is i must accept it, this is only to share my views and not in any negative sense.

Starting with Pros:
- Printer comes with plenty of Ink and that will probably provide ROI with in 2 years considering cost of printing with HP.
- Tech support is too fast, they sent an engineer within 2 hours placing request.

What is not working:
- This is not a simple plug-n-play printer, the behavior of the printer requires good knowledge of how this works. For e.g. you have to leave the printer on for 5 minutes before you start printing. My exp previous printer is almost flawless and smooth.
- Print quality is pale, dull. What you see on screen is not what you get; this conclusion is after comparing printouts taken from earlier printer. However a good point is that the text is sharp.
- Software is difficult to trace, operate and use. Not sure why the software is provided in first place when you can directly fire printout without installing this software.
- Very difficult to understand error codes. The power on light is blinking indicating that there is no paper, however the problem is some thing else.

The above issues i have mentioned are some thing you cant understand/ check when you purchase online."
14207,5.0,"1. Time to get print,
Black and white - 5-6 seconds
Colour- 25-30 seconds
2. You have to take atleast 1 colour copy daily and also do ''Cleaning'' once in 2 days (using Maintenance tab in printer properties). Otherwise, you may have to do Deep cleaning or system cleaning which may consume half of your ink..
3. It will shows errors at the time of paper jam or no ink etc. Some errors would not be solved even after printer off and on. For every error there are certain techniques for solution using Power, Stop and Color buttons. You can search in YouTube for such solutions. No need to call technical team.
4. The printer is noisy..
6. No. of pages per refill depends on how we use the printer.. I think I get approx,
Black and white- 2000-3000
Colour- 2000-3000
Pls note, for Black & White we need only one ink bottle. For colour, we need 3 ink bottles

I refused to pay till The printer is in proper order. The technitian left saying that his boss would call. His boss called and his attitude was very careless and unproffessional. I had to shout back at him. He said I have to change the heads if I want a good print and he also said 'are you printing xerox copies ? For your home yoy dont need good quality."" I got angry and asked him why I was not informed before I objected about poor print quality. The so called Boss was very rude and used abusive foul dreregotery language.

14214,4.0,Very easy to install
14215,2.0,"Got it for less than 10k in 2019. Primarily for the kids usage and occasional copying of documents and scanning for my usage. The idea was the ink tank is cheaper than cartridge overall. Except for a couple of occassions when left unused for too long(used full head clean to get it to work properly), this works satisfactorily and serves the purpose. Inkjet speed is slower, so it takes a moment to print even when copying, but the delay isn't noticeable since usage at home doesn't involve long queues. I use wifi primarily and it's a bit of a chore when you change your wifi - else it's simple enough to use. Scanner is great and configurable for different speeds and dpi.

I tested this to print on photo paper which was as good as photos professionally printed. Since this is jet, if there is problem with any color it generally gives out Grey's on regular paper. I printed about 1.5 reams of A4, with around quarter of Inks still available. Rough math about 3 rupee per page including colors.

The software for printing is not the simplest, but for a regular user it won't be rocket science either. Overall since it's an inkjet primarily for home use, it's not a bad deal or bad product.

Can be better but given a choice i will happily buy it again since it's the cheapest and best value for money in the branded inkjet printers."

14225,3.0,"I have a router in 1st floor and 3 more at ground floor — all under one SSID.

The installation instructions suggested not to connect the printer with a computer. But in auto search mode, the WIFI detection failed repeatedly, even after following all instructions.

Finall the instruction was to connect the printer to a computer and then initiate the search. With this the printer succeeded instantly after asking for password.

My point is that I wasted almost 3 hours trying to setup WIFI without connecting to a PC. Is it not better to set up the printer by connecting it to a computer right at the beginning?

Apart from this issue, the printer is excellent."
14226,3.0,Good product i am very happy. 👍
14227,4.0,"I ordered this printer yesterday i.e. on 24-5-2022 and recieved the delivery on the next day.
However, when i recived the printer it was not packed in default Amazon packing, there was just a black seal around the box with Amazon logo. This was quite awkward and doubt full for me. Now let's talk about the printer- ink filling is very easy there is no way you end up filling the wrong color in wrong tank ( unless if you are color blind ) same goes for print head installation. Before installation of drivers and softwares on pc make sure you are done with initialization of the printer, following the manual. Other wise you will experience errors especially on wifi installation..
Unfortunately for me in my first print during printing the alignment through the installation setup my sheet ( A4 ) got stucked and i had hard time fixing it, ( i had to remove print heads to removed the torned stucked piece of paper beneath them) but it was solved later. after re-trying printing went well. I have no idea why it happened at first. The last concerning thing i found is the indicator light, i had accidentally touched one and they ""move"" along with others. So i can say built quality is fair, a delicate thing.
Overall the printer is good. I will update more later."
14228,2.0,Very good printer with wifi feature
14229,5.0,"Its an initial review. SO after using it for 10-15 times, i must say it delivered great quality color photos on glossy paper. I used 4×6 & A4 glossy photo paper. Got 2 extra refills of black color. And the consumption of ink is quite efficient. Speed is good enough for me at office as well as at home. So no complaints yet. Will update review after using for 3-4 months."
14230,5.0,Color printing is not effective. red shade colors are not working
14231,4.0,"I bought the product at a steal value, which is good.

Although I was aware that there is no LCD screen to guide me thorough the menus, my geekiness will support me, I was sure.

Installation with my computer via WiFi router was pretty easy. Did a few tries to locate the printer on my network and tried the button shortcuts and finally got it connected.

Prints were good. Ink seems to be drained a lot as 3 prints on, I could see about 15 percent drop in the ink levels. Need to ascertain it in the long duration.

Now comes the tricky part. I wanted to connect it to my phone and another phone not on my WiFi router network. I installed the Canon ""Print"" app and it was not detecting my printer.

I tried detecting WiFi direct devices but was not able to see the printer. After a few tries with the button shortcuts, I was able to locate it in the regular WiFi devices. I connected to the WiFi printer and was able to at least connect the phone to the printer directly. Prints and scans were again possible.

Then came the real headache. The printer was not getting detected by the computer now. By some unknown reasons, this printer is not able to connect to both services, WiFi direct (act as hotspot) and regular WiFi (access a hotspot) simultaneously.

My previous WiFi MFD, a 5000 rupee HP was easier to install, easier to understand and connect and had none of the aforementioned WiFi issues!

I called up the Canon customer care (18002083366) on Saturday and raised a service request. service guy will visit my in 24 hours, I was told. Come Tuesday, I still didn't get the service call atleast.

I gave them a call on Tuesday morning and reiterated the issue. They gave me a local service number. After a few hours, I got a call and I had to tell them the whole story again. Second installation is not free, I was told. I said that the first installation was done by myself. They agreed to come by evening.

Evening they gave excuses that they were caught up with other customers and don't even have the courtesy to lift my phone. I'm still waiting. Will update after they actual arrive. I just hope the service rep has better skills than myself.

I'm pretty sure it's not an issue which can be sorted out onsite. There might be shop servicing needed. I should have gone with Amazon return as I'm still within that period. But I'm being a gentleman, for now.

Update : Gentleman's patience broke. I got a replacement. Problem persists another way.
I realised my 12k Canon printer can only act as either a wifi-direct printer or can access an external WiFi router, but cannot do both, like my 5k HP printer.
The technicians reply made it clear. Sir, canon doesn't have any models in the sub-15k range which can be accessed by laptops vide wifi router and at the same time by accessed by phones vide wifi Direct! Thumbs down.

The printer however served its purpose of printing well in standard and best modes. Draft mode had lines showing up on an otherwise splendid photo.

Another irritating problem with this device is the scanning application. Competitors need to learn from HP. Their scanning apps were so user friendly. This one in yet to find easy ways to scan proud or documents readily with my required settings by default. Not at all user friendly. Instead it pops up like some irritating ads we get online!

Overall, this is an ok device for the rate. The only saving grace are the ciss, which for now works great and the decent print quality for standard and best modes. So far so good."
14232,3.0,Wifi not working but still print good
14233,1.0,"Yes off course I like this printer 🖨️
It's good for students. But when we take colour prints in glossy paper it quality is some what poor. But b and wht it is best, easy to connect to phone, Xerox is good, scan works better than i expected, good for this budget. Go for it no other confution"
14234,2.0,It's been quite a few years and running good. You have to run this printer otherwise it will get dry. The Technician assembled my printer is very helpful whenever I call him he help me. So I would say service is best. Even after warranty.
14235,1.0,"Best Product by cannon in this price range.very good printing , photocopy"
14236,4.0,"I am writing this review on this printer after using it for over a year. In this year, I printed about 2000+ pages both color and black&white. So my review is based on observations on them.

=== Print Quality ===
This is definitely the brightest point with this printer. I used Epson ink tank printer earlier and were not satisfied with the results of it. But this Canon printer makes the cut. I am amazed to see the results of the printing both color and B&W. I printed many photos on photo papers and the results were better than the inkjet printers.

=== Ink Longevity ===
This is another biggest selling point of this printer. The printer came with 4 ink bottles - Black, Cyan, Magenta, Yellow. After printing over 2000 pages so far (photos and documents) I still see 50% of the ink left.

=== Ease of Use ===
I can connect this to my wifi router and get started in 5 minutes. All I need is to read the instructions carefully. And voila, all my devices - Computer, Laptop, Mobile and iPad - can print without any hassles. They can detect the printer and starts printing just in minute.

=== Paper Feeding ===
In my more than one year experience with this printer, I never faced a single paper jam. If at all something happens, check paper feeder if any small objects stuck accidentally.

=== Scanner ===
Not used much but overall quality was ok. If you want crystal clear scans, this is not for you.

=== Copier ===
Its just a click of button. Keep your document inside the scanner and click on blabk or color button. Your document copy is ready.

=== Issues ===
So far I came across only one issue. The printer orange light starts blinking and the messages shows that the ink cleaner bed was overflown and needs a service. But I followed the instructions on Youtube videos, cleaned the ink cleaning bed and cartridges for 4 to 5 times and then the printer came back to normal. But this took over 4 hours to understand and solve the issue.

=== Advice ===
1. Do not perform system cleaning too many times. This will cause overflowing of tank on ink cleaner bed and malfunction your primter.
2. Do not use cheap paper, use paper such as JK Sparkle etc.
3. Do not print photo prints on normal paper, use photo paper or thick paper.
4. Make sure to print few papers at least once a week with all colors. This will reduce color logging inside the tubes.

Overall, I am very satisfied with this printer and the quality of prints it gives you.

Update 11/11/19
I faced one more issue after long time. The printer unable to feed the paper and I couldn't find any object inside the feed. After two days of struggling I came up with an idea of reverse feeding the paper from inside the printer, i.e. open the top box to see printer inside and switch off and onthe printer. While stopping, it reverses spinning wheel and load paper manually to it just in time. Voila, it started."
14237,4.0,This printer prints well connects with my machine without any issue

14243,3.0,I used to use earlier however deskjet printer. It was utter waste as cost per print exorbitantly high. Went for this Canon inkjet printer. Printed 100 plus sheets. Still the ink remains at same level.
14244,4.0,"Bought this product at 14k approx, for installation I had to follow a few Youtube videos.
The printer makes Noise while printing, Not as smooth as i expected, The print is good Not that fine as expected from Cannon.
Overall considerable product."

14246,4.0,"Lines show on glosy paper 180 gsm while printing colour photo
Its my first printer so not so much experience but yes it’s easy to install and easy to use"
14247,4.0,"The print quality is excellent. Printing speed is great for black. For colour, it is reasonably okay. Two side printing would have helped a lot.

It was easy to install. YouTube videos helped. Tech support was not required.

The only complaint I have is that the yellow ink level automatically went down fast, though it was initially equal to the cyan and magenta ink levels.

Wifi connectivity helps a lot in printing. One PDF got printed via desktop correctly, but got blank pages via the Canon Print Inkjet app on mobile.

Overall, it is a great buy."
14248,4.0,Printing is very slow 🦥🦥 with a loud sound
14249,4.0,"Chose canon over others due to its mega reputation and Classy size & shape.Its all-in-one ability supersedes all contemporary brands.

Here are my few observations of the product :

1.) Its an ink tank printer that comes with separate ink tanks to be filled with ink red , yellow , blue & black .Its always considered to be more economical for per page printing and should be chosen if you have bulk work on a routine basis.

In these ink tank printers, it is also required to take prints on a minimum weekly basis or prolonged non-usage may lead to drying of heads .

2.) The construction of the printer is very elegant and solid and the ink tanks are absorbed in the regular chassis of the printer unlike HP brand, however it is my personal preference.

Solid doesn't mean you can afford to drop it , it means the plastic used for construction feels very premium and rigid.

3.) Regarding functionality - It can scan and print documents very fast .Page size supported is from 4.0""x 6.0"" photo paper to A4 ,Letter ,Legal , A5 , B5 .

I purchased glossy kodak photo papers 280 GSM & paperone A4 100 GSM papers and the print quality was excellent.

For pictures , it takes few minutes but its worth the wait .If you choose the right paper the photos are bound to be very good ,However at few places i found the shade of green slightly dark in print than in actual photo that was scanned.

Resolution is good for both photos and documents.

Printing makes slight noise but is tolerable , its not like neighbour or even other room person will be disturbed.

4.) Got it with additional warranty for onsite repair for next 2 years.

5.) I bought it first then realized i don't have that much work to use it on daily basis so i would ask my readers to buy only if you have routine works or make use of shops."
14250,4.0,Connecting the printer to your Wi-Fi for Air print is little hectic as you need to follow the documentation from canon website. Other wise everything was smooth.
14251,5.0,Teeth lining on glossy paper prining
14252,3.0,Good
14253,4.0,Thanks
14254,5.0,Well it compete with top brands of Epson & HP products.
14255,5.0,"After having frustrating experience with HP printer with its expensive cost of printing (70Rs/ print) we have chosen Canon G3000 printer after carefully reviewing the feedback on choices we have i.e. Brother, Epson and Canon; however disappointed with the performance. Whatever the product is i must accept it, this is only to share my views and not in any negative sense.

Starting with Pros:
- Printer comes with plenty of Ink and that will probably provide ROI with in 2 years considering cost of printing with HP.
- Tech support is too fast, they sent an engineer within 2 hours placing request.

What is not working:
- This is not a simple plug-n-play printer, the behavior of the printer requires good knowledge of how this works. For e.g. you have to leave the printer on for 5 minutes before you start printing. My exp previous printer is almost flawless and smooth.
- Print quality is pale, dull. What you see on screen is not what you get; this conclusion is after comparing printouts taken from earlier printer. However a good point is that the text is sharp.
- Software is difficult to trace, operate and use. Not sure why the software is provided in first place when you can directly fire printout without installing this software.
- Very difficult to understand error codes. The power on light is blinking indicating that there is no paper, however the problem is some thing else.

The above issues i have mentioned are some thing you cant understand/ check when you purchase online."
14256,5.0,"1. Time to get print,
Black and white - 5-6 seconds
Colour- 25-30 seconds
2. You have to take atleast 1 colour copy daily and also do ''Cleaning'' once in 2 days (using Maintenance tab in printer properties). Otherwise, you may have to do Deep cleaning or system cleaning which may consume half of your ink..
3. It will shows errors at the time of paper jam or no ink etc. Some errors would not be solved even after printer off and on. For every error there are certain techniques for solution using Power, Stop and Color buttons. You can search in YouTube for such solutions. No need to call technical team.
4. The printer is noisy..
6. No. of pages per refill depends on how we use the printer.. I think I get approx,
Black and white- 2000-3000
Colour- 2000-3000
Pls note, for Black & White we need only one ink bottle. For colour, we need 3 ink bottles
5. I bought it before 3 years. No complaint till now.
Before you buy the printer, please ensure the availability of Original canon ink and its price.."
14257,5.0,"I'm just unboxing 30 sep 22 06:15pm. There is no damages in this delivery and same model received, I'm happy. This product full functionality will chucking in three months after given my review."

14259,5.0,"I have bee using Canon PixmaG 300 since few years. Recently I had a problem as the printer colour output was showing only one colour I called the customer care. A technitian came and took the printer. He brought back the printer the next day. But the quality of printing was bad as the colours were not perfect but hazy. I refused to pay till The printer is in proper order. The technitian left saying that his boss would call. His boss called and his attitude was very careless and unproffessional. I had to shout back at him. He said I have to change the heads if I want a good print and he also said 'are you printing xerox copies ? For your home yoy dont need good quality."" I got angry and asked him why I was not informed before I objected about poor print quality. The so called Boss was very rude and used abusive foul dreregotery language. This is how Canon customer care treats customers."
14260,4.0,Plastic Quality is not that good
14261,3.0,Nice product..easy installation
14262,3.0,"Once warranty is over if u call support team it will be picked by non techie who don't even know Abcd of printer whether problem is small or big they can only arrange a person visit @ visiting charge of 640. Unfair, didn't expect from canon that no call support for basic trouble shooting. I advice u guys to choose some other brand who is ready to basic trouble shooting through call instead of waiting to charge on us"
14263,4.0,Very easy to install
14264,5.0,"Got it for less than 10k in 2019. Primarily for the kids usage and occasional copying of documents and scanning for my usage. The idea was the ink tank is cheaper than cartridge overall. Except for a couple of occassions when left unused for too long(used full head clean to get it to work properly), this works satisfactorily and serves the purpose. Inkjet speed is slower, so it takes a moment to print even when copying, but the delay isn't noticeable since usage at home doesn't involve long queues. I use wifi primarily and it's a bit of a chore when you change your wifi - else it's simple enough to use. Scanner is great and configurable for different speeds and dpi.

I tested this to print on photo paper which was as good as photos professionally printed. Since this is jet, if there is problem with any color it generally gives out Grey's on regular paper. I printed about 1.5 reams of A4, with around quarter of Inks still available. Rough math about 3 rupee per page including colors.

The software for printing is not the simplest, but for a regular user it won't be rocket science either. Overall since it's an inkjet primarily for home use, it's not a bad deal or bad product.

Can be better but given a choice i will happily buy it again since it's the cheapest and best value for money in the branded inkjet printers."

14296,4.0,"The print quality is excellent. Printing speed is great for black. For colour, it is reasonably okay. Two side printing would have helped a lot.

It was easy to install. YouTube videos helped. Tech support was not required.

The only complaint I have is that the yellow ink level automatically went down fast, though it was initially equal to the cyan and magenta ink levels.

Wifi connectivity helps a lot in printing. One PDF got printed via desktop correctly, but got blank pages via the Canon Print Inkjet app on mobile.

Overall, it is a great buy."
14297,4.0,Printing is very slow 🦥🦥 with a loud sound
14298,4.0,"Chose canon over others due to its mega reputation and Classy size & shape.Its all-in-one ability supersedes all contemporary brands.

Here are my few observations of the product :

1.) Its an ink tank printer that comes with separate ink tanks to be filled with ink red , yellow , blue & black .Its always considered to be more economical for per page printing and should be chosen if you have bulk work on a routine basis.

In these ink tank printers, it is also required to take prints on a minimum weekly basis or prolonged non-usage may lead to drying of heads .

2.) The construction of the printer is very elegant and solid and the ink tanks are absorbed in the regular chassis of the printer unlike HP brand, however it is my personal preference.

Solid doesn't mean you can afford to drop it , it means the plastic used for construction feels very premium and rigid.

3.) Regarding functionality - It can scan and print documents very fast .Page size supported is from 4.0""x 6.0"" photo paper to A4 ,Letter ,Legal , A5 , B5 .

I purchased glossy kodak photo papers 280 GSM & paperone A4 100 GSM papers and the print quality was excellent.

For pictures , it takes few minutes but its worth the wait .If you choose the right paper the photos are bound to be very good ,However at few places i found the shade of green slightly dark in print than in actual photo that was scanned.

Resolution is good for both photos and documents.

Printing makes slight noise but is tolerable , its not like neighbour or even other room person will be disturbed.

4.) Got it with additional warranty for onsite repair for next 2 years.

5.) I bought it first then realized i don't have that much work to use it on daily basis so i would ask my readers to buy only if you have routine works or make use of shops."
14299,4.0,Connecting the printer to your Wi-Fi for Air print is little hectic as you need to follow the documentation from canon website. Other wise everything was smooth.

I called HP support again and was told they cannot do anything if the service centre is not responding.

The hilarious part is that HP sent me survey link for the service request which was never solved. I wrote back asking them to look into the callousness of their service centre. But no action from HP again!

14403,5.0,"20 years ago I bought a Brother that had issue connecting to the Wifi. Online troubleshooting say to check the router, windows corrupt file etc. The only way to fix it and make it connect to the wifi was to add a space at the end of the network key when using the printer menu to setup the wifi. Now this printer has the same issue. Can't believe Brother still hasn't fixed this. Ridiculous. If you are using the WLAN Setup Wizard thru the printer, enter your network ket and using the symbol list add a ""space"" at the end (there is a ""space"" available in the list). Don't use ""_"" (underscore)."
14404,5.0,"This is an amazing all in one printing-scanning-copying machine. Offers more than other models like HP. Opted for this as it has an auto feeder, which makes copying/scanning of multiple pages much easy. In the HP machine, you had to insert and scan one page at a time. In this, you just load the pages on the feeder and it does it all automatically.

The only downside was the default setup this machine comes with. I would say its very user unfriendly. After spending few hours and browsing through all the forums and international Amazon site, I learnt how to set up this machine for best use. My printer was setup correctly, however on the wireless printing mode, it used to go to sleep mode after a few minutes, and none of my devices were able to detect the printer there after. This was a pain, as I had to eventually go to the machine and restart it to get it out of the sleep mode. Brother needs to fix this as not everyone is good with machines.

Anyways, here is what you should do right after installing the software on your PC.

EDIT: Before reading through the steps below. Make sure you update the firmware on the printer, as it might automatically solve the iissue. If it doesn't, then go through the steps. Firmware can be updated by downloading the Firmware update tool available here: http://support.brother.com/g/b/downloadtop.aspx?prod=dcpl2541dw_as&c=as_ot&lang=en

Go to the printer , Click on the Menu Button, and pull up ""Network"" settings using the buttons on the printer. Under that, go to WLAN and click on set up wizard. Use this to connect your printer to the router/wifi. Once you are connected, do the following steps.

On your printer, press Menu button and :
1. Go to Network->WLAN->TCP/IP->Boot Method - Change it to Static
2. Go to Network->WLAN->TCP/IP-> APIPA - Change it to turn it OFF/Unchecked.
3. Go to Network->WLAN->TCP/IP-> IPv6 - Turn it ON.

After following these steps, your printer will always stay connected to the network. If you don't follow these steps, then your printer will not show up while you try to wirelessly print/scan from your device(after few minutes of turning on the printer). I hope Brother sets up the machine to run these settings by default."
14405,5.0,"I have been a Brother printer user for about 10 years., so I may sound a bit biased here
That being said I would like to say that if you are a small business owner and you don't need color then this is for you. you just can't go wrong with this printer. This copies scans prints impeccably."
14406,5.0,"First of all my reasons of buying this printer: (a) I don't print a lot; the inkjet and ink tank printer head clogs up if not used regularly (b) I hardly print colour but when I do, I wish quality (c) I wanted full networking - Ethernet/Wireless (d) I wanted ADF for scanning/copying and auto duplex printing. This printer ticked all requirements.

The printer arrived today (20-Sep-2020). This is my very first observations review. I will update after 4-6 months. The print quality is superb as with most laser printers.

[A] Packaging & Unpacking: Printer comes with toner in sealed bag, USB cable, the main guide + CD ROM in a pouch, and very neatly packed in the huge box. It had sticker tapes to prevent movement of parts. The quick instruction sheet (A1 size) had neat explanation. There were no issues while unpacking. I installed the toner cartridge in a zilch. The printer is nearly 10 kg and must be ""installed"" at a fixed place - fairly heavy. It is bulky too like most laser printers.
Rating: 5/5.

[B] Setup and installation: The printer comes with a CD ROM. Most laptops today don't have a CD-ROM drive. Not a big issue. I downloaded the s/w from Brother website. I wanted to connect the printer over ethernet. I am fairly competent at networking having setup my complete home network with cable model, wifi router, wifi repeater, a NAS, assigning static IP addresses to important devices, etc. Printer must have a static IP address. I connected the printer via ethernet cable expecting automatic recognition and DHCP address assignment. But I had trouble figuring this out. I could finally enable the Wired Networking on. I enabled Wireless as well and manually set that up. All this one has to on the printer, using menu and +/- and OK keys. It is tedious.

[C] Usage. I was able to print from laptop with no issues once the printer was setup. I have heard about the ""wake up from sleep"" issue. I did not face this issue either. After a good 45 minutes, I printed another page, the printer did take time to wake up but it was not showing offline. Maybe because I have to networked via ethernet. I could scan a legal size page using the ADF - no issues. I was facing this issue with my older Epson L210 printer.

[D] Print from mobile. I was able to print from Samsung M30 and M31 with absolutely no issue. No ""wake up"" problem. The small irritating issue is that paper size defaults to ""Letter"" in mobile print option. But it is a mobile phone issue.

[E] Amazon delivery: Great as always. Delivered in one day in spite of COVID issues.

So far, I am fairly pleased. I am docking 1-star off for installation difficulty."
14407,5.0,"First about price - >During Great Indian Festival Sale, I was able to get it at an unbelievable price of just Rs. 11600/- and considering its MRP is beyond 18000, its was just amazing. (10% bank discount+2k discount during lighting sale+1k cash back)

Now About Delivery Experience -> Horrible. Order got lost during transit and after much request and followup Amazon ordered a new product for me at no additional cost. When the product did come after about 12 days, the delivery people were dropping the product box (which was again entirely sub-standard packing without any amazon boxing) as if it was a bag of cement.

About the product ->
Pros:
1. A True All-in-One Laser Printer. If you do research before buying, its really hard to get every feature in a same printer. This is one such rare printer where you will get almost every feature which any average user can think of.
2. The most useful feature among all is ofcourse the - Wifi & the ADF. Wifi allows you to print it from your laptop or mobile (or PC with wifi adapter). ADF allows you to copy documents by feeding them automatically. It saves a LOT of time than the conventional flatbed scanning and copying.
3. It has Duplex Printing thus allowing to save time and paper both easily
4. Setting up is easy just install using Drivers from CD provided or from the Website of Brother Printer and following the steps. Remember to update firmware as well.
5. The Input tray is closed-type and can hold 250 pages
6. At the risk of getting Warranty Void, Cartridge can be refilled as told by many. Haven't done it yet as I have just bought but YouTube is full of videos showing how to do it using any 3rd party toner powder.
7. Fast and Decent Printing and Copying. Good Scanning as well.

Cons:
1. Costly. If compared to other brands it is costly. Toner and Drum are costly as well. But it has all features so I think its value for money.
2. Cartridge cannot be refilled without getting Warranty Void. Brother Printers should provide Official Toner Powder for Refilling if not 3rd party ones.
3. Delicate and a little flimsy. Quality of plastic is ok but parts are so delicate inside and out that you doubt about its durability.
4. Drawing high electricity and hence cannot be used on UPS or even on most house-Inverters
5. Wifi Setting up is glitchy and re-setting it up is a headache
6. Noisy
7. No duplex Scanning. Only Duplex Printing. Thus while copying no use of auto-duplex feature. Auto-Duplex work only when printing.

Verdict -> If you get it within 15-16k ...go for it...Value for Money, fast and Heavy Duty Laser Printer"
14408,4.0,"I'm a lawyer and it seems perfect for my office. It is slightly technical especially connecting it to the wifi part as we have to do it only on the printer itself which is time taking. I previously used an epson printer where everything could be handled on the app itself.

But once setup it is a breeze. I've got it yesterday and it looks amazing. Will wait and watch the long run performance."
14409,5.0,Nice printing experience..
14410,5.0,likige proble having 1 month
14411,3.0,"After using for few months, here is the key feedback to help my fellow buyers.
1. price is okay
2. product material is not attractive. does not look like it is worth 14.5K
3. packing was okay
4. more importantly for those who are looking for Wifi/Remote
- setup was not easy, one need to do 2 to 3 times to remember. 2-line screen is not a great help. if setup fails, it prints a status report, which is annoying and not needed. it does this everytime something is good or bad. wastes lot of papers
- on each device (laptop), one needs to install the drivers (you can download) from their website. it installs a çontrol center - a menu driven scan application on desktop.
- good way to scan to laptop remotely is - open control center on desktop, keep your paper on the scan glass and then click on scan.
- you can set scanning resolution 600dpi is ok and works fast. if you opt 1200dpi then sit their for a while.. its too slow. so decide which needs which resolution before scanning.
- you can scan continuously pages but by checking the box in control center on scan. I tried via FILE option
- i was not successfully to scan through ADF.
- I tried once to scan on my mobile . it was successful but after a tough time. so one needs to practice and remember trial results. I am yet to gain the confidence.
- more technology means more learning and remember settings.
- the printer and mobile/laptop have to be on the same WIFI. I do not if this is intelligent enough to remember more than one WIFI.
- once check the status of WIFI connection, sometimes notices it becomes inactive though WIFI is on. There is a WIFI button, which glows. but honestly did not understood its use. I felt more problem on pressing as it can reset the WIFI connection. So, friends, play little bit by spending half to 1 day and take worth of the machine.
Now about printing:
- it prints with decent quality. prints one side and also two side (choose long flip). This control you can do from the printing options on your desktop
about Scanner:
- is only A4 size. you can scan one side from glass or from ADF. the door action is little uncomfortable perhaps we have to adjust to that.
- this is big machine so place it at comfortable location, height for ease of use and enjoy.

Over all a good machine. but gave average rating because it is giving what it should do for its price. WIFI, scanning, some of the features could have be easy for the user. Did not like the machine built - looks cheap.could have used a better material. should have provided a cover for that price. I have using this for my personal use and I use it rarely. Brought this because I needed a good printer to print 2-side and scan/print remotely (a true all in one multifunction)

Thanks for reading."
14412,3.0,Nice
14413,5.0,"I have only used this for a few months. Some occasional document printing, nothing heavy. But it works flawlessly, the wifi, the scanning, the printing, duplex printing...and more. Superb value for money so far."
14414,5.0,"Best quality. Printing quality is also good, only problem with wireless printing. Some time not work probably."
14415,4.0,"I would like to assure everyone, who are thinking to purchasing this printer. This is one of the best printer, that could be available at this price range, in the category of monochrome. All the other brands in monochrome printers, have all the fancy features but they are not robust. The cartridge they use is a chip based and offers less print than the claims made. And additional, if the chip gets a problem, you spend extra to get it repaired. And they make printers in such a fashion, that they are dated in some years, so that you buy another one. Brother printer offers you robust printing, scanning, photocopying with auto duplex. Per print cost comes about 0.19 Indian Paisa. They have bit slow services but a reliable one. This printer lasts so longer, with minimal expenses. Worth buying for office, personal, academic purposes."
14416,5.0,"After a thorough research, selected this printer for my home usage. I used couple of other inkjet printers but had issues as my usage was not regular. This time wanted to go for a laser printer. ADF functionality is added advantage in this price point. Wireless setup and Laptop connectivity was an easy process exactly as per the instructions.

Print quality is really superb. I wish that it gives 2,600 pages of printing as promised."
14417,5.0,It has all the features one needs out of a B/W printer.
14418,5.0,"I've ordered this multi function device for my home need and it does a fantastic job. Mostly I am using it for my kid's school assignments. The print quality, duplex printing option, Copy & scan function, Admin tool, etc is simply superb. It's easy to unpack, easy to install. The quality of the print is so neat. Device does not heat up too much and it's noise free operation. Wireless printing option is the added advantage because of which I can place the printer wherever I want and not necessarily in my working table.
Initially I had some trouble in setting up the scanner function (it's my bad that I have used WiFi router's different frequency band in my laptop and in the printer so the scan was not working). I did not have time to explore by reading the [online] manuals so I casually emailed the customer care team just in case if they can send me a reply. Surprisingly, within 2 hours I got a call from them and they have assisted me in screen-sharing mode of all complete set of options available in all functions, the features, setting up various printing options, etc. It was like a one simple online demo. I am super happy and satisfied with this purchase. I will definitely recommend."
14419,5.0," Convenient, Easy use , low power consumption, small size easy to Maintain... Print from mobile with wireless..."
14420,4.0," Very nice product, I like Duplex printing & Automatic document feeder ( ADF).
Thanks Brother.......?"
14421,4.0,"Product is very good, But must prefer installation from trained company engineer. It will easy to install it properly. As it is much difficult to install to a regular person who only using printer. Hence please start company trained installation service for printers or electronic item where installation is required."
14422,5.0,Very poor customer service. Nobody came for the demo. Unable to contact the customer service despite of repeated calls and emails. Product is good but whats the point of a product without the guide
14423,5.0,"I bought the Brother DCP L2541DW laser printer a few days back. I am really impressed by its performance. This is my first Brother product, and I was really apprehensive to switch brands because I have been a fan of another brand for many years. However, my experience with Brother multifunction printer amazed me. The quality, ease of use and intuitive features are some of the advantages that I have noticed. It has wi-fi, auto duplex printing and many other features. If you own a small business or if you are a home user who has lot of print, scan, photocopy requirements, I would definitely recommend this Brother printer. It is affordable and easy to use. If you are a bit tech savvy, you can set it up yourself."
14424,5.0,Print quality is great. It is quite easy to install but if you are a non techie person it might me a bit tough. There no wireless printing issue. If you want to get the best wireless connection you need to set it up with a computer. It’s a great printer for its price. It is go to printer is you are a home user who prints 5to 10 pages per month as the the is no issue of ink drying like inkjet printer.
14425,5.0,I have two printers variant one of is HP brand M126NW and another one is this DCP-L2541DW these both are like similar but BROTHER one is best with good connectivity and quality even speed is super as compare with hp one go with it blindly if u really need good printer .Order with Amazon always best Thanks to amazon service for bring this on time
14426,3.0,Purchased printer all in one DCP L2541DW it is working fine but noice is little bit higher while taking prints otherwise everything is good
14427,4.0,It's a good printer for daily uses at home or office . I like the duplex technology for which I basically bought this. Connected easily with wifi. And last but not the least the customer service is also good as I was facing the difficulty in connecting with wifi they helped me swiftly to resolve the problem.
14428,4.0,No doubt about product.. It is really good but as per companies claims about 2600 prints in first cartridge is false my cartridge finish in only 1546 prints.. And i had to order new cartridge.. So I request not to do any false commitment.. Thanks
14429,5.0,Printing quality and speed is awesome but the scanning speed and scanning quality is really disappointing.
14430,4.0,"Good printer 🖨 I liked it a lot. Print quality is very good and very fast, if your printing one side it takea just 1 second and if your printing duplex it takes 2-3 seconds. Look is very good. Scanning quality is extremely excellent and iven print quality. This is my favorite printer 🖨❤."
14431,5.0,"YOU HAVE TO BUY A NEW TONER, EVERY TIME YOU WANT TO REFILL YOUR INK. I have been using this printer from the past 10 months and yes now i have got to know the reality of brother printers. The biggest drawback is that you cannot refill the toner of this printer, you have to buy another new toner from brother (Third Party Toners NOT ALLOWED) and if you refill the toner or buy a 3rd party toner the warranty gets void. The toner costs you between 2500 to 3000 rupees and it prints around 3500 pages. which means the ink cost per page is RS 1.2 + the A4 size sheet cost, which means one print costs you around Rs 2.2 per page. If you get the toner refilled from outside (brother does not refill), they will ask you for the invoice of a new toner for your printer and if you don't have the invoice for a new toner you cannot claim the warranty. Almost all other printer manufacturers allow to get it refilled from 3rd party or they refill themselves but here you don't have that option. I am adding the picture of toner to give you a clear picture. The customer care wont even listen to you if you don't have an invoice for a new Brother Genuine Toner. Had they been the king then they would have also mandated to your brother electricity, brother air and eventually a brother printer operator or else the warranty will be void. Be smart enough, spending Rs. 2.2 on ink and paper + electricity. I would rather recommend it to get it printed from the market. SAVE YOURSELVES. and if you have one percent doubt that my review is influenced, just call brother customer care and ask them. I hope this review helped you and BROTHER management learns how to cater the Indian customers. If some brother employee is read this, tell your boss ""Sir Indian market has a great potential, i liked the printer but only till the first refill. You need to review your warranty policies and marketing strategy in Indian region"""
14432,5.0,"This is an absolutely great network printer for a small or medium sized office. It does duplex printing and will print on A4 or Legal Sized paper amongst other options. It has a nice large toner store so it will go for a long while before needing a refill and it does auto scanning as well as photocopying. I haven't had to get the ink refilled yet so I don't know how easy or cumbersome that is or how well that works.

It's definitely better than anything I've used from HP or Canon.

Note: Do check online about disabling sleep mode because some people have complained about that. When it goes to deep sleep if you give a print command it won't print unless you go to the printer and wake it up. I disabled it and I haven't had any issues."
14433,4.0,"I am glad that I made this choice. Amazing printer and has everything you would need. Nolonger required to run around stationary shops for print, scan or copy. Installed within minutes with no hassels. Does the job flawlessly, and liked the wireless mobile printing, scanning. Also the ADF feature is great."
14434,4.0,I have a 4 year old HP LASERJET. I use generic ink/toner cartridge for the laser printer. Those last me a month or two with hundreds of pages. The Brother does not last that long. The ink of the hp 126nw lasts very long in comparison. I will update on other benefits of this printer in due course.
14435,4.0,Fake product .
14436,3.0,"At this price point this is simply a wonderful printer with Wireless as well as Duplex feature. The only challenge is the LCD screen which is too small so installing the printer on the WLAN is bit of challenge especially when it comes to typing in the WLAN password. One needs to use the arrow keys provided on the right of the screen to navigate through the keyboard one charachter at a time.

Barring this installing this printer on the wireless network was a breeze and hassle free."
14437,5.0," *WARNING*: Amazon does not accept returns on this product. If you see the return button option, it will not accept it, rather the call will go to Amazon customer service which will say that returns are not possible. So the return button is highly misleading. Once you buy, you are going to be stuck with this product.
As for the printer: It's problematic when a bygone era product is disguised as ""WiFi"" printer. Setup of WiFi is torturous. Connecting is painstakingly difficult. Keep the connection on is chore. The printer randomly goes to sleep mode. WIFI once connected, forgets the connection, you have to go through the whole process again. Who have designed this monstrosity?
If you are thinking that this is a WiFi printer: It's not easy to use the WiFi!
Pros: Seems well made from outside. Test print had good quality. That is the only pro.

Cons are many:
WiFi printing is a hilarious joke. Not possible for average user, i would say difficult for even a little tech savy user.
WiFi printing by Android is very difficult and does not work fast. If you want 5 copies, printer will keep displaying recieving data for eons, and then print one. The next one will then start ' recieving data' for a while and print. I was wrinting this review, and for being silent for a 5 mins the printer printed the 5th copy.
Brother customer service in Pune: 3 phone numbers, none of them working.
Brother customer service number : call any time you are 10th in the line.
I tried to solve the problem by diving deep in my router settings, YouTube videos, internet forums etc. However can a average person have time to do this? Also why should I do this in the first place. I paid more that 17k to do hours of search?
I have never reviewed a product this badly.
And I can't even return this."
14438,1.0,ADP not working. It is just name seek. The software drivers during download and installation are not same. COPY quality also not good. Settings are not user friendly and not impressive.

14444,1.0,"3 stars only because of the support from Brother......otherwise printer is good.

Well time to write a feedback after nine months of usage of this printer.....!! I have been using the same model for over 7 years now in my shop and this is the fourth machine over the years. All previous ones I didn't had any issue till the page count reached well over 1lakh, by that time the regular 1 year warranty is over anyways.

For the latest purchase, the machine started to have issues last week with the duplex tray. upon logging the call, engineer came and the feedback was, since the printer has crossed 50K pages, warranty is void.....!!!

Their terms are - either 1 year or 50K pages printed, whichever comes first, and this 50K page clause is not mentioned anywhere on their site, or on the warranty card that comes along the with the printer.....!!!
I have written communication from support team with the 50K pages mentioned as reason for warranty void....!!!

So if you decide to purchase this, please be ready to deal with the pathetic Brother support team, printer will give you less to none issues, but in case there are any, you will not have a good time dealing with the support team.....!!!"
14445,1.0,"Very difficult to connect. Wireless printing doesn’t work half the times, no matter how many times you repeat the instructions given. Prints fine. Duplex printing works fine."

So far it has heen working really smooth."

I thought it would acan legal size papers but it doesn't, overall good product ."
14453,1.0,"20 years ago I bought a Brother that had issue connecting to the Wifi. Online troubleshooting say to check the router, windows corrupt file etc. The only way to fix it and make it connect to the wifi was to add a space at the end of the network key when using the printer menu to setup the wifi. Now this printer has the same issue. Can't believe Brother still hasn't fixed this. Ridiculous. If you are using the WLAN Setup Wizard thru the printer, enter your network ket and using the symbol list add a ""space"" at the end (there is a ""space"" available in the list). Don't use ""_"" (underscore)."
14454,5.0,"This is an amazing all in one printing-scanning-copying machine. Offers more than other models like HP. Opted for this as it has an auto feeder, which makes copying/scanning of multiple pages much easy. In the HP machine, you had to insert and scan one page at a time. In this, you just load the pages on the feeder and it does it all automatically.

The only downside was the default setup this machine comes with. I would say its very user unfriendly. After spending few hours and browsing through all the forums and international Amazon site, I learnt how to set up this machine for best use. My printer was setup correctly, however on the wireless printing mode, it used to go to sleep mode after a few minutes, and none of my devices were able to detect the printer there after. This was a pain, as I had to eventually go to the machine and restart it to get it out of the sleep mode. Brother needs to fix this as not everyone is good with machines.

Anyways, here is what you should do right after installing the software on your PC.

EDIT: Before reading through the steps below. Make sure you update the firmware on the printer, as it might automatically solve the iissue. If it doesn't, then go through the steps. Firmware can be updated by downloading the Firmware update tool available here: http://support.brother.com/g/b/downloadtop.aspx?prod=dcpl2541dw_as&c=as_ot&lang=en

Go to the printer , Click on the Menu Button, and pull up ""Network"" settings using the buttons on the printer. Under that, go to WLAN and click on set up wizard. Use this to connect your printer to the router/wifi. Once you are connected, do the following steps.

On your printer, press Menu button and :
1. Go to Network->WLAN->TCP/IP->Boot Method - Change it to Static
2. Go to Network->WLAN->TCP/IP-> APIPA - Change it to turn it OFF/Unchecked.
3. Go to Network->WLAN->TCP/IP-> IPv6 - Turn it ON.

After following these steps, your printer will always stay connected to the network. If you don't follow these steps, then your printer will not show up while you try to wirelessly print/scan from your device(after few minutes of turning on the printer). I hope Brother sets up the machine to run these settings by default."
14455,1.0,"I have been a Brother printer user for about 10 years., so I may sound a bit biased here
That being said I would like to say that if you are a small business owner and you don't need color then this is for you. you just can't go wrong with this printer. This copies scans prints impeccably."
14456,1.0,"First of all my reasons of buying this printer: (a) I don't print a lot; the inkjet and ink tank printer head clogs up if not used regularly (b) I hardly print colour but when I do, I wish quality (c) I wanted full networking - Ethernet/Wireless (d) I wanted ADF for scanning/copying and auto duplex printing. This printer ticked all requirements.

The printer arrived today (20-Sep-2020). This is my very first observations review. I will update after 4-6 months. The print quality is superb as with most laser printers.

[A] Packaging & Unpacking: Printer comes with toner in sealed bag, USB cable, the main guide + CD ROM in a pouch, and very neatly packed in the huge box. It had sticker tapes to prevent movement of parts. The quick instruction sheet (A1 size) had neat explanation. There were no issues while unpacking. I installed the toner cartridge in a zilch. The printer is nearly 10 kg and must be ""installed"" at a fixed place - fairly heavy. It is bulky too like most laser printers.
Rating: 5/5.

[B] Setup and installation: The printer comes with a CD ROM. Most laptops today don't have a CD-ROM drive. Not a big issue. I downloaded the s/w from Brother website. I wanted to connect the printer over ethernet. I am fairly competent at networking having setup my complete home network with cable model, wifi router, wifi repeater, a NAS, assigning static IP addresses to important devices, etc. Printer must have a static IP address. I connected the printer via ethernet cable expecting automatic recognition and DHCP address assignment. But I had trouble figuring this out. I could finally enable the Wired Networking on. I enabled Wireless as well and manually set that up. All this one has to on the printer, using menu and +/- and OK keys. It is tedious.

[C] Usage. I was able to print from laptop with no issues once the printer was setup. I have heard about the ""wake up from sleep"" issue. I did not face this issue either. After a good 45 minutes, I printed another page, the printer did take time to wake up but it was not showing offline. Maybe because I have to networked via ethernet. I could scan a legal size page using the ADF - no issues. I was facing this issue with my older Epson L210 printer.

[D] Print from mobile. I was able to print from Samsung M30 and M31 with absolutely no issue. No ""wake up"" problem. The small irritating issue is that paper size defaults to ""Letter"" in mobile print option. But it is a mobile phone issue.

[E] Amazon delivery: Great as always. Delivered in one day in spite of COVID issues.

So far, I am fairly pleased. I am docking 1-star off for installation difficulty."
14457,3.0,"First about price - >During Great Indian Festival Sale, I was able to get it at an unbelievable price of just Rs. 11600/- and considering its MRP is beyond 18000, its was just amazing. (10% bank discount+2k discount during lighting sale+1k cash back)

Now About Delivery Experience -> Horrible. Order got lost during transit and after much request and followup Amazon ordered a new product for me at no additional cost. When the product did come after about 12 days, the delivery people were dropping the product box (which was again entirely sub-standard packing without any amazon boxing) as if it was a bag of cement.

About the product ->
Pros:
1. A True All-in-One Laser Printer. If you do research before buying, its really hard to get every feature in a same printer. This is one such rare printer where you will get almost every feature which any average user can think of.
2. The most useful feature among all is ofcourse the - Wifi & the ADF. Wifi allows you to print it from your laptop or mobile (or PC with wifi adapter). ADF allows you to copy documents by feeding them automatically. It saves a LOT of time than the conventional flatbed scanning and copying.
3. It has Duplex Printing thus allowing to save time and paper both easily
4. Setting up is easy just install using Drivers from CD provided or from the Website of Brother Printer and following the steps. Remember to update firmware as well.
5. The Input tray is closed-type and can hold 250 pages
6. At the risk of getting Warranty Void, Cartridge can be refilled as told by many. Haven't done it yet as I have just bought but YouTube is full of videos showing how to do it using any 3rd party toner powder.
7. Fast and Decent Printing and Copying. Good Scanning as well.

Cons:
1. Costly. If compared to other brands it is costly. Toner and Drum are costly as well. But it has all features so I think its value for money.
2. Cartridge cannot be refilled without getting Warranty Void. Brother Printers should provide Official Toner Powder for Refilling if not 3rd party ones.
3. Delicate and a little flimsy. Quality of plastic is ok but parts are so delicate inside and out that you doubt about its durability.
4. Drawing high electricity and hence cannot be used on UPS or even on most house-Inverters
5. Wifi Setting up is glitchy and re-setting it up is a headache
6. Noisy
7. No duplex Scanning. Only Duplex Printing. Thus while copying no use of auto-duplex feature. Auto-Duplex work only when printing.

Verdict -> If you get it within 15-16k ...go for it...Value for Money, fast and Heavy Duty Laser Printer"
14458,1.0,"I'm a lawyer and it seems perfect for my office. It is slightly technical especially connecting it to the wifi part as we have to do it only on the printer itself which is time taking. I previously used an epson printer where everything could be handled on the app itself.

2. product material is not attractive. does not look like it is worth 14.5K
3. packing was okay
4. more importantly for those who are looking for Wifi/Remote
- setup was not easy, one need to do 2 to 3 times to remember. 2-line screen is not a great help. if setup fails, it prints a status report, which is annoying and not needed. it does this everytime something is good or bad. wastes lot of papers
- on each device (laptop), one needs to install the drivers (you can download) from their website. it installs a çontrol center - a menu driven scan application on desktop.
- good way to scan to laptop remotely is - open control center on desktop, keep your paper on the scan glass and then click on scan.
- you can set scanning resolution 600dpi is ok and works fast. if you opt 1200dpi then sit their for a while.. its too slow. so decide which needs which resolution before scanning.
- you can scan continuously pages but by checking the box in control center on scan. I tried via FILE option
- i was not successfully to scan through ADF.
- I tried once to scan on my mobile . it was successful but after a tough time. so one needs to practice and remember trial results. I am yet to gain the confidence.
- more technology means more learning and remember settings.
- the printer and mobile/laptop have to be on the same WIFI. I do not if this is intelligent enough to remember more than one WIFI.
- once check the status of WIFI connection, sometimes notices it becomes inactive though WIFI is on. There is a WIFI button, which glows. but honestly did not understood its use. I felt more problem on pressing as it can reset the WIFI connection. So, friends, play little bit by spending half to 1 day and take worth of the machine.
Now about printing:
- it prints with decent quality. prints one side and also two side (choose long flip). This control you can do from the printing options on your desktop
about Scanner:
- is only A4 size. you can scan one side from glass or from ADF. the door action is little uncomfortable perhaps we have to adjust to that.
- this is big machine so place it at comfortable location, height for ease of use and enjoy.

Over all a good machine. but gave average rating because it is giving what it should do for its price. WIFI, scanning, some of the features could have be easy for the user. Did not like the machine built - looks cheap.could have used a better material. should have provided a cover for that price. I have using this for my personal use and I use it rarely. Brought this because I needed a good printer to print 2-side and scan/print remotely (a true all in one multifunction)

Thanks for reading."
14462,5.0,Nice
14463,3.0,"I have only used this for a few months. Some occasional document printing, nothing heavy. But it works flawlessly, the wifi, the scanning, the printing, duplex printing...and more. Superb value for money so far."
14464,3.0,"Best quality. Printing quality is also good, only problem with wireless printing. Some time not work probably."
14465,5.0,"I would like to assure everyone, who are thinking to purchasing this printer. This is one of the best printer, that could be available at this price range, in the category of monochrome. All the other brands in monochrome printers, have all the fancy features but they are not robust. The cartridge they use is a chip based and offers less print than the claims made. And additional, if the chip gets a problem, you spend extra to get it repaired. And they make printers in such a fashion, that they are dated in some years, so that you buy another one. Brother printer offers you robust printing, scanning, photocopying with auto duplex. Per print cost comes about 0.19 Indian Paisa. They have bit slow services but a reliable one. This printer lasts so longer, with minimal expenses. Worth buying for office, personal, academic purposes."
14466,4.0,"After a thorough research, selected this printer for my home usage. I used couple of other inkjet printers but had issues as my usage was not regular. This time wanted to go for a laser printer. ADF functionality is added advantage in this price point. Wireless setup and Laptop connectivity was an easy process exactly as per the instructions.

Print quality is really superb. I wish that it gives 2,600 pages of printing as promised."
14467,1.0,It has all the features one needs out of a B/W printer.
14468,3.0,"I've ordered this multi function device for my home need and it does a fantastic job. Mostly I am using it for my kid's school assignments. The print quality, duplex printing option, Copy & scan function, Admin tool, etc is simply superb. It's easy to unpack, easy to install. The quality of the print is so neat. Device does not heat up too much and it's noise free operation. Wireless printing option is the added advantage because of which I can place the printer wherever I want and not necessarily in my working table.
Initially I had some trouble in setting up the scanner function (it's my bad that I have used WiFi router's different frequency band in my laptop and in the printer so the scan was not working). I did not have time to explore by reading the [online] manuals so I casually emailed the customer care team just in case if they can send me a reply. Surprisingly, within 2 hours I got a call from them and they have assisted me in screen-sharing mode of all complete set of options available in all functions, the features, setting up various printing options, etc. It was like a one simple online demo. I am super happy and satisfied with this purchase. I will definitely recommend."
14469,5.0," Convenient, Easy use , low power consumption, small size easy to Maintain... Print from mobile with wireless..."
14470,1.0," Very nice product, I like Duplex printing & Automatic document feeder ( ADF).
Thanks Brother.......?"
14471,4.0,"Product is very good, But must prefer installation from trained company engineer. It will easy to install it properly. As it is much difficult to install to a regular person who only using printer. Hence please start company trained installation service for printers or electronic item where installation is required."
14472,5.0,Very poor customer service. Nobody came for the demo. Unable to contact the customer service despite of repeated calls and emails. Product is good but whats the point of a product without the guide
14473,4.0,"I bought the Brother DCP L2541DW laser printer a few days back. I am really impressed by its performance. This is my first Brother product, and I was really apprehensive to switch brands because I have been a fan of another brand for many years. However, my experience with Brother multifunction printer amazed me. The quality, ease of use and intuitive features are some of the advantages that I have noticed. It has wi-fi, auto duplex printing and many other features. If you own a small business or if you are a home user who has lot of print, scan, photocopy requirements, I would definitely recommend this Brother printer. It is affordable and easy to use. If you are a bit tech savvy, you can set it up yourself."
14474,3.0,Print quality is great. It is quite easy to install but if you are a non techie person it might me a bit tough. There no wireless printing issue. If you want to get the best wireless connection you need to set it up with a computer. It’s a great printer for its price. It is go to printer is you are a home user who prints 5to 10 pages per month as the the is no issue of ink drying like inkjet printer.
14475,1.0,I have two printers variant one of is HP brand M126NW and another one is this DCP-L2541DW these both are like similar but BROTHER one is best with good connectivity and quality even speed is super as compare with hp one go with it blindly if u really need good printer .Order with Amazon always best Thanks to amazon service for bring this on time
14476,4.0,Purchased printer all in one DCP L2541DW it is working fine but noice is little bit higher while taking prints otherwise everything is good
14477,3.0,It's a good printer for daily uses at home or office . I like the duplex technology for which I basically bought this. Connected easily with wifi. And last but not the least the customer service is also good as I was facing the difficulty in connecting with wifi they helped me swiftly to resolve the problem.
14478,1.0,No doubt about product.. It is really good but as per companies claims about 2600 prints in first cartridge is false my cartridge finish in only 1546 prints.. And i had to order new cartridge.. So I request not to do any false commitment.. Thanks
14479,5.0,Printing quality and speed is awesome but the scanning speed and scanning quality is really disappointing.
14480,1.0,"Good printer 🖨 I liked it a lot. Print quality is very good and very fast, if your printing one side it takea just 1 second and if your printing duplex it takes 2-3 seconds. Look is very good. Scanning quality is extremely excellent and iven print quality. This is my favorite printer 🖨❤."
14481,1.0,"YOU HAVE TO BUY A NEW TONER, EVERY TIME YOU WANT TO REFILL YOUR INK. I have been using this printer from the past 10 months and yes now i have got to know the reality of brother printers. The biggest drawback is that you cannot refill the toner of this printer, you have to buy another new toner from brother (Third Party Toners NOT ALLOWED) and if you refill the toner or buy a 3rd party toner the warranty gets void. The toner costs you between 2500 to 3000 rupees and it prints around 3500 pages. which means the ink cost per page is RS 1.2 + the A4 size sheet cost, which means one print costs you around Rs 2.2 per page. If you get the toner refilled from outside (brother does not refill), they will ask you for the invoice of a new toner for your printer and if you don't have the invoice for a new toner you cannot claim the warranty. Almost all other printer manufacturers allow to get it refilled from 3rd party or they refill themselves but here you don't have that option. I am adding the picture of toner to give you a clear picture. The customer care wont even listen to you if you don't have an invoice for a new Brother Genuine Toner. Had they been the king then they would have also mandated to your brother electricity, brother air and eventually a brother printer operator or else the warranty will be void. Be smart enough, spending Rs. 2.2 on ink and paper + electricity. I would rather recommend it to get it printed from the market. SAVE YOURSELVES. and if you have one percent doubt that my review is influenced, just call brother customer care and ask them. I hope this review helped you and BROTHER management learns how to cater the Indian customers. If some brother employee is read this, tell your boss ""Sir Indian market has a great potential, i liked the printer but only till the first refill. You need to review your warranty policies and marketing strategy in Indian region"""
14482,5.0,"This is an absolutely great network printer for a small or medium sized office. It does duplex printing and will print on A4 or Legal Sized paper amongst other options. It has a nice large toner store so it will go for a long while before needing a refill and it does auto scanning as well as photocopying. I haven't had to get the ink refilled yet so I don't know how easy or cumbersome that is or how well that works.

It's definitely better than anything I've used from HP or Canon.

Note: Do check online about disabling sleep mode because some people have complained about that. When it goes to deep sleep if you give a print command it won't print unless you go to the printer and wake it up. I disabled it and I haven't had any issues."
14483,4.0,"I am glad that I made this choice. Amazing printer and has everything you would need. Nolonger required to run around stationary shops for print, scan or copy. Installed within minutes with no hassels. Does the job flawlessly, and liked the wireless mobile printing, scanning. Also the ADF feature is great."
14484,5.0,I have a 4 year old HP LASERJET. I use generic ink/toner cartridge for the laser printer. Those last me a month or two with hundreds of pages. The Brother does not last that long. The ink of the hp 126nw lasts very long in comparison. I will update on other benefits of this printer in due course.
14485,5.0,Fake product .
14486,3.0,"At this price point this is simply a wonderful printer with Wireless as well as Duplex feature. The only challenge is the LCD screen which is too small so installing the printer on the WLAN is bit of challenge especially when it comes to typing in the WLAN password. One needs to use the arrow keys provided on the right of the screen to navigate through the keyboard one charachter at a time.

Barring this installing this printer on the wireless network was a breeze and hassle free."
14487,5.0," *WARNING*: Amazon does not accept returns on this product. If you see the return button option, it will not accept it, rather the call will go to Amazon customer service which will say that returns are not possible. So the return button is highly misleading. Once you buy, you are going to be stuck with this product.
As for the printer: It's problematic when a bygone era product is disguised as ""WiFi"" printer. Setup of WiFi is torturous. Connecting is painstakingly difficult. Keep the connection on is chore. The printer randomly goes to sleep mode. WIFI once connected, forgets the connection, you have to go through the whole process again. Who have designed this monstrosity?
If you are thinking that this is a WiFi printer: It's not easy to use the WiFi!
Pros: Seems well made from outside. Test print had good quality. That is the only pro.

Cons are many:
WiFi printing is a hilarious joke. Not possible for average user, i would say difficult for even a little tech savy user.
WiFi printing by Android is very difficult and does not work fast. If you want 5 copies, printer will keep displaying recieving data for eons, and then print one. The next one will then start ' recieving data' for a while and print. I was wrinting this review, and for being silent for a 5 mins the printer printed the 5th copy.
Brother customer service in Pune: 3 phone numbers, none of them working.
Brother customer service number : call any time you are 10th in the line.
I tried to solve the problem by diving deep in my router settings, YouTube videos, internet forums etc. However can a average person have time to do this? Also why should I do this in the first place. I paid more that 17k to do hours of search?
I have never reviewed a product this badly.
And I can't even return this."
14488,1.0,ADP not working. It is just name seek. The software drivers during download and installation are not same. COPY quality also not good. Settings are not user friendly and not impressive.
14489,5.0,"Like the printer very much. Print quality is very good,easy to maintain, all necessary features available, minimal sound while scanning, quality is just awesome, highly recommended."

Pls give clarity... Item arrived in time...good service....
14492,3.0,Best in class MFP serving maximum needs in this budget. Provides auto duplex printing which is not available in this range. Printing and scanning speed is perfect. Toner life is also good
14493,4.0,This Printer is working excellent
14494,1.0,"3 stars only because of the support from Brother......otherwise printer is good.

Well time to write a feedback after nine months of usage of this printer.....!! I have been using the same model for over 7 years now in my shop and this is the fourth machine over the years. All previous ones I didn't had any issue till the page count reached well over 1lakh, by that time the regular 1 year warranty is over anyways.

For the latest purchase, the machine started to have issues last week with the duplex tray. upon logging the call, engineer came and the feedback was, since the printer has crossed 50K pages, warranty is void.....!!!

Their terms are - either 1 year or 50K pages printed, whichever comes first, and this 50K page clause is not mentioned anywhere on their site, or on the warranty card that comes along the with the printer.....!!!
I have written communication from support team with the 50K pages mentioned as reason for warranty void....!!!

So if you decide to purchase this, please be ready to deal with the pathetic Brother support team, printer will give you less to none issues, but in case there are any, you will not have a good time dealing with the support team.....!!!"

So far it has heen working really smooth."

14506,1.0,"The most confusing dilemma an user would face when looking for a printer - LASER OR INKJET.. A Question with a lot of sub-questions...
1) INITIAL EXPENSE(High Product Expense) or AFTER PURCHASE EXPENSE(high ink costs)?
2) Black & White or COLOR?
3) Single Function or Multi Function?

Before i start sharing my experience on this one, let me share my past, my previous printer experience- one of the most terrible and bitter experiences i had in my life and that too because of another world class company's product - EPSON ME 340 INKJET MULTIFUNCTION PRINTER..

After doing extensive research on several brands(HP,Canon,Epson) and types(Laser and Inkjet) of printers, i made a most terrible decision - to purchase EPSON ME 340. I don't believe in bad luck or fate..it was only because,i made some slight miscalculations or may be my whole research was on the wrong side.. :(
My primary intention was to get a printer for home use- to satisfy my academic printing requirements. The reasons which influenced me in making my decision were

1) At that time, EPSON was the only one supporting 3rd Party Ink Tanks, so less printing cost can be achieved and that too with a Multi Function Color Printer.
2) The crooked salesman at my local IT shop cheated me by giving a false promise, that installing a 3rd Party Company tank won't affect my product's guarantee. he also said he had handled several similar cases without any issues.. I was totally trusting this guy...
3) Last but not least..i was so much blindly obsessed with brand EPSON's reputation..

Guess what happened? After spending an eye whooping amount of around 5600Rs (3800+ For Printer and 1800+ for ink tank),
My printer stopped working just after 6 months of usage. When i called the IT shop, they totally refused their earlier words and offers in providing the assistance in claiming guarantee and they told me that it's main board of the printer that became faulty and in order to make it work again,i should spend another 3000+ and when i contacted company service, they refused to provide me guarantee due to additional modifications which i have made to the printer.. well i don't blame them, standard company regulations.. it was my fault to believe that crooked mind...

NOW ABOUT THE PRESENT......
After a year, due to heavy printing requirements(Final year project documentation,seminar, reference materials,etc) i thought of purchasing another printer again. This time i have made a firm decision at the beginning itself..i will purchase from a reputed online seller. After my detailed comparison tests and scrutinies, found 2 best devices to suit my needs- HP 2520hc and Canon Image Class MF 3010.

Out of these two,i finally decided to go with canon because
1) i have very good experience with two canon products before(canon ixus digital camera) and canon projector.
2) Most of the other online sellers were offering these printers for prices near to their MRPs without any substantial discounts, but when i saw the price of canon MF 3010 @ amazon i was astonished.... around 24% discount to MRP...7650Rs instead of 9900Rs.

Initial Experience--> Printing Quality is excellent...Very fast printing compared to slow inkjet printers(First paper out in less than 5-7 seconds)..Can't talk about toner mileage since i have printed only few papers..Scanning Quality is one of the best among this class of printers... An amazing feature i found in the copier other than normal copy is to select 3 modes-

1) Paper Save(2 papers on one side) or Card Copier(to take the copies of small identity cards)
2) Brightness adjustment(to set density of black color, by this way we can effectively increase the mileage of toner bin)
3) Enlargement( could easily set the screen ration of the copying process either 50% to around 200%)

The only con which i found in this printer so far is the absence of duplex printing feature (2 sided printing at the same time)..

In overall i would definitely recommend this to any one looking for a home printer which could produce cheap prints..You can simply purchase it without even thinking...Because, that's the level of trust Canon is offering here... I'm Completely Satisfied... :)"

I received the product within one week. But when I unboxed the product it damaged (corner of scanner glass as mentioned in the picture)the box was not damaged at all. It was a perfect packing but may be manufacturing defect or idk whatever. I returned the product and got the refund within the day. Iam happy about that with Amazon customer service. Fine i will order another that's all my overall experience with the product through online

14513,3.0,I'm totally happy with this product.. worth it.
14514,3.0,"Best for small home setup and light office work. For two side print, you need to manually flip the paper. You can print multiple size papers but scan a maximum A4 size. Print quality scan quality is good. You need to install drivers for scanner to work. Drivers available with pre packed CD or on the website."

14516,4.0,"Hey guys I'm a student and I typically needed a good printer.I researched for laser printer and that too with multifunction after a week I came to conclusion with Canon mf3010 and Hpm1136 same lies under a range of 9000. Now coming to the printer the print quality is superb, scan function and copy function is working fine. But only one issue not with the printer but the power cable which came with the printer is slightly loose connection but it doesn't matter since you can interchange your monitor power cable with it. That works fine for me...... If you are a student go for it. Google cloud print is also supported and it's really easy to setup and all those things.. And I found there is no complete video review in YouTube but don't worry this is the right printer Cannon is the main supplier of Hp I got this printer for 8660"

14527,3.0,"I did not want the hassle of ink drying and then printing at least one page in 15-20 days so I did not go for an inkjet printer. I also wanted print/copy/scan and this was the cheapest with those features. Did not want Samsung, because I do not trust their quality.
Was considering the HP InkAdvantage series printer, company says that ink doesnt dry even if a print is not taken for 2 months, but found that it is not true, 15-20 days is the max limit.
A friend is using this printer since a year now and is very happy with it hence I also bought it. Its good."
14528,1.0,Design better than HP. easy to use. print copy scan speed better than HP. copy and print quality is ok not better or similar to HP. I observed HP printers sound is less than canon and sharp and clear print. canon giving light print. better to go for HP Laserjet Pro M126nw.

14531,1.0,Cannon 3010 Printer is the right choice for small business and office use. Good printing quality.
14532,5.0,"This printer is of good quality. I just started using the printer. I haven't used a lazer printer before expect at office. Compared to the office printer it works perfectly fine. Good print quality. Scanning is not upto the mark compared to an inkjet i had. But for a low cost printer like this and multi function it is good. I haven't yet copied any document but still. I expect a good quality on that too.

Overall this is a printer which can be used at home. I would not recommend this for rough use."

14556,5.0,"The most confusing dilemma an user would face when looking for a printer - LASER OR INKJET.. A Question with a lot of sub-questions...
1) INITIAL EXPENSE(High Product Expense) or AFTER PURCHASE EXPENSE(high ink costs)?
2) Black & White or COLOR?
3) Single Function or Multi Function?

Before i start sharing my experience on this one, let me share my past, my previous printer experience- one of the most terrible and bitter experiences i had in my life and that too because of another world class company's product - EPSON ME 340 INKJET MULTIFUNCTION PRINTER..

After doing extensive research on several brands(HP,Canon,Epson) and types(Laser and Inkjet) of printers, i made a most terrible decision - to purchase EPSON ME 340. I don't believe in bad luck or fate..it was only because,i made some slight miscalculations or may be my whole research was on the wrong side.. :(
My primary intention was to get a printer for home use- to satisfy my academic printing requirements. The reasons which influenced me in making my decision were

1) At that time, EPSON was the only one supporting 3rd Party Ink Tanks, so less printing cost can be achieved and that too with a Multi Function Color Printer.
2) The crooked salesman at my local IT shop cheated me by giving a false promise, that installing a 3rd Party Company tank won't affect my product's guarantee. he also said he had handled several similar cases without any issues.. I was totally trusting this guy...
3) Last but not least..i was so much blindly obsessed with brand EPSON's reputation..

Guess what happened? After spending an eye whooping amount of around 5600Rs (3800+ For Printer and 1800+ for ink tank),
My printer stopped working just after 6 months of usage. When i called the IT shop, they totally refused their earlier words and offers in providing the assistance in claiming guarantee and they told me that it's main board of the printer that became faulty and in order to make it work again,i should spend another 3000+ and when i contacted company service, they refused to provide me guarantee due to additional modifications which i have made to the printer.. well i don't blame them, standard company regulations.. it was my fault to believe that crooked mind...

NOW ABOUT THE PRESENT......
After a year, due to heavy printing requirements(Final year project documentation,seminar, reference materials,etc) i thought of purchasing another printer again. This time i have made a firm decision at the beginning itself..i will purchase from a reputed online seller. After my detailed comparison tests and scrutinies, found 2 best devices to suit my needs- HP 2520hc and Canon Image Class MF 3010.

Out of these two,i finally decided to go with canon because
1) i have very good experience with two canon products before(canon ixus digital camera) and canon projector.
2) Most of the other online sellers were offering these printers for prices near to their MRPs without any substantial discounts, but when i saw the price of canon MF 3010 @ amazon i was astonished.... around 24% discount to MRP...7650Rs instead of 9900Rs.

Initial Experience--> Printing Quality is excellent...Very fast printing compared to slow inkjet printers(First paper out in less than 5-7 seconds)..Can't talk about toner mileage since i have printed only few papers..Scanning Quality is one of the best among this class of printers... An amazing feature i found in the copier other than normal copy is to select 3 modes-

1) Paper Save(2 papers on one side) or Card Copier(to take the copies of small identity cards)
2) Brightness adjustment(to set density of black color, by this way we can effectively increase the mileage of toner bin)
3) Enlargement( could easily set the screen ration of the copying process either 50% to around 200%)

The only con which i found in this printer so far is the absence of duplex printing feature (2 sided printing at the same time)..

In overall i would definitely recommend this to any one looking for a home printer which could produce cheap prints..You can simply purchase it without even thinking...Because, that's the level of trust Canon is offering here... I'm Completely Satisfied... :)"

14561,5.0,The product was actually perfect for my use. Pretty decent size with scanner. Demerit:-It don't have wifi connectivity. Price of the product was also decent. I received the product within one week. But when I unboxed the product it damaged (corner of scanner glass as mentioned in the picture)the box was not damaged at all. It was a perfect packing but may be manufacturing defect or idk whatever. I returned the product and got the refund within the day. Iam happy about that with Amazon customer service. Fine i will order another that's all my overall experience with the product through online
14562,4.0,"Best product, value for money"
14563,5.0,I'm totally happy with this product.. worth it.
14564,1.0,"Best for small home setup and light office work. For two side print, you need to manually flip the paper. You can print multiple size papers but scan a maximum A4 size. Print quality scan quality is good. You need to install drivers for scanner to work. Drivers available with pre packed CD or on the website."
14565,5.0,I like this product all 3 are available in one printer which is very handy to use.
14566,5.0,"Hey guys I'm a student and I typically needed a good printer.I researched for laser printer and that too with multifunction after a week I came to conclusion with Canon mf3010 and Hpm1136 same lies under a range of 9000. Now coming to the printer the print quality is superb, scan function and copy function is working fine. But only one issue not with the printer but the power cable which came with the printer is slightly loose connection but it doesn't matter since you can interchange your monitor power cable with it. That works fine for me...... If you are a student go for it. Google cloud print is also supported and it's really easy to setup and all those things.. And I found there is no complete video review in YouTube but don't worry this is the right printer Cannon is the main supplier of Hp I got this printer for 8660"
14567,3.0,Not user friendly. No WiFi. For me the printer didn't work atall and I'm returning the product
14568,1.0,"Nice product, price little bit high"

14572,5.0,"So far this works good. One disappointment is it does not have wi-fi option.

Not sure why WI-FI option not included in this product."
14573,4.0,we had purchased printer Canon MF 3010 as on 22.02.22 after that we had refill cartridge as on 11.03.22 but now we didnt get quality print please suggest
14574,4.0,Very nice
14575,5.0,Good and sturdy product.
14576,5.0,"Review created after 2 hours of setup and testing the following
I am taking away one star because Yosemite could not scan wireless through MF Toolbox (BonJour does not detect the wireless printer)
- Photocopying without using a laptop or computer
- Windows 64 bit scanning wireless
- Windows 64bit printing
- Mac Yosemite printing
- Windows 64bit printing with wireless R8000 Netgear
- Mac Yosemite printing with wireless R8000 Netgear

-- Easy setup
-- Small Footprint
-- Light weight
-- Print quality is 8/10
-- Startup is crazy fast
-- Great pricing
-- Good availability of Windows and Mac drivers"
14577,1.0,"I did not want the hassle of ink drying and then printing at least one page in 15-20 days so I did not go for an inkjet printer. I also wanted print/copy/scan and this was the cheapest with those features. Did not want Samsung, because I do not trust their quality.
Was considering the HP InkAdvantage series printer, company says that ink doesnt dry even if a print is not taken for 2 months, but found that it is not true, 15-20 days is the max limit.
A friend is using this printer since a year now and is very happy with it hence I also bought it. Its good."
14578,3.0,Design better than HP. easy to use. print copy scan speed better than HP. copy and print quality is ok not better or similar to HP. I observed HP printers sound is less than canon and sharp and clear print. canon giving light print. better to go for HP Laserjet Pro M126nw.
14579,4.0, Likr
14580,4.0,"hi friends. i just buy this printer from amazon and it was really really best deal form me. because when i was searched printers in market that experience was so adorable because not a single dealer never told me accurate price and function and they were recommend inkjet printers..but fortunately i looked out this one on amazon and without waste any second i booked it. printer is very good and better than best . HP ,EPSON ,SAMSUNG, etc etc..are adorable and not in range of common customer.. don't think so much just buy this. .. really happy with this product. i have already canon digital camera and now canon printer...its really CAN ON your happiness and i m sure you will get better benefits..."
14581,5.0,Cannon 3010 Printer is the right choice for small business and office use. Good printing quality.
14582,1.0,"This printer is of good quality. I just started using the printer. I haven't used a lazer printer before expect at office. Compared to the office printer it works perfectly fine. Good print quality. Scanning is not upto the mark compared to an inkjet i had. But for a low cost printer like this and multi function it is good. I haven't yet copied any document but still. I expect a good quality on that too.

Overall this is a printer which can be used at home. I would not recommend this for rough use."
14583,5.0,the profile on this page says that this printer is duplex (both side printing) but in reality I am unable to print both sided so could you either explain me right way or change the information already provided immediately
14584,5.0,Very difficult to install by searching different videos on YouTube. Still i couldn't do it. Not started using after trying a lot.
14585,4.0,Best quality printing...
14586,4.0,Printer is good.. but is makes lot sound while printing.. .. 10 k is ok for this product.. for 12k it is waste
14587,4.0,very niche product.. easy to use office work and very fast printing
14588,5.0,Nice
14589,4.0,Value for money
14590,4.0,"Best quality printing, easy to use , save curtigde, save ink"
14591,5.0,Print quality is very good but print quantity is not so much refill it every 6 to 700 pages.
14592,5.0,Best
14593,3.0,Awesome
14594,3.0,"The printer is very good but if you are planning to make it wireless with your raspberry pi then you will run into issues. Canon ones aren't usually supported by CUPS printing service and its a night mare to try to setup.

So take this if you are plannign to use a separate print server or as a standalone printer. Doesn't work with raspberry pi."
14595,5.0,Good
14596,5.0,no installation assistance was provided. Manual provided does not help much.
14597,3.0,"The machine has more RAM than comparable models. Hence it is able to print faster.
The scan functionality is supported by a good software.
It has a cover for the feed paper so that as to protect the paper in the tray against dust.
The machine also turns on fast. I have used models from another popular brand and find hat this one performs much better."
14598,5.0,Worth the money. Its durability is nice and great to use for office too.
14599,5.0, Dislike
14600,5.0,Overall Good printer no Any Problems midrange with scanner Best Printer
14601,5.0,"While printing, Facing some problem like couldn’t able to print directly from Gmail. If you want to print documents from Email, you need to download that. Not advisable!"
14602,5.0,"Product is as Specified.
But the Problem is, Back and Back Printing. Due to Over heat in Drum, Papers Get rolled while it comes out. So we cant place the paper back for another side.(if we place the paper back, it gets jammed)

Product is best only for One side printing/Copying.

Also Cartridge is Half filled. only 800 Pages printed. We have to go for new cartridge after that."
14603,4.0,Budget product. Installation was a headache. Did not know if it was done or not. But wireless printing is working somehow. Gets the job done.
14604,4.0,"Shipment received in time on 25 th Sept. Due to lack of time i could test the product recently. It is working fine. Wi Fi set up could not perform successfully, i shall try again shortly. Other function are working satisfactory. Only worried is that the cost of its Ink Cartridges."
14605,3.0,"Nice combo.
Clear print. Less noisy.
Should come with a cover and also head cleaner device."
14606,5.0,"Bought this for print/scan from smartphone using wifi.
Quality is good, printing speed is good.
One issue is that after switch on and first print is command is given, it does take some time to initialize and make banging sounds. But after first print, it is quick.
scan is good quality, you can scan a page in PDF or JPG and multiple docs into single PDF.
single biggest pain : INK cartridge is very costly and one original Canon cartridge does not print as many pages as claimed.
cost is fine, equivalent laser printer would cost 18,000+ so economy wise good for those people who need urgent prints but only few per week."
14607,4.0,"Nice printer with decent quality, wifi pairing if not easy and requires more ink"
14608,4.0,"Print quality is really good however you will need to increase the brightness of the photos and enhance it before printing.
There is no borderless printing option.you can see in the pics I have posted are not printed full to the page.
First pic posted is the original ink which came with the canon cartridge and the second pic with a Mike in hand was printed after refilling the cartridge.

You can print around 100-150 4*6 color photos. I haven't counted the black and white prints though. Printing speed is also good if you are looking for a cheap and good printers for home use you can definitely count on it.

The only drawback is it cannot print borderless photos in all size papers.

You can use wireless feature only with in the range of 1-10 meters.

Use VMS IMPERIAL 270 GSM 4R GLOSSY PHOTO PAPER for good quality prints as per my opinion rest you can depend on your own research."
14609,4.0,"The Product arrived neatly packed. While there was an instruction sheet, it did not fulfil the requirement of how to set it up across devices and across network options. The official video link on the instruction Manual went to 'page not found' and I had to go through a bunch of videos uploaded by customers until I found one that served my purpose of setting it up with my Smartphone. The Canon website did not even list this product for a product demo.

Canon should ideally address this basic requirement from customers.

But once I figured it out, it's easy peazy to uee it. 🙂"
14610,5.0,Nice
14611,5.0,"Print quality is very good. You can connect it with your pc via USB cable & you can connect it with your pc or mobile using wifi. The wifi connection is not so smooth,you can find difficulties but if you follow the instructions on the manual you can fix all the problems. This printer can be used for printing, scanning & copying. Also it's printing cost per page is very low as compare to other inkjet printers. It is a very good budget printer."
14612,4.0,"Pros:
1) The Best / only wifi all in one printer in the range of 5k with ink saver (so called).
2) Low usage required & low maintenance: Thought of buying ink tank but learnt from friends that it's suitable for heavy printing and when they didn't use it for a while repairs needed. Hence decided to go for inkjet with low cost maintenance. This doesn't require daily print like ink tanks.
3) product is solid built and no issues observed so far. Many long term reviews also confirmed flawless working for years so decided this model.
4) Print quality: Black is very good but colour is average. Does the job for kids school project purpose.
5) Easy setup : It's very easy to setup if you are techy. Setting up WiFi took little bit of time (an hour). I hate reading manuals and it was first time with a printer at home.
6) Wi-Fi printing via mobile is a breeze with Canon Selphy app. Easy photo editor by canon is also quite useful /handy.

Cons:
1) Black is good but Colour is pretty average. Like I said good enough for home /students purpose.
2) Not happy with cartidges supplied by Canon. They seem to fill only half or less for demo purpose. It gave around 100 pages for black and 15-20 pages of color with lowest quality settings (where in they claim 250 Black and 100 color). Both cartidges were almost empty and mobile app started showing the same.
2) Ink cartidges cost & yield: The cost cartridges seems to be increasing (when I was purchasing this it was around 500 for black but now it's around 600) and I had no faith on the yield based on what I have got with stock cartidges. It's not worth buying cartidges so go for refill.
3) We only find CL 57S Which is small. Where is Cl 57 (large size) ? Couldn't find anywhere online."
14613,5.0,"Remote printing and scanning easy. Scan quality good. Print OK.
Value for money. You may need help for installation."
14614,1.0,Excellent Product . Need to refer online manual for wifi connection . There is change in steps as given hard copy manual comes with box.

Informed to customer care Mr. Shubam excellent response from the team and delivered a new product within 3 days .
Now the product is excellent I liked the most .
Thank you Amazon team for quick response to customer complaints I appreciate it ."
14619,5.0,"Its compact , easy to install and good for home purpose. I was confused as I read they reviews about installation but it was absolutely smooth and I was able to do it with ease. Not being a tech savvy person, it's a great deal for me if I can install a WiFi printer successfully. The tricky part was loading the cartridge, it was pretty skilled. I really, it's ink jet printer but with all three functions, it's a good buy for this value. Go ahead and get it."
14620,1.0,"With scan, print, copy and wifi connectivity its a complete economical printer for home use. Good product."
14621,3.0,"The product was delivered on time and was packed well. Printer is light weight and easy to connect the cartridges. But installing software was not easy. I called up Canon customer care but they told that they cant provide any support and asked to visit local service centre. Then struggling for some time, then I found a way out to install the software online. Now, it's working well. Inshort, Printer is good and Customer care is not helpful."
14622,5.0,"I bought this cannon e477 with two more additional color and block cordage as mentioned for this printer, working good. But for me it is useful for certain color page print for documentation. overall Wi-Fi connectivity at ease, but transfer rate very slow and even for printing from pc too. Need more patience."
14623,4.0,Good
14624,4.0,This printer is good for home use. It helpful for competitive exam aspirant who are daily take print 20 to 50 pages. But ink cartridges are so expensive. If you use some third party ink's it will reduce the cartridges cost.

14631,5.0,All is okay
14632,1.0,Canon e477 printer is a multifunction printer has good quality printout. There is a time delay for colour printing. Scanner was easily operated. Good choice for home use.
14633,5.0,"It wouldn't install wirelessly, so I plugged in the USB cable, searched on Google for Canon's product installation webpage, and it quickly installed everything necessary for both wired and WiFi use. It prints and scans well. Everything I printed was grayscale. Apparently, grayscale isn't the same as black-and-white. Grayscale uses a small amount of colour ink in addition to black. So I used up some colour ink needlessly. 30 pages of grayscale brought both the colour ink and black ink levels down by 10%. So from now on, I'll use black-and-white, and not grayscale. Overall, I like this printer. The wifi is solid everywhere in the house, and the phone app is useful. Printing and scanning from an Android phone is very easy."
14634,5.0,It is easy to use and working aa per expectations
14635,4.0,"Light weight and Printing is good. Tried only A4 paper Printing so far. Happy but disappointed to know the printer has no landscape printing facility.

14644,2.0,Prints of sophisticated pdf files with lots of datas are incomplete and remaining lots of space blank. This printer is not suitable for office purpose. However it is much of a help for children for study use.
14645,4.0,"Don't have high expectations. It's a simple printer/scan/copy - it's just about average. I guess it's a budget printer for low-intensity use.

The ""wifi"" feature makes the price worth it.

It is bulkier than what one would imagine from the pictures.

14647,4.0,i like using app for printing pages wirelessly. but setup information was not very clear. finally i gone thru a youtube video and installed. even the cd they have given step by step information but i dont see option to choose printer driver setup in both ways like either wifi or usb. i was able to setup with only wifi or usb but not both. but believe me setup was really pathetic. but once its done and we are able to take one fine print then we are happy to print many pages without any obstacles

14649,4.0,"Good for home usage if your printing needs are very less. Printing quality is good, better than those Xerox centers outside, but not the best. makes a lot of notice when you switch it on, don't know why. Copy works fine and quick too.

Ink levels show a drastic fall in the app when checked for ink levels, especially the color prints. The ISO numbers are far away from reality. Bought this for kid's school projects, and it does the job."

1) Black is good but Colour is pretty average. Like I said good enough for home /students purpose.
2) Not happy with cartidges supplied by Canon. They seem to fill only half or less for demo purpose. It gave around 100 pages for black and 15-20 pages of color with lowest quality settings (where in they claim 250 Black and 100 color). Both cartidges were almost empty and mobile app started showing the same.
2) Ink cartidges cost & yield: The cost cartridges seems to be increasing (when I was purchasing this it was around 500 for black but now it's around 600) and I had no faith on the yield based on what I have got with stock cartidges. It's not worth buying cartidges so go for refill.
3) We only find CL 57S Which is small. Where is Cl 57 (large size) ? Couldn't find anywhere online."

14671,4.0,"Its compact , easy to install and good for home purpose. I was confused as I read they reviews about installation but it was absolutely smooth and I was able to do it with ease. Not being a tech savvy person, it's a great deal for me if I can install a WiFi printer successfully. The tricky part was loading the cartridge, it was pretty skilled. I really, it's ink jet printer but with all three functions, it's a good buy for this value. Go ahead and get it."
14672,5.0,"With scan, print, copy and wifi connectivity its a complete economical printer for home use. Good product."
14673,5.0,"The product was delivered on time and was packed well. Printer is light weight and easy to connect the cartridges. But installing software was not easy. I called up Canon customer care but they told that they cant provide any support and asked to visit local service centre. Then struggling for some time, then I found a way out to install the software online. Now, it's working well. Inshort, Printer is good and Customer care is not helpful."
14674,4.0,"I bought this cannon e477 with two more additional color and block cordage as mentioned for this printer, working good.

14684,2.0,Canon e477 printer is a multifunction printer has good quality printout. There is a time delay for colour printing. Scanner was easily operated. Good choice for home use.
14685,3.0,"It wouldn't install wirelessly, so I plugged in the USB cable, searched on Google for Canon's product installation webpage, and it quickly installed everything necessary for both wired and WiFi use. It prints and scans well. Everything I printed was grayscale. Apparently, grayscale isn't the same as black-and-white. Grayscale uses a small amount of colour ink in addition to black. So I used up some colour ink needlessly. 30 pages of grayscale brought both the colour ink and black ink levels down by 10%. So from now on, I'll use black-and-white, and not grayscale. Overall, I like this printer. The wifi is solid everywhere in the house, and the phone app is useful. Printing and scanning from an Android phone is very easy."

14697,4.0,"Don't have high expectations. It's a simple printer/scan/copy - it's just about average. I guess it's a budget printer for low-intensity use.

The ""wifi"" feature makes the price worth it.

It is bulkier than what one would imagine from the pictures.

Color cartridge at best would come for 20 pages and B&W for 30 pages."
14699,4.0,i like using app for printing pages wirelessly. but setup information was not very clear. finally i gone thru a youtube video and installed. even the cd they have given step by step information but i dont see option to choose printer driver setup in both ways like either wifi or usb. i was able to setup with only wifi or usb but not both. but believe me setup was really pathetic. but once its done and we are able to take one fine print then we are happy to print many pages without any obstacles

14701,4.0,"Good for home usage if your printing needs are very less. Printing quality is good, better than those Xerox centers outside, but not the best. makes a lot of notice when you switch it on, don't know why. Copy works fine and quick too. Not tried scanning yet, and I actually do not require this feature.

Ink levels show a drastic fall in the app when checked for ink levels, especially the color prints. The ISO numbers are far away from reality. Bought this for kid's school projects, and it does the job."

14710,4.0,"A little about this printer:
1) Build quality: 3/5 - flimsy and prone to paper jams if paper is not inserted carefully.
2) Scan quality: 4/5 - really impressed with this one.
3) Print quality: 3/5 - OK for casual use. Not great, not bad either.
4) Software and drivers: 3/5 - installs a lot of unnecessary plugins, which cannot be unselected during installation. You have to manually remove each one after installation (e.g FTP plugin, Dropbox plugin, etc.)
5) Cartridges: 1/5 - no surprises here... 6 prints in, and the provided cartridges' ink levels have already dropped to 75%.
6) Additional points - unlike Canon, HP has its own Android app to print from a mobile phone via USB OTG cable, so that's a plus.

Since I only use a printer/scanner for emergencies (2-3 prints a month), I always go for the cheapest option, which in this case was this one for Rs. 3099/-. The only difference between HP DeskJet 2331 and 2332 is the colour (the former is violet-white and this one is grey-white) so grab whichever is cheaper. Inkjet printers are a scam in general - the printers are cheap but the cartridges are crazy expensive and the ink runs out before you can say the word 'PRINT'. If you're the type who prints a lot, better go for a laser printer. They are more cost efficient in the long run."

Easy to use and set up, print quality mediocre, build quality flimsy not as good as my old HP printer.

A detailed review on the results:

Everything works perfect from what I expected from this printer.

Powered ON and could do a copy of my aadhaar colour copy in one button click.
(Separate buttons for colour copy and b/w copy).

Then, installed HP Smart application and printed (both colour and b/w).
Installation gave me some troubles. After first of installation, the printer was not detected.
I downloaded the HP printer drivers from different URL and installed it again.
I don't know what made the change. It started working.
But, I spent around 2 hours.

We can scan up to A4 size documents. Allows to scan in three resolutions - 300dpi, 600dpi, 1200dpi.
Scan with 300dpi itself is good.

The pulling of paper is perfect - one sheet at a time in a clean way.
Does not pull out more papers or no paper jam.

So far I have printed around 20 colour copies, two A4 size photos and 20 b/w copies.
HP smart application shows 50% colour cartridge remaining, 80% b/w cardridge remaining.

Buy a third party refill ink kit (that is compatible for HP 805 cartridge).
This will help reusing the cartrigde for 2 to 3 times.

I printed photos on Kodak 230GSM paper. Reasonably ok quality.
But, I need to print and check on other GSM paper to see if I get better results.

Note: To protect the cartridges from ink drying out, they should not be left unused for more than a week's time. In deskjet printers, Cartridges are the main challenge."

My recommendation -dont buy bcz it's cheap buy good one"
14726,5.0,"Writing review after a month. The print quality is good for general printing and also for photo printing on glossy papers. I printed almost 80 black and white pages and about 10 color pages. Yeah, the black cartridge is empty now. And by watching YouTube videos I refilled my black cartridge , with Aprodot ink (cost around Rs. 120) and it worked well. (Just put ~3 mL of ink in cartridge hole by a syringe). The printer costs me Rs. 3300.
Overall good printer ... better if you buy a wireless printer else it is awesome. And don't believe if anyone says refilling a cartridge don't work , as long you would take necessary precautions (just watch YouTube video) it will work fine.
JUST AN ADVICE - Cover your printer with cloth whenever you aren't using it :)"

Utility-wise, my needs are very little, like school assignment prints 2/3 time a week of 2/3 page.
Light weight, decently good print and speed out.
Original catridge colours are coming good. Will have to see how this works over 3/4 months. It's just 2 weeks for me now.
Saw a comment that the android app helps from mobile printing. But, the machine itself is not Wifi enabled. It is a basic colour printer, coming under Rs. 5k budget, which I got at Rs. 3.2K, I can only wish it was there."
14729,3.0,"Printer looks premium, gets prints faster and ecomonic. The main problem is the ink. I just took less than 20 pages and the ink got over. A new cartridge will cost u around 750rs. So for just 20 prints u have to pay 750 rs. Who will purchage for this kind of stuff. If i pay 1rs i will get a Xerox copy. The purpose of buying a printer is for our convenience. Premium and build quality doesn't matter if the ink provided is such a rubbish. I will give 5 star for the quality of the printer and 1 star for printing."
14730,5.0,"The printer is super easy to use and install and scanner works great. We don't print often but the cartridges start drying up after a few months. For the first use we could print about 20-30 high quality text documents and 1 color photo but since it ran out of ink (which ideally it shouldn't have) we got the xl cartridge, original from the HP online store. And now after only about 15 textual draft quality prints over the last 6 months the xl black cartridge has run out! Only conclusion is that it is drying up. Too expensive and they have probably not considered Indian heat conditions for ink quality."
14731,5.0,"As an old loyal HP printer customer, I am thoroughly impressed that they keep working to improve the user experience. There was no ""brick"" of a power supply - just the cable. Opening up the ox, and setting up the printer was easy, as always. I was a tad apprehensive about going to the HP website to download and install the appropriate driver etc. But they have done a great job to make it real simple, and it brings up the app to control the machine too. Excellent - keep up the good work. Highly recommend this for the home user or small office"

14733,5.0,Everything is good speed is good for black and white it takes 4 to 8 secs according to material you have to print and also depends upon quantity which you want draft normal or the high quality same for colour about 8 to 12 secs and scanner is also doing well use hp smart app for printing it is easy to use you can buy ink from Amazon of wroth 400 and refills the cartridges easily even then buy a new cartridge of worth 8000 and after filling it prints about 120 pages and 80 colour pages one can refill. Cartridge in one minute it is very easy i print had 400 pages in one very good product when i go to buy it i also worry about the comments of another people who are saying it is bad but i think they didn't know how to use it don't worry and go for it if you are able to use it well then you find it best
14734,2.0,Good product
14735,3.0,"It's really easy to install and use for printing. No need to add it as printer in you laptop just attaching USB cord is fine. But for scanning I am still struggling how to to do that.

14737,4.0,"I did order for HP DeskJet 2332 All-in-One Inkjet Colour Printer with 805 Tri-Color Original Ink Cartridge. Instead of receiving Tri-Color Cartridge, I had received Complementary Cartridge of both Black & Color Cartridge. Though I was not aware of the requirement of both cartridges for this printer, luckily received these two solved my immediate installation issue.
Not sure that complementary is allowed for this item.
With single or few numbers of paper in the input tray, struck up and the cross-feeding problem is noticed."
14738,4.0,"Works fine for the price I paid as an entry level printer . Needed to do a few prints during WHF and supports that perfectly. Once you get the drivers downloaded and setup it works fine . Need to restart the laptop from time to time when prints don’t go through but I think it’s a common software issue I’ve faced with another HP deskjet printer too
I had to order ink cartridges again as the ones supplied are just for starting and don’t have a lot of ink , so if you plan on printing a lot it makes sense to order that when your buying the printer"
14739,4.0,"If you are doing regular printing or official work then I would not recommend this, as this does not have ADF.

But if you print sometimes or occasionally like me for admit cards. train / plane tickets or other docs, then go for it. It has what it says, print, scan and copy features both color and black & white, I havee done all, no issues and comes at much lower price and that too from HP. So it is a good deal overall for home use.

Before using it make sure to remove all tapes inside as well as outside (there will be a manual for it in package so don't worry), slide the shifter where you put blank pages as it is not adjusted for A4 sized papers, load the cartridges properly (comes with the printer and easy to load as well) and register the product & install the software & drivers for it from HP site."

14754,4.0,"Mainly bought it for the scanner. Cartridges become dry if you don't use regularly. Mobile can't be connected to the printer. Every time you need a PC/Laptop for printing or scanning. But for copy/xerox you can use it directly.
My advice is to go for a wireless one."
14755,4.0,Good company but ink problem
14756,4.0,"I wanted a printer for occasional use that would be economical also , so basis the description went ahead with this one. It says it comes with a preloaded cartridge ( black and colour) and can print 100 pages with one cartridge ( black ). I printed max 15 pages in first use ( 12 black and white and 3 colour). The next time I had to print something was a month later and the cartridge was out of ink already even though the levels were still showing the same as before. By the way the ink levels were showing low even when the printer was installed after delivery. I didn’t have the time to fight with Amazon for that so just let it go. It’s the worst ever experience and so disappointing to see Hp and Amazon both get away by selling such a shoddy product and also cheating the customer by sending almost empty catridges with a new product ( also doubtful because the printer had some dust marks but Amazon wasn’t ready to exchange and wanted to dump another one which we denied ). Please don’t buy this printer from Amazon and if you do please ensure to check if the cartridge is full."

But, I need to print and check on other GSM paper to see if I get better results.

Note: To protect the cartridges from ink drying out, they should not be left unused for more than a week's time. In deskjet printers, Cartridges are the main challenge."

1) based on uses less useage buy it more useage try to buy costly one @15k+ i think .."
14771,4.0,"It is very hard to set up the printer and especially filling up its cartridges is a tedious task, it often shows error in printing."
14772,5.0,Quality is good but not for commercial use only for own use...
14773,4.0,Slow speed
14774,4.0,"First it doesnot include driver software and i have to search drive software on google and download. second i cannot use the software directly as windows need update to use it. third the ink have very low level. after around 5 to 10 pages of colour print, the colour ink emptied. black ink also exhausted soon. fourth paper tray is not good, printer always missed to take up paper and get jammed or else. proper putting of paper in the tray is difficult."
14775,3.0,"Nice printer, easy to use and good quality prints"
14776,3.0,"Don't buy because it's cheap....it's one time usable once this printer printer 60-70pages then cartridge will empty and u have to buy new which is too costly and if u wanna to refill by watching YouTube videos it's depend on your luck because this cartridge is one time usable ...they are selling at low cost because they just wanna to sell their printers .....if u find so many positive comments may be their frnds relatives writing to divert you.
My recommendation -dont buy bcz it's cheap buy good one"
14777,4.0,"Writing review after a month. The print quality is good for general printing and also for photo printing on glossy papers. I printed almost 80 black and white pages and about 10 color pages. Yeah, the black cartridge is empty now. And by watching YouTube videos I refilled my black cartridge , with Aprodot ink (cost around Rs. 120) and it worked well. (Just put ~3 mL of ink in cartridge hole by a syringe). The printer costs me Rs. 3300.
Overall good printer ... better if you buy a wireless printer else it is awesome. And don't believe if anyone says refilling a cartridge don't work , as long you would take necessary precautions (just watch YouTube video) it will work fine.
JUST AN ADVICE - Cover your printer with cloth whenever you aren't using it :)"

14779,3.0,"Thanks Amazon and the Seller: Packing was good and delivery on time.
Utility-wise, my needs are very little, like school assignment prints 2/3 time a week of 2/3 page.
Light weight, decently good print and speed out.
Original catridge colours are coming good. Will have to see how this works over 3/4 months. It's just 2 weeks for me now.
Saw a comment that the android app helps from mobile printing. But, the machine itself is not Wifi enabled. It is a basic colour printer, coming under Rs. 5k budget, which I got at Rs. 3.2K, I can only wish it was there."
14780,4.0,"Printer looks premium, gets prints faster and ecomonic. The main problem is the ink. I just took less than 20 pages and the ink got over. A new cartridge will cost u around 750rs. So for just 20 prints u have to pay 750 rs. Who will purchage for this kind of stuff. If i pay 1rs i will get a Xerox copy. The purpose of buying a printer is for our convenience. Premium and build quality doesn't matter if the ink provided is such a rubbish. I will give 5 star for the quality of the printer and 1 star for printing."
14781,3.0,"The printer is super easy to use and install and scanner works great. We don't print often but the cartridges start drying up after a few months. For the first use we could print about 20-30 high quality text documents and 1 color photo but since it ran out of ink (which ideally it shouldn't have) we got the xl cartridge, original from the HP online store. And now after only about 15 textual draft quality prints over the last 6 months the xl black cartridge has run out! Only conclusion is that it is drying up. Too expensive and they have probably not considered Indian heat conditions for ink quality."
14782,4.0,"As an old loyal HP printer customer, I am thoroughly impressed that they keep working to improve the user experience. There was no ""brick"" of a power supply - just the cable. Opening up the ox, and setting up the printer was easy, as always. I was a tad apprehensive about going to the HP website to download and install the appropriate driver etc. But they have done a great job to make it real simple, and it brings up the app to control the machine too. Excellent - keep up the good work. Highly recommend this for the home user or small office"
14783,5.0,"If ur usage is more than 100 pages per month then go for a leser printer, this cartridge will print only 100 pages"
14784,4.0,Everything is good speed is good for black and white it takes 4 to 8 secs according to material you have to print and also depends upon quantity which you want draft normal or the high quality same for colour about 8 to 12 secs and scanner is also doing well use hp smart app for printing it is easy to use you can buy ink from Amazon of wroth 400 and refills the cartridges easily even then buy a new cartridge of worth 8000 and after filling it prints about 120 pages and 80 colour pages one can refill. Cartridge in one minute it is very easy i print had 400 pages in one very good product when i go to buy it i also worry about the comments of another people who are saying it is bad but i think they didn't know how to use it don't worry and go for it if you are able to use it well then you find it best
14785,3.0,Good product
14786,4.0,"It's really easy to install and use for printing. No need to add it as printer in you laptop just attaching USB cord is fine. But for scanning I am still struggling how to to do that.
Print quality is ok.If you want good print quality go for higher price."
14787,4.0,"It's a very useful, although the process of downloading the app and installing it and getting it paired ithe printer could have been less complicated, once you have done it then it becomes very easy to use and gives you nice results."
14788,4.0,"I did order for HP DeskJet 2332 All-in-One Inkjet Colour Printer with 805 Tri-Color Original Ink Cartridge. Instead of receiving Tri-Color Cartridge, I had received Complementary Cartridge of both Black & Color Cartridge. Though I was not aware of the requirement of both cartridges for this printer, luckily received these two solved my immediate installation issue.
Not sure that complementary is allowed for this item.
With single or few numbers of paper in the input tray, struck up and the cross-feeding problem is noticed."
14789,4.0,"Works fine for the price I paid as an entry level printer . Needed to do a few prints during WHF and supports that perfectly. Once you get the drivers downloaded and setup it works fine . Need to restart the laptop from time to time when prints don’t go through but I think it’s a common software issue I’ve faced with another HP deskjet printer too
I had to order ink cartridges again as the ones supplied are just for starting and don’t have a lot of ink , so if you plan on printing a lot it makes sense to order that when your buying the printer"
14790,4.0,"If you are doing regular printing or official work then I would not recommend this, as this does not have ADF.

But if you print sometimes or occasionally like me for admit cards. train / plane tickets or other docs, then go for it. It has what it says, print, scan and copy features both color and black & white, I havee done all, no issues and comes at much lower price and that too from HP. So it is a good deal overall for home use.

Before using it make sure to remove all tapes inside as well as outside (there will be a manual for it in package so don't worry), slide the shifter where you put blank pages as it is not adjusted for A4 sized papers, load the cartridges properly (comes with the printer and easy to load as well) and register the product & install the software & drivers for it from HP site."
14791,5.0,Worst Printer such a poor quality never seen
14792,5.0,Dislike owing to fact catridge cost is very high
14793,4.0,Ok
14794,4.0,Over all good but ink consumption is very high. I have a hp laptop and it sync with it very easily. Takes time to print even black and white prints. Not good for office.
14795,4.0,"It does what it says. It prints well, scans well & also copy well too. Its super easy to install. As the price is less, can't complain much but the printing cost is too high. Its good for occasional printing. I tried by printing color photos to glossy papers but the quality is not that good. Overall good experience."
14796,4.0,"First I got the message that the order is been delivered but in actual it's not then I raised a request for return since there is no option for complaint on the product delivery apart from phone number Hence Amazon team quickly resolved my query and then the printer is delivered within 4 hours that time I thought I got trapped but it gets resolved quickly Thanks for that. As of now, it is working as expected let's hope for the best in the future."

14804,4.0,Kadak mal 🥰bole to jakas
14805,4.0,"Mainly bought it for the scanner. Cartridges become dry if you don't use regularly. Mobile can't be connected to the printer. Every time you need a PC/Laptop for printing or scanning. But for copy/xerox you can use it directly.
My advice is to go for a wireless one."
14806,4.0,Good company but ink problem
14807,4.0,"I wanted a printer for occasional use that would be economical also , so basis the description went ahead with this one. It says it comes with a preloaded cartridge ( black and colour) and can print 100 pages with one cartridge ( black ). I printed max 15 pages in first use ( 12 black and white and 3 colour). The next time I had to print something was a month later and the cartridge was out of ink already even though the levels were still showing the same as before. By the way the ink levels were showing low even when the printer was installed after delivery. I didn’t have the time to fight with Amazon for that so just let it go. It’s the worst ever experience and so disappointing to see Hp and Amazon both get away by selling such a shoddy product and also cheating the customer by sending almost empty catridges with a new product ( also doubtful because the printer had some dust marks but Amazon wasn’t ready to exchange and wanted to dump another one which we denied ). Please don’t buy this printer from Amazon and if you do please ensure to check if the cartridge is full."

Had tough time on installing it on windows 11 , since it end up saying ""printer not connected""
Tried to reach support line and they said it is a carry in warrnty and shared the local agent number to walkin and fix.
Managed to install the driver manually and able to add the printer it.
we need to pick the USB (Sure it will have cannon word on it), by default it picked LTP for me and i was not able to connect to printer , After changed the USB and picked the correct connection , printer started working without any issue.

14931,4.0,"I have bought this Printer on March-2022, the default ink cartridge which comes along with the printer did not even last for 15-20 pages, I assumed that it is because they provide a sample cartridge along with the printer. So, I purchased another brand new cartridge within few weeks and the result remained almost the same. Not able to take more than 35 pages. Which is worse when compared with the old HP printer I have used.

So, this printer is eating my money. I would never ever suggest Canon to any of my colleagues as it is a waste of money."
14932,4.0,This is budget friendly printer. Easy to use and am using it since many months. It's working perfect.
14933,3.0,"Although Printer is good but you can use it for one time only. Once the ink finished you can not refill it because either its hard to find the market or when you found, it will cost you around INR 1500/- which is not worthy as the whole printer cost is INR 2899/-. So don't buy this."
14934,1.0,"The print quality is good,
The cartridges came with the printer has very less ink, hardly prints 10pages.

The cartridges are costly per paper the cost is around 7rs.

But if we refill with 3rd part ink the quality is slightly degraded, but the price comes down..
With 300rs ink bottles can print 6000pages easily.
I have used needle ink , purchased from Amazon.

Printer is recommended if you cannable to refill."
14935,4.0,Nice
14936,3.0,Installing the device just made me crazy. On the 1st try it never gets installed. It takes generally 2-3 times to install. The default ink cartridge is very small. Just after 25 prints it's giving low ink signal. Good for scanning A4 documents. It is all in one.
14937,4.0,Good pritner. The ink will be costly. For high volume printing ink tank would be better option.
14938,4.0,The product is valuable for money
14939,4.0,"Consumes too much ink. Though mentioned can print 100 pages in black, but with installed cartridge can hardly print 50 pages with nominal texts and after 30 pages, showing low ink warning."
14940,4.0,Product is good but cartridge defective no value for money
14941,2.0,"Printer is okay, print quality is okay but too much expensive of the print price due to the cartages are not durable. Only printed 10 pages totally and currently showing low of cartage (to be filled). But manual is showing cartage will print approx. 100 pages of colour and black & white. Disappointed regarding the efficiency of Canon brand and product cartage.😢😢"
14942,5.0,Ok
14943,5.0,I have reduced star for only one reason. The ink gets over quickly need frequent reinstallation
14944,3.0,"Purchased a couple of weeks ago.
The product was delivered the very next day, even though standard delivery was chosen. Pleasantly surprised!! Thanks Amazon.
Here are a few highlights that I'd like to share:
1. Easy installation, a blessing for all!
2. Superb print quality and good print speed - especially for A4 size full page colour pictures.
3. Easy to use buttons, no complications! (Pls refer picture)
4. Two tone blue & white body colour renders an elegant look. It helps that the blue is super dark bordering on black and yet, not black.
5. Easy to load paper through back tray.
6. Still using the starter cartridges, so waiting to see how long these shall last.
7. New cartridges are easily available on amazon, as are refill ink bottles (for those who are thus inclined!)

Overall a solid product.

Five stars!"

14949,3.0,"Inexpensive. But catriges prices are rip off. Prints too few pages. If you need to print even 30 pages a month only, this is not the printer for you."
14950,5.0,"This printer is great for home use but there is one important thing to know you cannot print a larger size glossy photo. Only 6x4 is allowed. But paper print can be printed to any size not larger than A4. I didn’t like it much when I got to know that it was not capable of printing the photo to my desired size. The main purpose of my buying this product was to print glossy photos. Other than that, it's great. Also, remember that the ink cartridge is a little more expensive."
14951,1.0,Good
14952,1.0,Good
14953,5.0,Printer costs around 3k Black+CMYK Ink cartridges (small) costs 1500. changing the inks another time is the same as buying another printer. And the ink lasts much below their given minimum of 45 pages.
14954,1.0,"I have used this model since 2017 in US Then bought this one again in India. Both worked and works great. Scanner is more than what I expected. I was planning to get Canon Canoscan Lide 300 or 400 scanner (cost 5000-6000, only scanner) but then thought to buy this model again as this comes with printer. Its 600 DPI scanner is doing great job. Printer is also good but ink is very expensive. I dont like that.
Otherwise great buy."
14955,5.0,Ok product not said that it's best in market but in this price 3330 its good product easy to use and print out is good but sometimes it's trouble to understand it
14956,5.0,printing and scanning is very good but very COSTLY
14957,5.0,Useful
14958,1.0,"I needed a printer for home use. I was looking for something basic with all the three important features that a printer should have such as Printing, Copying and scanning. And like I said I needed something basic because for home use at best you're gonna need 4-5 prints in a month usually and not more. So I found this printer which I received just today. Does it do what it says? Yes, It does and overall it's a great product and I am quite satisfied with it's quality and features. Although the print quality could've been slightly better. Don't get me wrong overall it's a great product for it's price and comes with all the necessary accessories that you would need for a printer but the print quality is just above average. It does the job and it doesn't look bad. Just not great like you can see in other slightly expensive brands. Anyway I don't regret buying it. I still got more than what I paid for, therefore I am quite satisfied."
14959,5.0,"I bought this very recently. So far so good. It is economical. We can print, copy, scan is what I liked.

What I didn't like is - the USB cable from printer to connect to external device (computer) could have been longer that what is given. It is tough sometimes to connect with laptop or computer which is placed just a bit longer to the printer.

What is missing - WiFi. Hmm, need to spend some more money for this. But it could have come for this price itself given the technology advancements so far ! I know I shouldn't expect though!

I'm happy as I've been using scan and prints (less) for a while. I used it for <2months now, since last week it won't turnon now :-) Not sure of the reason. Time to contact the customer support now :-).

If I get quick resolution in few days, then I'd update here and improve the rating ! Hence giving less rating for now!"
14960,4.0,"Print out on a paper is not satisfactory, appear linening on it and not solvable with new cartridge , is it on warranty period?!"
14961,1.0,"Product got delivered on next day of Order , pack was intact.
many complained on the Printer ink, they pack 'S' ink tanks so we cannot expect more prints , i belive , we need to wait and watch on usage.
Print quality was good, good scanner.
Had tough time on installing it on windows 11 , since it end up saying ""printer not connected""
Tried to reach support line and they said it is a carry in warrnty and shared the local agent number to walkin and fix.
Managed to install the driver manually and able to add the printer it.
we need to pick the USB (Sure it will have cannon word on it), by default it picked LTP for me and i was not able to connect to printer , After changed the USB and picked the correct connection , printer started working without any issue.
will update the journey..........."
14962,1.0,It requires more ink
14963,5.0,"Probably it's for regular use, not for residential with few uses.
The inkjets become dry too fast making it very expensive to maintain"
14964,1.0,Good
14965,1.0,Once your ink runs out you have to buy a new cartilage which costs 1000 rupees for a small one . If we buy colour and black both it costs 1900 and if ink runs out again we have to buy the cartilage again and again which will make the ink more costly than the printer.

14972,5.0,"At first seeing the negative reviews i was little bit afraid.but when I use the product it's working nicely but to install the device is little bit complicated. And the second problem is that the ink we get is small and within 4,5 print the ink will finish then we want to purchase New ink this is the only problem with this but anyway I like the printer and the printing quality is also good.this printer is good for this rate."
14973,4.0,"Its convenient since covid, i started working from home and this helps with both office and kids school work. So far so good."
14974,1.0,"Even though the price of the printer is low it becomes very expensive when you print. The ink cartridges got depleted by taking copy of less than 60 copy, that to documents. Replacement cartridges cost Rs. 1300 making the cost of printing Rs. 20 per page. So not advisable for regular use. Would suggest to go for little expensive ink tank models or laser printers."
